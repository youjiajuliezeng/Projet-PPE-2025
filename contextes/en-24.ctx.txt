   The content and function of dreams have been topics of scientific,
   philosophical and religious interest throughout recorded history. Dream

   seek to conclude with definite meaning. The scientific study of dreams
   is called oneirology.^[9] Most modern dream study focuses on the
   neurophysiology of dreams and on proposing and testing hypotheses
   regarding dream function. It is not known where in the brain dreams
   originate, if there is a single origin for dreams or if multiple
   regions of the brain are involved, or what the purpose of dreaming is
   The human dream experience and what to make of it has undergone sizable
   writings from Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt, dreams dictated post-dream
   millennia.^[clarification needed] These ancient writings about dreams
   highlight visitation dreams, where a dream figure, usually a deity or a
   prominent forebear, commands the dreamer to take specific actions, and
   which may predict future events.^[12]^[13]^[14] Framing the dream
   Dreaming and sleep are intertwined. Dreams occur mainly in the
   REM,^[15] linking dreams to REM sleep has led to conjectures that
   animals dream. However, humans dream during non-REM sleep, also, and
   not all REM awakenings elicit dream reports.^[16] To be studied, a
   dream must first be reduced to a verbal report, which is an account of
   the subject's memory of the dream, not the subject's dream experience
   itself. Therefore, dreaming by non-humans is currently unprovable, as
   is dreaming by human fetuses and pre-verbal infants.^[17]

   dreams were the best way to receive divine revelation, and thus they
   would induce (or "incubate") dreams. They went to sanctuaries and slept
   on special "dream beds" in hope of receiving advice, comfort, or
   healing from the gods.^[14] From a Darwinian perspective dreams would

   The ancient Hebrews connected their dreams heavily with their religion,

   other ancient cultures, incubated dreams in order to receive a divine

   the false dream, which may come from the devil (shaytan), and finally,
   the meaningless everyday dream (hulm). This last dream could be brought
   forth by the dreamer's ego or base appetite based on what they
   experienced in the real world. The true dream is often indicated by
   the Prophet, it is said that the Prophet's dreams would come true like

   Lucid dreaming is the conscious perception of one's state while
   dreaming. In this state the dreamer may often have some degree of
   control over their own actions within the dream or even the characters
   and the environment of the dream. Dream control has been reported to
   improve with practiced deliberate lucid dreaming, but the ability to
   control aspects of the dream is not necessary for a dream to qualify as
   "lucid"—a lucid dream is any dream during which the dreamer knows they
