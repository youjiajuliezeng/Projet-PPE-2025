   NEW YORK (AP) — When she was still just a child, Meg Donnelly gave off
   a serious theater kid vibe. At 5, her favorite musical role wasn’t the
   sunny “Annie.” It was Mimi from “Rent,” the struggling erotic dancer
   who is also a heroin addict.

   Donnelly grew up to become a film and TV star through her breakout role
   in Disney’s music-filled “Zombies” franchise and the ABC sitcom
   “American Housewife.” She’s also appeared on “The Masked Singer” and
   has a new EP, “dying art.”

   This week, the New Jersey-raised actor returned to her first love —
   theater. Donnelly made her Broadway debut Tuesday in “Moulin Rouge! The
   Musical,” playing cabaret star Santine. She’ll be aboard the jukebox
   hit until March.

   The show is about the goings-on in a turn-of-the-century Parisian
   nightclub, updated with tunes like “Single Ladies” and “Firework”
   alongside the big hit “Lady Marmalade.”

   The Associated Press got a chance to ask Donnelly about her big night
   and how it fits into her blossoming career. Answers have been edited
   for clarity and brevity.

AP: What was your debut like?

   DONNELLY: It was really surreal. I feel like I’ve been working towards
   this since I was a little girl. When I was younger, Broadway was the
   only option. I was a full theater kid — that’s all I wanted to do. And,
   you know, life just took me in different directions. But this is
   something that I feel I was born to do and just being on stage last
   night, it kind of all just makes sense.

AP: You’re in the Al Hirschfeld Theatre. Do you think you ever saw a show
there before?

   DONNELLY: I definitely do. I saw “Kinky Boots” twice. I love “Kinky
   Boots.” And I think I saw “Kiss Me Kate” there, too.

AP: What’s your favorite musical?

   DONNELLY: My favorite musical of all time is “Rent.” I saw it a lot
   when I was younger — maybe when I was too young — and my dream role has
   always been Mimi, which is really funny. So when I was like 5 or 6
   auditioning for theater, they would be like, “What’s your dream role?”
   And everyone would be, like, “Annie” or “Matilda” and I’d be like,
   “Mimi!” They’d be like, “Oh my God, this kid!” So, it is very full
   circle because “Moulin Rouge” is based on the same opera as “Rent.”
   Satine is kind of Mimi.

AP: So much of your career makes this a natural step. You played a young
woman who sang in a school production of “Little Shop of Horrors” on
“American Housewife” and everything about the “Zombie” franchise screams
musical theater. How do you describe your path here?

   DONNELLY: There’s not a right or wrong path. You know, there’s so many
   things in my career where I’m like, “Oh, I wish I’d done that” or
   “Maybe I should have gone that way.” I’m a very chronic over-thinker.
   But it really doesn’t matter. I will say, being a part of Disney
   definitely changed my life.

AP: Another Broadway-adjacent step was when you were in the cast of NBC’s
live telecast of “The Sound of Music” in 2013. You were the understudy for
Louisa von Trapp, right?

   DONNELLY: Yes, I understudied Louisa and Ella Watts-Gorman, who played
   Louisa, was so talented and amazing. I was praying that nothing
   happened to her. We weren’t really taught much. We knew the music, but
   that was pretty much it, so I was like, “Dear God, please, let
   everything go OK.”

AP: Audra McDonald starred in that, right?

   DONNELLY: Oh my god. Listening to her sing on set was one of the best
   gifts I’ve ever been given.

AP: What about your own music?

   DONNELLY: That is something that I really want to pursue. I feel like
   writing my own music is just so therapeutic for me, and I love
   performing on stage. Having to do a new show every single night and
   making everything different and feeding off the energy of the different
   crowd — that’s what I want to do with my own music as well.

AP: You did theater growing up alongside Helen J. Shen, who created her part
in “Maybe Happy Ending,” right? Would you also like to originate a role one
day?

   DONNELLY: That was such a cool thing to watch her go through and it’s
   so personal, something that she built with them. That would be really,
   really cool. Just to have that connection to it as well. So, yeah,
   originating would be really like that would great.
