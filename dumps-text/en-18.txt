The science of dreams: what happens in the brain when we dream

TL;DR:

   What happens when we dream may still feel mysterious, but research is
   beginning to uncover what’s happening in the brain. During REM sleep,
   brain activity increases—especially in the regions that regulate memory
   and emotion. While the science behind dreams is still unfolding,
   experts believe dreaming helps us process emotions, store key memories,
   and prepare for challenges we face when awake.

   dreams, meditation, sleep

   Let’s be real - dreams are dreamy. There’s so much we don’t know about
   them, and yet they can reveal so much. From flying through clouds to
   seeing people from your past, our dreams are full of mystery and
   meaning.

   For centuries, humans believed dreams were messages from the gods or
   windows into the subconscious(1).Today, science is beginning to unpack
   what really happens in the brain while we sleep—and why dreams might
   serve a deeper purpose than we once thought.

   In this article, we’ll explore the science behind dreaming: how dreams
   are formed in the brain, what REM sleep really does, and why you often
   can’t remember a single thing by morning.

How do dreams work?

   Dreaming has fascinated humans for centuries. When you look at ancient
   civilizations, they believed dreams were prophecies or divine messages
   (2), and Freud later proposed they revealed repressed desires (2).
   While the exact purpose of dreaming remains unclear, modern science has
   shifted the conversation from symbolism to brain function, offering new
   insights into what happens when we sleep(3).

REM sleep

   REM sleep, known as the stage where dreams are most vivid—activates
   areas like the amygdala, hippocampus, and visual cortex, while
   deactivating the prefrontal cortex, which explains why dreams often
   feel illogical (3). These neural patterns support theories that dreams
   help process emotions, consolidate memory, and simulate real-life
   scenarios. REM sleep also supports neuroplasticity, as it can
   strengthen and organize neural connections tied to learning and memory.

   To activate REM sleep, one needs to get sufficient sleep, which is 7-9
   hours per night,(4), and studies show that REM periods lengthen and
   intensify in the final sleep cycles (5). REM sleep has been linked to
   emotional regulation, creative insight, and next-day problem-solving
   (6;3).

Alternative function of dreaming

   Some researchers believe dreams serve practical functions beyond
   storytelling. The threat simulation theory suggests dreaming evolved to
   help us mentally rehearse danger in a safe, low-risk setting (15).

   Others argue dreams act as neural housekeeping, clearing out irrelevant
   memories to make space for more useful ones (16). While no single
   theory has been proven, most agree that dreaming reflects coordinated
   brain activity tied to memory, emotion, and adaptation.

What part of the brain controls dreams?

   Dreams aren’t driven by a single control center—they emerge from a
   network of brain regions working together. Research shows that the
   default mode network (DMN), a system linked to spontaneous thought and
   imagination, remains active during REM sleep and may help construct the
   narrative flow of dreams (9).

   The parietal lobes, which help the brain understand space and where
   things are, are thought to support the immersive, scene-like quality of
   dreams—like walking through a room or flying over a city (10). The
   temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), where the temporal and parietal lobes
   meet, has been linked to self-awareness during dreaming, and may play a
   key role in lucid dreaming, which is when someone realizes they’re
   dreaming while it’s happening (11).
   Despite advances in neuroscience, there’s still no single, proven
   theory that explains exactly why we dream or how dreams are generated
   in one definite way. Crazy, right?

Dreams & what’s happening in the brain

   Dreaming is such a fascinating topic because everyone dreams (even if
   you don’t remember them), but the experience of dreaming can vary from
   person to person. We do know that most dreams last about 5-20 minutes,
   and you can have multiple dreams in a night. The variability is in the
   experience of dreaming, recollection, and intensity (12).

   Some people remember their dreams vividly, and others do not. Some have
   the same dream over and over while others rarely repeat a dream. Some
   remember only a handful of dreams in their lifetime but others can
   recall dreams nightly. Some are lucid dreamers, and most of us are not.
   Others dream in color, while some dream in black and white (13).

Muse’s EEG Spectogram image above shows the intensity of brainwave activity
over time. High-intensity regions are indicated by tones of red, yellow,
green, and low-intensity regions are indicated by tones of blue.

   Up until the advent of the electroencephalogram (EEG), researchers were
   unable to access or measure electrical activity that occurs in the
   brain during all states of consciousness. It was once assumed that the
   brain simply “shut off” at night—but we now know that’s far from true.
   In fact there are varying levels of brain activity that occur during
   different stages of sleep. As we cycle through different sleep stages,
   the brain shifts between distinct brainwave frequencies like alpha,
   theta, delta, and beta—each linked to different levels of awareness,
   rest, and recovery.

A deeper look: dreams in REM

   You can dream in any stage, but most dreaming appears to occur during
   the REM stage. During REM sleep, brain activity most closely resembles
   that of a wakeful state (14). People also tend to remember most of
   their dreams in a REM state, compared to other states, and after REM
   sleep, i.e. a restful, nourishing night of sleep, cognitive function
   improves. This is something you can measure with the Muse headband.

   Interestingly, a study conducted by J. Allan Hobson at the Division of
   Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School proposed that “REM sleep
   dreaming can be viewed as a virtual reality created from our brain’s
   devise.” In other words, “we sense, we act and we feel” what we dream
   (15). The theory inspired a team of sleep engineers at MIT’s Sleep &
   Neurophysiology Lab to investigate if receiving sensory stimuli while
   sleeping could shape our dreams.

dreams, meditation, sleep Muse’s sleep stages graph (hypnogram) above shows
the different stages of sleep of participants during their session.


   To do this, they recorded a group of participant’s body and brainwave
   patterns while sleeping and computed their sleep stages and sleep
   scores using Muse. While asleep, participants underwent sensory dream
   engineering techniques using Dormio, the first interactive interface
   for sleep. These techniques include; receiving a burst of scent or
   placing a heated eye mask over their eyes (16). So, what did the study
   uncover?
    1. Ameliorated Dream Valence – After introducing pleasurable or
       familiar scents and temperatures, participants showed positive
       affective responses (17) while dreaming that are associated with
       patterns of respiration, heart rate, and muscular activity
       (particularly during REM sleep), improved sleep quality, and mood.
    2. Alleviated Nightmares – Participants showed fewer biomarkers
       associated with nightmares, such as increased and elevated heart
       rate, increased eye movements, increased respiration rate, and the
       interference of REM sleep.

   When you dream, your whole brain is active at some level. However,
   during REM sleep, your prefrontal cortex is less active. This is the
   part of the brain that is responsible for planning and logic. Since
   activity in the prefrontal cortex is lower during REM sleep, we often
   don’t recognize the strangeness or implausibility of a dream until we
   wake up (2). This is why your ability to fly or the appearance of
   monsters seems so realistic until you wake up from that dream (or
   nightmare).

Modern theories on dreams

   While the science behind sleep and sleep tracking continues to evolve,
   some modern theories suggest that dreams may not carry deep symbolic
   meaning at all. Instead, they may be the brain’s way of stitching
   together fragments of recent memories, thoughts, or emotional
   residue—often from the things we’ve been thinking about most.

   Still, other researchers argue that dreaming serves a deeper
   function—one that plays a vital role in cognitive health and emotional
   resilience. As we better understand the relationship between sleep and
   mental fitness, tools like Muse allow us to track brain activity in
   real time, revealing how quality sleep can impact focus, stress, and
   recovery.

   Here are three leading theories on why we dream:

1. Memory Consolidation

   Sleep is essential for memory formation. Without enough rest, the brain
   struggles to retain and recall information. Some researchers believe
   that REM sleep—and the dreaming that occurs during it—helps sort,
   store, or even discard memories. In this view, dreaming is like a
   nightly cleanup: clearing space for more relevant information to take
   hold (1).

2. Evolutionary Purpose

   Because dreaming is present in other mammals, some believe it serves an
   evolutionary function. One theory suggests dreams allow us to mentally
   rehearse difficult or threatening situations, helping us become more
   adaptive in waking life. Others propose that dreaming supports
   problem-solving in a safe, altered state—essentially a sandbox for the
   subconscious (2).

3. Emotional Processing

   REM sleep may play a vital role in helping the brain regulate emotions.
   A  study from the Sleep and Neuroimaging Laboratory at Berkeley found
   that during REM sleep, the limbic system—which processes fear and
   emotion—becomes highly active while also working to block negative
   emotions such as fear and anger (18). This process may help reset
   emotional sensitivity, which explains why people who get less REM sleep
   (and therefore dream less) often show more difficulty managing emotions
   in their waking hours.

   So while the exact purpose of dreaming isn’t fully proven, the evidence
   suggests it may serve multiple roles across memory, survival, and
   emotional balance—all essential components of mental fitness.

   Even though we may not fully understand why we dream, or how the brain
   pulls it off so vividly, what we do know is this: dreams aren’t just
   stories we sleep through. They’re a sign that the brain is working,
   adapting, and healing in the background. And thanks to tools like Muse
   and digital sleeping pills, we don’t have to leave that mystery
   entirely in the dark.

   Start tracking today, and start improving your mental fitness by
   starting with your sleep!

Frequently asked questions about dreams & the brain

   What happens in the brain when we dream?

   When we dream, especially during REM sleep, brain activity increases in
   regions like the amygdala (emotion), hippocampus (memory), and visual
   cortex (imagery), while the prefrontal cortex (logic) quiets down. This
   combination allows dreams to be vivid, emotional, and often surreal.

   What part of the brain controls dreaming?

   Dreams are shaped by a network of brain regions, including the default
   mode network (DMN), parietal lobes (spatial awareness), and the
   temporo-parietal junction (linked to self-awareness and lucid
   dreaming). There is no single "dream center."

   How long do dreams last?

   Most dreams last between 5 to 20 minutes, and you can have several
   dreams throughout the night, especially during longer REM sleep cycles
   in the second half of your sleep.

   Can you control your dreams?

   Yes—this is called lucid dreaming. It happens when the dreamer becomes
   aware they’re dreaming and may even influence the dream’s direction.
   Lucid dreaming is often linked to activity in the temporo-parietal
   junction (TPJ).

   Why don’t we remember our dreams?

   You’re more likely to remember a dream if you wake up during or right
   after REM sleep. Low activity in the prefrontal cortex during REM may
   also limit the brain’s ability to encode dream content into long-term
   memory.

   Does dreaming serve a purpose?

   While still debated, current research suggests dreaming may support
   emotional regulation, memory consolidation, and problem-solving. Some
   scientists also believe it helps the brain "reset" emotional responses
   after stressful experiences.
