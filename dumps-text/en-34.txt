   Have you ever woken up from a dream about a neighbor or a cousin or the
   barista at your local coffee shop, confused and disoriented and
   wondering what the hell that was all about? Most of us have. Even a
   dream about someone you’d expect to dream about, like an ex or a
   parent, might not make much sense at first.

   If you’re finding yourself stumped and can’t get it out of your mind, a
   dream-interpretation practice might help. First, it’s important to know
   that there are countless traditions, and variations on traditions,
   related to understanding our dreams.

   The Indigenous Guarani culture, for example, has a long history of
   dream-centric spirituality. According to Amanda Takwapu, a spiritual
   practitioner and apprentice to the Tupi-Guarani traditions, specific
   cosmovisions — ways of approaching and understanding dreamwork — might
   even vary from tribe to tribe. What doesn’t change in Guarani practice
   is that it’s not viewed as interpretation, exactly. The experience of
   trying to understand a dream is instead seen as a conversation between
   the dream, the person who experienced it, and anyone they’re talking to
   about it. “This is something that we dialogue with when we’re sleeping
   and when we’re awake during the day,” she explains. “It’s a territory
   that’s consciously alive with us.”
   For Alex Shiflett, a licensed mental-health clinician and dream doula,
   their practice is influenced by the psychoanalytic methods of Freud and
   Jung as well as various spiritual dream-interpretation methods and the
   use of dreams in creative practices. “My practice is rooted in the
   philosophy that everyone in the dream is you; this is also related to
   the concept of everything and everyone being connected,” they explain.

   It’s okay if you’re unsure which type of dreamwork practice makes the
   most sense for you — try a few and see what resonates. (Just make sure
   you’re being respectful and non-appropriative; in the case of Guarani
   dreamwork, Takwapu says expanding access to traditional knowledge is
   one of her goals, but this may not be true for all Indigenous
   practices.) When a certain method feels right or makes sense to you,
   you’ll know. A good first step is to focus on remembering and thinking
   about your dreams, whether that’s through a dream journal or good
   old-fashioned conversation. Shiflett recommends using a voice-recording
   app to describe your dream as soon as you wake up — more on that below
   — while Takwapu says conversations are best.

   We spoke to Takwapu and Shiflett as well as Autumn Fourkiller,
   Indigenous mystic and writer behind the Dream Interpretation for
   Dummies newsletter, and Lauri Quinn Loewenberg, professional dream
   analyst and author, about how to interpret the people and scenarios we
   envision in our dreams the most. Whether it’s an ex, a parent, a
   co-worker, or even a celebrity, keep reading to find out why, for
   better or for worse, we can’t seem to get them out of our heads.

.
If you want to start working with your dreams …

   For Takwapu, remembering and discussing dreams is second nature; it’s
   something she has practiced since childhood. “Ever since you’re able to
   start talking, you’re sharing your dreams with your mother or aunties —
   usually a matriarch of your village or of your clan,” she says. “For
   anybody who didn’t have that privilege growing up, of being able to
   share their dreams, articulating is going to be the strongest thing
   that you can do.” While Takwapu appreciates dream journals as a way of
   understanding broader trends in your dreaming life and uses one
   herself, she believes that speaking out loud about your dreams, with
   someone else there to hear about them, is the best way to enter into a
   dialogue with them. “When we’re dreaming, we’re not vocally dialoguing
   with anybody,” Takwapu says. “So then the second part is, in the waking
   life, embodying it by feeling it and articulating it. This is going to
   strengthen your ability to bring back that wisdom into this material
   realm.”

   Shiflett agrees that any attempt to understand your dream is best done
   in conversation. “Because dreams show us our blind spots, it is best to
   do this practice with someone who works with dreams,” they say. “You
   might not ‘see’ something until another person facilitates or reflects
   it back to you.” But if you don’t have anyone to speak to, another
   option Shiflett recommends is to use a voice recorder as soon as you
   wake up, allowing you to stay close to the dream. They advise telling
   it as you remember it, without overthinking or self-editing, and from
   the first person. It’s important to take note of details, from the
   colors you saw to the narrative thread the dream followed. Most
   important, says Shiflett, is to notice what feelings are coming up when
   you think about the dream or particular images in it — what
   associations are you making, and how does it feel in your body?

   In Guarani tradition, how a dream makes you feel matters more than
   anything else. “For us, it’s less about identifying objects, places,
   things in our dreams, but it’s very important for us to remember how we
   feel,”  Takwapu says. “That’s going to be an indicator either to the
   elders or to our family members of what that dream could signify.” But
   what if you can’t remember your dreams at all? According to Shiflett,
   there are methods you can try that will help to jog your memory. “If
   you struggle remembering your dreams, tell yourself every night before
   bed that you will remember your dreams,” they suggest. “Keep practicing
   writing down even your first thought upon waking. Remembering your
   dreams is like remembering where you put your keys — not remembering
   something from the past but where you put something.”

.
If you want to know why you dreamed about someone specific …

   “When you dream about someone, you are having subjective and objective
   experiences of this person,” says Shiflett. “Sometimes we dream about
   someone but they’re nothing like how they are in waking life. So
   there’s a part of yourself that you’ve projected onto an image of this
   person; this person is the chosen image because of personal
   associations with the person.” For them, interpreting the dream starts
   with considering your own associations — memories, feelings, thoughts —
   with that particular person. From there, you can figure out the story
   that’s being told: “Dream interpretation is a practice in tuning in
   with what we know.” Since, in Shiflett’s practice, everyone in the
   dream is you, you can try putting yourself back in the dream as the
   person you dreamed about. “If you dream of someone, it means you’re
   noticing them, or something about them, within yourself.” Shiflett also
   says it’s important to consider larger patterns and the role the person
   plays in your life and in your dreams more broadly.

   For Takwapu, it’s just another example of how important it is to
   connect with how you felt during the dream. “Did you feel safe with
   this person? Did you feel hesitancy around this person in the dream?
   Was this person coming toward you? Were they going away from you?” she
   asks. All of these emotional elements are helpful signals in
   understanding the dream’s message.

.
If you’re curious about the connections between dreaming and spirituality …

   For some dream analysts, working with dreams is simply a psychological
   practice based entirely on the dreamer’s inner workings and psyche. But
   in many traditions, dreamwork is a spiritual practice. For Shiflett,
   it’s a bit of both; they believe that every aspect of a dream comes
   from the self, but they also believe that a person’s internal world
   contains a channel to the divine. “We just have to create practices and
   rituals to tune in to the frequency,” they say. “Dreams can be part of
   that practice and ritual.”

   Takwapu says that for the Guarani, there is no real separation between
   our dreams and the spiritual realm. That can be understood even from
   the Guarani word for dream, Aetxara’u. The prefix, Aetxa, means “to see
   beyond this material realm/plane.” Dreams aren’t just a channel to the
   spiritual; they themselves take place in a spiritual realm. She uses
   the metaphor that, for her, the spirit realm exists in the same way the
   city of London does: She’s not there right now, but she knows it exists
   and is full of movement and life. “The spirits, the energies and the
   entities that some folks outside of an Indigenous culture might see as
   a separate realm — for us, we view it and we dialogue with it,” she
   says. “And we have a relation to it in our waking world and the dream
   space and our afterlife. So it’s something that’s continually existing,
   and it’s not a separate realm.”

.
If you’re dreaming about someone repeatedly …

   A one-off dream about another person is one thing. But when it becomes
   a repeated pattern, that can be especially significant. To work with
   repeating dreams about someone specific, Takwapu recommends first
   thinking about how the person you’re dreaming about is related to you
   in waking life — your current interactions with them or even the lack
   thereof. “If they’re repeatedly coming to you in dreams, that’s
   definitely significant subconsciously or spiritually,” she says. Then,
   when discussing how that person is represented in your dreams and in
   your waking life, consider how it feels just to talk about it without
   them present. If you feel the need to include them in the conversation
   or talk to them about what’s happening in your dreams, Takwapu says
   that’s an indicator of spiritual significance. “There might be a
   dialogue that you guys are meant to have, and maybe this dream is going
   to be opening up that conversation for you,” she says. “It’s definitely
   something to discuss with a trusted person that guides you in your
   dreams, or also reach out to that person if it’s safe to do so.”

   Shiflett says that our dreams often involve repeated themes and
   coincidences for us to uncover. “​​There are synchronicities when
   dreaming of others that we might not know the whole meaning of until
   hindsight,” they explain. “Notice how often you might dream of a
   certain person. Does this person in your dream always play the same
   role? Do they come up after certain events in waking life? What is the
   larger pattern?”

.
If you dream about a stranger …

   Some of the most confusing dreams are the ones in which the subject is
   a person we don’t recognize from our waking life. Takwapu cautions
   against automatically thinking of them as a “stranger.” “This could be
   a premonition, a spirit, an embodiment that’s waiting for you,” she
   says. “And we’re already identifying it as a stranger. Our words hold
   power; imagine this energy trying to come through to us, and we’re
   like, This is a stranger. It’s really important — if you aren’t
   familiar with the people that you’re dreaming about — to not
   immediately classify it as a stranger.”

   Shiflett says that in their practice, dreams about unfamiliar people
   can be related to the Jungian archetypes found in dreams: the self, the
   shadow, the anima/animus, and the persona. “Explore what this character
   was doing, their role in the dream, and potentially other associations
   with the person,” they suggest.

.
If you have a nightmare about someone …

   So does the tone of the dream matter as much as who was in it? Takwapu
   says it does, but she also explains that in the Guarani cosmovision,
   there’s no such thing as a nightmare — the label itself is a box in
   which we tend to toss any unpleasant feelings that might’ve come up
   during a dream without closely inspecting them. Instead of doing that,
   she recommends getting curious about the feelings that came up — did
   you feel unsafe? Did you feel a loss of control? Did you feel shame or
   embarrassment? You can then investigate further into why that feeling
   makes you scared or uncomfortable: “When we start dismantling this idea
   that some dreams are good dreams or nightmares, that’s where shadow
   work comes in.”

   The feelings a dream brought up can still be spiritually significant.
   Here, Takwapu references the Guarani word Djapytsaká, which she
   describes as a sense of spiritual caution or discernment. Consistently
   practicing that discernment, and deepening your awareness of the dream
   realm, can help you develop a stronger sense of when a dream has a
   message to share. “It could signify that you should reach out to them,
   or maybe it’s reminding you to share that dream with them,” she says.
   “A lot of the time, we believe when we share our dreams with other
   people, it has more to do with the person we’re choosing to share it
   with. There might be a message for them that they need to hear, even if
   we didn’t dream about them directly.”

.
If you dream about your ex …

   “The most common ex that we tend to dream about is our first love. In
   fact, we’ll dream about that person even 50 years since we’ve been with
   them,” says Loewenberg. The reason why that particular ex tends to keep
   showing up in our dreams is that they symbolize what first love feels
   like — passion, excitement, always wanting to be together, being
   desired, and all those magical feelings. So the first love will show up
   whenever our current relationship gets a little routine and humdrum and
   we need to spice it up and bring back those feelings. They can also
   show up when we’re in a dry spell and we haven’t been in a relationship
   for a while.”

   According to Fourkiller, ex dreams are all about the past. “Not to get
   too deep in the weeds here, but I’m a young millennial with young
   millennial friends, and that means I have been asked about dreaming
   about an ex too many times to count,” says Fourkiller. “My rule of
   thumb is that it almost never means you should get back with said ex,
   especially if it was a horrible terrible relationship that I was always
   very happy to commiserate about the first time around but that, if you
   ignore my dream advice, I will probably not be as happy to again. Ex
   dreams are simply about the past, about what we’ve left there. About
   the parts (not persons) that may be salvageable from it. About showing
   grace to ourselves.” Takwapu says that the relationship you currently
   have with your ex is a relevant factor. “Maybe it’s somebody that is no
   contact, but they’re still finding you in the dream realm, and that’s a
   whole different spiritual conversation to have,” she says. “It has to
   do with your protection, your safety, in both the dream realm and the
   waking world.” If you can’t or don’t want to speak to the ex you’re
   dreaming about, that in itself can be an indicator of what the dream
   signifies. If you could see yourself talking to your ex about the
   dream, maybe that means there is a conversation you need to have with
   them. But if you can’t, it could just mean they’re the one trying to
   connect with you. “There could be some things that have been
   unprocessed. There could be emotional things or even spiritual ties
   that are asking to be let go of,” she says.

.
If you dream about your mother …

   “Ah, the mother. Part of the triplicate of the maiden, mother, and
   crone. When it comes to dreams with archetypes, sometimes the most
   obvious answer is the most true,” says Fourkiller. “They follow Occam’s
   Razor in that respect. So when dreaming of a mother (or your mother) we
   must think about the traditional elements associated with motherhood,
   like nurturing, and ask ourselves if we are neglecting to nurture
   ourselves, a relationship, a dream, etc. If dreaming about your mother
   specifically, that could mean that it is time to interrogate that
   relationship, what it has left you with, and what it is doing to you
   now. Sorry.”

   According to Loewenberg, dreams about mothers are more common than
   those about fathers. “We tend to dream about the mother more than the
   father figure. In fact, on average, we tend to dream of our mothers or
   a mother figure about once a week. It’s important to remember, though,
   especially when you’re figuring out what the different people in your
   dream mean, that all figures actually represent a part of yourself. The
   dreaming mind will show us the different bits of our personality in the
   form of a person. So, that being said, if you’re a mother and you dream
   about your mother or a mother figure, that’s going to represent your
   role as mom. Pay attention to how she is in the dream. Is she helpful?
   Is she ill? Is she dying? Is she in trouble? However she is portrayed
   in the dream is a reflection of how you are seeing yourself as a mom.”

   Loewenberg adds: “If you’re not a mother, then go ahead and look at
   your current relationship with your mom. If there’s no issue there,
   then she will represent the part of you that is nurturing, takes care
   of yourself, and is nurturing to others around you.”

.
If you dream about your co-workers …

   “If it’s a co-worker you deal with on a daily basis — someone you work
   closely with — then they probably will be playing themselves,” says
   Loewenberg. “And so whatever is going on in the dream will reflect
   whatever is going on between you and the co-worker in real life.”

   But how about a co-worker you don’t interact with often? Loewenberg
   says the following: “They’re going to represent some part of yourself.
   So ask yourself — and this is a rule that you want to apply with every
   person that shows up in your dream — what stands out to you about this
   co-worker? What is their outstanding quality? What is the first thing
   you think of when you think about this co-worker? Maybe the co-worker
   you’re dreaming about is a tech expert and is really good at fixing
   computers if something goes wrong. Apply that quality to yourself. Do
   you need to take on that quality just for your job or in general? Do
   you feel that you need to be more of a get-it-done-and-fix-it kind of
   person?”

   While Fourkiller agrees that the dream about your co-worker “could
   definitely be a reflection of what is happening” in your real waking
   life, she adds that “work dreams always signify to me a rootedness
   there, in the realm of work. I totally understand this. Capitalism is
   rough. I think these kind of dreams can present a message that, ‘Hey,
   there is work that needs to be done elsewhere.’ Usually you’ll be able
   to tell. If the co-worker is berating you, it is time to take a step
   back. If you and the co-worker are in happy collaboration, despite not
   having worked together before, it is probably a good sign and there is
   excavating to be done.”

.
If you dream about a significant other …

   “Pay really close attention to their behavior and their condition in
   the dream,” instructs Loewenberg. For example, a really common dream
   we’ll have surrounding our significant other is that we can’t find them
   … That can indicate one of two things. It could mean that you miss them
   and that you’re not spending enough time with them, because maybe
   they’re always working or maybe it’s a long-distance relationship. The
   other thing it can mean is that you’re looking for a way to better
   connect — remember that couples can live together yet have no
   connection anymore.”

   Fourkiller also urges you to home in on the details of your dream. “It
   depends on the dream, the emotions behind it, but a significant other
   dream can be a happy thing, an ‘I’m so in love with the person’ thing,
   or a message that says you need to pay less attention to this person
   and more attention to what is going on in your own life and heart.”

   “It’s very important to think about how you felt in the dream, how you
   felt about your interaction with them in the dream, and how you feel in
   your waking life about them,” says Takwapu. “When you’re able to
   identify how you feel in this dream, it’s going to be able to give you
   a way to navigate the relationship.”

.
If you dream about your significant other cheating …

   “First, has there been infidelity in this relationship? If yes, that
   just shows that there’s still distrust,” says Loewenberg. “But if this
   dream seems to be coming out of left field and you have no reason at
   all to suspect them, the dream doesn’t mean that they are cheating. It
   can mean that you feel that there is a third wheel in the relationship,
   like work or golf or a new baby — something that is causing you to feel
   cheated out of your time and attention with the significant other.”

   Fourkiller also points to previous cheating as an important factor.
   “Don’t jump to conclusions! Just like a death dream, this doesn’t mean
   that they are cheating. Unless they have before. Then they might be,”
   she says. “If they haven’t, though, think about the material reality of
   the relationship. Have you been spending enough time together? What is
   lacking here? Am I being supported? Am I supporting? All that.”

.
If you dream about your significant other dying …

   “Don’t look at that literally! Dreams are symbolic,” Loewenberg
   reassures. If you look at it literally, you’re going to freak yourself
   out. In a dream, death represents something ending or changing. So, is
   there some kind of big change going on in your relationship? Are you
   reaching a new level? Did you suddenly get engaged? Or is your
   significant other changing in some way? Have they lost a lot of weight?
   Did they get a promotion, and now there’s not enough time with each
   other and that relationship is changing in that respect? Assess things
   with that kind of approach.” Fourkiller agrees that a shift is on the
   horizon. “This relationship is about to evolve, big time. It does not
   mean that they are about to keel over.”

.
If you dream about someone who has already died …

   For this one, Fourkiller says the interpretation depends on your
   personal beliefs. “I am someone who believes the dead can visit us,
   that they can give us messages or just drop by. If you’re not, though,
   think about what messages (though perhaps not literal) your brain is
   trying to bring you by presenting this person to you. Is it a message
   of grief? Of love? Of warning?”

   “If you dream of someone who has died, they will likely represent a
   personality trait that you both share,” Loewenberg adds. “Or they can
   represent who you were when they were alive and in your life. For
   example, if you have a childhood friend who has passed away and you
   dream of them, they could represent who you were back when you were
   friends and they were alive.”

.
If you dream about someone famous …

   “Celebrities are really fun to dream about! One of the most common
   dreams of a celebrity is that you’re friends with them and you’re
   hanging out with them,” says Loewenberg. “It can be a celebrity you
   really like or it can be someone who seems random … Regardless, the
   celebrity is going to represent some part of yourself that, like a
   celebrity, you feel deserves recognition and perhaps even applause. Ask
   yourself what the celebrity is best known for. Is it a song? Look at
   the title or the lyrics of that song because chances are there will be
   something relevant to your life in either the title or lyrics. If the
   celebrity is an actor, are they best known for a TV show or a movie?
   Then ask yourself if something is relevant to you in the title of that
   show or movie, in the story line, or, perhaps, in the character they
   play — maybe you relate to that.”

   Unless you recently watched something with that particular celebrity,
   Fourkiller says this dream may actually be about your own desire for
   recognition. “Did you watch a movie with them in it? If not, let’s talk
   about recognition and celebration. There is a part of you that deserves
   to be recognized and celebrated, and it’s probably not being recognized
   or celebrated,” she says. “Can you identify that part? Can you see it?”

.
On the celebs who appear in dreams most often:

   “I remember there was a time when Oprah was the most dreamt of
   celebrity … but I would say that, overall, in all the years I’ve been
   doing this, it would probably be the president at the time that I get
   asked about the most,” says Loewenberg. For Fourkiller? “Not gonna lie,
   it’s Nic Cage. Maybe I’m just friends with a bunch of Nic Cage
   superfans, but he comes up more often than you think. My subscribers
   and clients are much less likely to submit a dream for interpretation
   that has to do with celebrities, though perhaps that’s because they
   think it is less worthy of interpretation.”

   The takeaway: Fourkiller notes that even the silly dream you deem
   unworthy of interpretation still has significance. “Not every dream
   necessarily has a meaning, but all dreams are important. Even if
   they’re silly. Even if they’re scary. And so on,” she says. “Knowing
   whether a dream is worth interpreting is up to the dreamer themself,
   and it is something that only comes with time. I cannot decide for you
   what is important, I can only guide you into (hopefully) a deeper
   self-knowledge, one that you will use to add weight and importance to
   your own experience, which will in turn let you value your mind, your
   thoughts, and yes, always, your dreams.”

   In general, Fourkiller says dream interpretation can be an incredibly
   subjective practice. “My interpretations are rooted in both a personal
   spiritual practice, and, if we’re getting technical, probably a
   Jungian-inspired one, too. So with that in mind, your interpretation
   might be different than one I might come up with, but that doesn’t make
   it less true,” she says. “My rule of thumb here is to not disregard
   obvious conclusions, but to never settle on a final interpretation
   until everything has been sorted through. Make sure to pay attention to
   themes, emotions, archetypes, etc. This will help you dig deeper,
   reflect, and not lean on surface-level analysis.”
