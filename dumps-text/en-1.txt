   Zane Alsaroori, who grew up on a council estate and lost his brother to
   knife crime, is now a film and television intern

   A film and television intern who grew up on a council estate and lost
   his brother to knife crime has said he wants to inspire people from
   similar backgrounds to "fight for their dreams".

   Zane Alsaroori, 22, grew up on the Wensley estate in Page Hall,
   Sheffield, and started working with Yorkshire-based film production
   company Warp Films earlier this year.

   The company, which made hit TV show Adolescence and thriller series
   Reunion, has launched a new paid internship scheme for people from
   South Yorkshire, which the firm said would "break down barriers" to
   getting into the industry.

   Mr Alsaroori said: "Coming from nothing sometimes gives you the biggest
   push to get everything you want."

   He said his interest in working in the television and film industry
   began when he watched EastEnders with his mother as a child, but he
   added that most of his teachers had "laughed at the idea".

   "A big cloud is over people like me from a council estate and that
   forces other people not to believe in you," he said.

   "It's nobody's fault, people who doubted me in the past had similar
   dreams deep inside, and sometimes they're saying it out of love and
   concern for your future."

   Zane's brother, Sami Alsaroori, was killed in a knife attack in 2017

   Zane was 14 when his brother, Sami Alsaroori, was killed in a knife
   attack aged 31 in 2017.

   "Before he passed, he saw my show reel and was excited to see my
   future, and I didn't want to let that dream die - it kept pushing me,"
   Mr Alsaroori said.

   "I asked if my brother can go so young, why am I living my life for
   others and thinking I can't make it? If I want to make it, I'll make
   it."

   He said he now wanted to encourage other people from similar
   backgrounds not to give up if they dreamed of working in creative
   industries.

   "In my community, people sometimes don't have that faith in themselves
   - but we're not stuck," he said.

   "People going down the wrong paths, a lot of the time, it's from the
   people around you giving you no escape.

   "All this crime takes place because you've got all these lost dreams
   and these creative minds dying, not able to see the light."

   Warp Films has launched the new internship in association with Screen
   Yorkshire and supported by Netflix.

   Niall Shamma, CEO of Warp Films, said: "Growing up in Sheffield and
   going to a comprehensive school, I wasn't aware of the opportunities
   that existed in the film and TV industry, and the position I hold today
   is very much down to a chance meeting along the way.

   "We want to change that and give local people the belief that this
   industry is open to them, and also provide them with a meaningful
   opportunity in the sector."

   Applications open in December exclusively to people living in South
   Yorkshire.

   Mr Alsaroori added there were more opportunities to get into the
   industry than people may realise.

   "There's so much support now, it may have been a different world a few
   years ago, but it's developing faster and faster," he said.

   "You won't be able to see that if you let the negativity eat you up,
   but if you use it as your motivator, you'll see that there is a chance
   and it's so much closer than you think.

   "You don't have to go to London, it can happen right here."
