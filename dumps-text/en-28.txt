Why Your Brain Needs to Dream

   Research shows that dreaming is not just a byproduct of sleep, but
   serves its own important functions in our well-being.
   By Matthew Walker | October 24, 2017

   We often hear stories of people who’ve learned from their dreams or
   been inspired by them. Think of Paul McCartney’s story of how his hit
   song “Yesterday” came to him in a dream or of Mendeleev’s
   dream-inspired construction of the periodic table of elements.

   But, while many of us may feel that our dreams have special meaning or
   a useful purpose, science has been more skeptical of that claim.
   Instead of being harbingers of creativity or some kind of message from
   our unconscious, some scientists have considered dreaming to be an
   unintended consequence of sleep—a byproduct of evolution without
   benefit.

   Sleep itself is a different story. Scientists have known for a while
   now that shorter sleep is tied to dangerous diseases, like heart
   disease and stroke. There is mounting evidence that sleep deprivation
   leads to a higher risk of obesity and Alzheimer’s disease. Large
   population studies reflect a saddening truth—the shorter your sleep,
   the shorter your life. Not only that, sleep helps us to hold onto our
   memories and to learn facts and skills faster, making it important for
   everyone including infants, students, athletes, pilots, and doctors.

   Much of this I outline in my new book, Why We Sleep: Unlocking the
   Power of Sleep and Dreams, which summarizes the many findings we have
   about sleep and its function in our lives.

   But what about dreaming? Does it also have a purpose?

   Recent work in my neuroscience lab and the work of other scientists has
   shown that dreams may have a very particular function important to our
   well-being. Here are the two main ways dreams help us.

Dreaming is like overnight therapy

   It’s said that time heals all wounds, but my research suggests that
   time spent in dream sleep is what heals. REM-sleep dreaming appears to
   take the painful sting out of difficult, even traumatic, emotional
   episodes experienced during the day, offering emotional resolution when
   you awake the next morning.

   REM sleep is the only time when our brain is completely devoid of the
   anxiety-triggering molecule noradrenaline. At the same time, key
   emotional and memory-related structures of the brain are reactivated
   during REM sleep as we dream. This means that emotional memory
   reactivation is occurring in a brain free of a key stress chemical,
   which allows us to re-process upsetting memories in a safer, calmer
   environment.

       Learn why sleep is key to peak performance.

   How do we know this is so? In one study in my sleep center, healthy
   young adult participants were divided into two groups to watch a set of
   emotion-inducing images while inside an MRI scanner. Twelve hours
   later, they were shown the same emotional images—but for half the
   participants, the twelve hours were in the same day, while for the
   other half the twelve hours were separated by an evening of sleep.

   Those who slept in between the two sessions reported a significant
   decrease in how emotional they felt in response to seeing those images
   again, and their MRI scans showed a significant reduction in reactivity
   in the amygdala, the emotional center of the brain that creates painful
   feelings. Moreover, there was a reengagement of the rational prefrontal
   cortex of the brain after sleep that helped maintain a dampening
   influence on emotional reactivity. In contrast, those who remained
   awake across the day showed no such dissolving of emotional reactivity
   over time.

   That in itself doesn’t say anything about the role of dreaming. But we
   had recorded each participant’s sleep during the intervening night
   between the two test sessions, and we found that specific brain
   activity that reflected a drop in stress-related brain chemistry during
   the dream state determined the success of overnight therapy from one
   individual to the next.

   Dreaming has the potential to help people de-escalate emotional
   reactivity, probably because the emotional content of dreams is paired
   with a decrease in brain noradrenaline. Support for this idea came from
   a study done by Murray Raskind on vets with PTSD, who often suffer
   debilitating nightmares. When given the drug Prazosin—a medication that
   lowers blood pressure and also acts as a blocker of the brain stress
   chemical noradrenaline—the vets in his study had fewer nightmares and
   fewer PTSD symptoms than those given a placebo. Newer studies suggest
   this effect can be shown in children and adolescents with nightmares,
   as well, though the research on this is still in its infancy.

   The evidence points toward an important function of dreams: to help us
   take the sting out of our painful emotional experiences during the
   hours we are asleep, so that we can learn from them and carry on with
   our lives.

Dreaming enhances creativity and problem-solving

   It’s been shown that deep non-REM sleep strengthens individual
   memories. But REM sleep is when those memories can be fused and blended
   together in abstract and highly novel ways. During the dreaming state,
   your brain will cogitate vast swaths of acquired knowledge and then
   extract overarching rules and commonalties, creating a mindset that can
   help us divine solutions to previously impenetrable problems.

   How do we know dreaming and not just sleep is important to this
   process?

   In one study, we tested this by waking up participants during the
   night—during both non-REM sleep and dreaming sleep—and gave them very
   short tests: solving anagram puzzles, where you try to unscramble
   letters to form a word (e.g., OSEOG = GOOSE). First, participants were
   tested beforehand, just to familiarize them with the test. Then, we
   monitored their sleep and woke them up at different points of the night
   to perform the test. When woken during non-REM sleep, they were not
   particularly creative—they could solve very few puzzles. But, when we
   woke up participants during REM sleep, they were able to solve 15-35
   percent more puzzles than when they were awake. Not only that,
   participants woken while dreaming reported that the solution just
   “popped” into their heads, as if it were effortless.

   In another study, I and my colleagues taught participants a series of
   relational facts—such as, A>B, B>C, C>D, and so on—and tested their
   understanding by asking them questions (e.g., Is B>D or not?).
   Afterwards, we compared their performance on this test before and after
   a full night’s sleep, and also after they’d had a 60- to 90-minute nap
   that included REM sleep. Those who’d slept or had a long nap performed
   much better on this test than when they were awake, as if they’d put
   together disparate pieces of a jigsaw puzzle in their sleep.

   Some may consider this trivial, but it is one of the key operations
   differentiating your brain from your computer. It also underlies the
   difference between knowledge (retention of individual facts) and wisdom
   (knowing what they all mean when you fit them together). The latter
   seems to be the work of REM-sleep dreaming.

     “It’s said that time heals all wounds, but my research suggests that
     time spent in dream sleep is what heals”

   ―Dr. Matthew Walker

   Dreaming improves creative problem solving, too, according to another
   study. Participants learned to navigate a virtual maze using trial and
   error and aided by the placement of unique objects—like Christmas
   trees—at certain junctions in the maze. After this learning session,
   the group was split in two, with half napping and half watching a video
   for 90 minutes. Nappers were occasionally awoken to ask about the
   content of their dreams; those watching a video were also asked about
   thoughts going through their minds.

   Afterwards, the participants again tried to solve the maze, and those
   who napped were significantly better at it than those who didn’t, as
   expected. But the nappers who reported dreaming about the maze were 10
   times better at the task than those who napped and didn’t dream about
   the maze. There’s a reason you’ve never been told to stay awake on a
   problem.

   Looking at the content of these dreams, it was clear that the
   participants didn’t dream a precise replay of the learning experience
   while awake. Instead, they were cherry-picking salient fragments of the
   learning experience and attempting to place them within the catalog of
   preexisting knowledge. This is how dreaming helps us be more creative.

   While the benefits of dreaming are real, too many of us have problems
   getting a full eight hours of sleep and lose out on these advantages.
   Alternatively, we may think we’re the exception to the rule—that we’re
   one of those people who doesn’t happen to need a lot of sleep. But
   nothing could be further from the truth. Research clearly shows that
   people who overestimate their ability to get by on less sleep are sadly
   wrong.

Five ways to enhance your sleep

   book cover of This essay was adapted from Matthew Walker's new book,
   Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams (Scribner, 2017,
   368 pages).

   So how can we be sure to get enough sleep and experience a dream state?
   While we may be tempted to use sleeping pills to get to sleep, this has
   been shown to be detrimental to dreaming. Instead of taking pills, here
   are some simple ways to enhance your sleep:

   1. Make sure your room is dark and that you are not looking at bright
   light sources—i.e., computer screens and cell phones—in the last hour
   or two before going to bed. You may even want to start dimming lights
   in your house in the earlier parts of the evening, which helps to
   stimulate sleepiness.

   2. Go to bed and wake up at approximately the same time every day. This
   helps signal to your body a regular time for sleeping. It’s no use
   trying to sleep in a lot on weekends. There is no way to make up for
   regular sleep loss during the week.

   3. Keep the temperature in your house cool at night—maybe even cooler
   than you think it should be, like around 65 degrees. Your body
   temperature needs to drop at night for sleep, and a lower room
   temperature helps signal your brain that it’s time to sleep.

   4. If you have trouble falling asleep, or wake in the night feeling
   restless, don’t stay in bed awake. That trains the brain that your bed
   is not a place for sleeping. Instead, get up and read a book under dim
   light in a different room. Don’t look at your computer or cell phone.
   When sleepiness returns, then go back to bed. Or if you don’t want to
   get out of bed, try meditating. Studies suggest it helps individuals
   fall asleep faster, and also improves sleep quality.

   5. Don’t have caffeine late in the day or an alcohol-infused nightcap.
   Both of these interfere with sleep—either keeping you awake or
   stimulating frequent wake-ups during the night.

   Sleep is the single most effective thing we can do to rest our brain
   and physical health each day. Atop of sleep, dreaming provides
   essential emotional first aid and a unique form of informational
   alchemy. If we wish to be as healthy, happy, and creative as possible,
   these are facts well worth waking up to.
