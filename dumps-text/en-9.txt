'I turned charity shopping into my dream career'

   Jen Graham posts under the name Charity Shop Girl on social media

   Five years ago, Jen Graham was encouraged by her teenage daughter to
   share her favourite charity shop finds on social media.

   Pregnant with her younger daughter, the self-described second-hand
   fashion addict had just been made redundant from her job at a car
   dealership.

   Fast forward to the present day and Jen has nearly 200,000 followers
   across Instagram and TikTok and is currently filming for the BBC's new
   series Shift the Thrift.

   "Having something that was a hobby and being able to turn it into a
   career for a positive reason of helping these charities is really
   special," says the mother-of-three, who posts under the name Charity
   Shop Girl.

'Sharing styling tips'

   While Jen says she first fell in love with charity shops and the gems
   hidden within them when she was 17, her love of rummaging actually
   started much earlier.

   "My dad told me that when I was five or six years old he used to take
   me to the scrapyard where they sold clothes, bric-a-brac and bits of
   furniture," says Jen, who grew up in the Anfield area of Liverpool and
   now lives in Sandbach, Cheshire.

   "I used to love going there and I would buy the most random stuff.

   "I loved going there more than I loved going to a toy shop!"

   Encouraged by her elder daughter, Jen started sharing styling tips on
   social media.

   It was a move born out of necessity as well as passion, though, after
   she lost her job.

   "I was doing like one item three ways, and how I would wear this item
   and where I got it from and how much it was," she says.

   As her following began to grow, she started sharing the gems she had
   discovered while sifting through the rails at charity shops.

   "It just took off from there," says Jen.

   Her top discoveries include a YSL blazer for just £20, a Coach jacket
   for £30 and a Hermes purse for £25 as well as clothes from her
   favourite brands such as Jaeger and Frank Usher.

   Jen says it is important to shop out of season while charity shopping

   With her growing following came media opportunities including a styling
   segment on ITV's This Morning as well as becoming an ambassador for the
   The Air Ambulance Service and the National Children's Air Ambulance.

   But what top tips would she give to someone on the hunt for
   budget-friendly, sustainable fashion choices?

   "You've got to be prepared to go in for a rummage," she says.

   "You find one-off unique items - it's cheaper and the money is going
   back into the charity.

   "That's my main reason for charity shopping."
