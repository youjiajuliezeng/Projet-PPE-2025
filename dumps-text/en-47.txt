An American Dream at risk: What happens to a small Nebraska town when 3,200
workers lose their jobs

   LEXINGTON, Neb. – On a frigid day after Mass at St. Ann’s Catholic
   Church in rural Nebraska, worshippers shuffled into the basement and
   sat on folding chairs, their faces barely masking the fear gripping
   their town.

   A pall hung over the room just as it hung over the holiday season in
   Lexington, Nebraska.

   “Suddenly they tell us that there’s no more work. Your world closes in
   on you,” said Alejandra Gutierrez.

   She and the others work at Tyson Foods' beef plant and are among the
   3,200 people who will lose their jobs when Lexington's biggest employer
   closes the plant next month after more than two decades of operation.

   Hundreds of families may be forced to pack up and leave the town of
   11,000, heading east to Omaha or Iowa, or south to the meatpacking
   towns of Kansas or beyond, causing spinoff layoffs in Lexington's
   restaurants, barbershops, grocers, convenience stores and taco trucks.

   “Losing 3,000 jobs in a city of 10,000 to 12,000 people is as big a
   closing event as we’ve seen virtually for decades,” said Michael Hicks,
   director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Indiana's
   Ball State University. It will be “close to the poster child for hard
   times.”

   All told, the job losses are expected to reach 7,000, largely in
   Lexington and the surrounding counties, according to a report from the
   University of Nebraska, Lincoln, released Monday. Tyson employees alone
   will lose an estimated $241 million in pay and benefits annually.

   Tyson says it's closing the plant to “right-size” its beef business
   after a historically low cattle herd in the U.S. and the company’s
   expected loss of $600 million on beef production next fiscal year.

   The plant's closure threatens to unravel a Great Plains town where the
   American Dream was still attainable, where immigrants who didn't speak
   English and never graduated high school bought homes, raised children
   in a safe community and sent them to college.

   Now, those symbols of economic progress — mortgages and car payments,
   property taxes and tuition costs — are bills that thousands of Tyson
   workers won't have an income to pay.

   At St. Ann's church, Gutierrez sat between her daughters and recalled
   being told of the plant closure just before Thanksgiving while she
   visited a college campus with her high school senior, Kimberly.

   “At that moment, my daughter said she no longer wanted to study,”
   Gutierrez said. “Because where would we get the money to pay for
   college?”

   A tear slipped down Kimberly's cheek as she looked at her mother and
   then down at her hands.

   ‘Tyson was our motherland’

   If you threw a dart at a map of the United States, Lexington — called
   “Lex” by locals — would be just about bullseye.

   It's easy to miss driving down Interstate 80, half hidden by barren
   hackberry trees, corn fields and pastures of Black Angus cattle, but a
   driver can spy the plant's hulking industrial buildings pumping steam.

   The plant opened in 1990 and was bought by Tyson 11 years later,
   attracting thousands of workers and nearly doubling the town's
   population within a decade.

   Many came from Los Angeles, then stricken by recession, including
   Lizeth Yanes, who initially hated what she called “a little ghost
   town."

   But soon Lexington flourished, with suburbs sprouting among bur oak and
   American elm trees. The downtown, a strip of cobblestone streets and
   brick buildings, has a Somali grocer that abuts a Hispanic bakery;
   locals attend over a dozen churches and several city recreation
   centers.

   To this day, the plant creates the town's rhythm as workers roll on and
   off the daily A, B and C shifts and fill restaurants, school pickup
   lines and the one-screen movie theater showing “Polar Express.”

   “It took a long time for me to actually enjoy this little place,” said
   Yanes. “Now that I enjoy it, now I have to leave.”

   The atmosphere inside the Tyson plant, where workers process as many as
   5,000 head of cattle a day, laboring on slaughter floors, cleaning
   crews or trimming cuts of meat, feels “like a funeral,” she said.

   “Tyson was our motherland," said plant worker Arab Adan. The Kenyan
   immigrant sat in his car with his two energetic sons, who asked him a
   question he has no answer to: “Which state are we gonna go, daddy?”

   The only thing Adan is set on is that his kids finish the school year
   in Lexington, where school officials say nearly half of students have a
   parent working for Tyson.

   The school district, where at least 20 languages and dialects are
   spoken, has higher high school graduation and college attendance rates
   than the state and national average, and one of Nebraska's biggest
   marching bands. Residents are proud of the diversity and the tightknit
   community, where young people return to raise families.

   During Mass at St. Ann's, parishioners gave the cash in their pockets
   to a fund for families in financial need, despite knowing they'll be
   out of work next month. Afterward, Francisco Antonio ran through his
   future employment options with a sad smile.

   After the plant closes on Jan. 20, the 52-year-old father of four said
   he'll stay a few months in Lexington and look for work, though “now
   there's no future." He took off his glasses, paused, apologized and
   tried to explain his emotions.

   “It’s home mostly, not the job,” he said, replacing his glasses with an
   embarrassed smile.

   “We need another opportunity, job, here in Lex,” he said. “Otherwise
   Lex is gonna disappear.”

   ‘Tyson owes this community’

   The domino effect could go something like this: If 1,000 families skip
   town, said economist Hicks — who wouldn't be surprised if it were
   double that — seats would be left empty in schools, leading to teacher
   layoffs; there would be far fewer customers in restaurants, shops and
   other businesses.

   Most of the customers at Los Jalapenos, a Mexican restaurant down the
   street from the plant, are Tyson workers. They fill booths after work
   and are greeted by owner Armando Martinez’s mustachioed grin and bellow
   of “Hola, amigo!”

   Martinez’s grandson once told his grandfather that when he grows up he
   wants to work at Tyson. The child's fifth-grade sister recently
   gathered with classmates to talk about the changes happening with their
   parents. Some were headed to California, others to Kansas. All were in
   tears.

   If he can't keep up with bills, the restaurant will close, but “there’s
   just nowhere we can go," said Martinez, who undergoes dialysis for
   diabetes, has an amputated foot and prays for a miracle: that Tyson
   will change its mind.

   He knows it's unlikely. Asked by The Associated Press for comment about
   plans for the site, Tyson said in a statement that it “is currently
   assessing how we can repurpose the facility within our own production
   network.” It did not provide details, or say whether it plans to offer
   support to the community through the plant closure.

   Many, including City Manager Joe Pepplitsch, are hoping Tyson puts the
   plant up for sale and a new company comes in bringing jobs. That isn't
   a quick fix, requiring time, negotiations, renovations and no guarantee
   of comparable jobs.

   “Tyson owes this community a debt. I think they have a responsibility
   here to help ease some of the impact,” he said, noting Tyson doesn't
   pay city taxes due to a deal negotiated decades ago.

   ‘It’s not easy, at our age, to go back and start over’

   Near the plant, at the Dawson County Fairgrounds, Tyson workers
   recently filled a long hall as state agencies — responding with the
   urgency of a natural disaster — offered information on retraining,
   writing a resume, filing for unemployment and avoiding scammers when
   selling homes.

   Attendees' faces were subdued, like listening to a doctor’s prognosis.
   “Your financial health is going to change," they were told. “Don’t
   ignore the bank, they will not go away.”

   Many of the older workers don’t speak English, haven’t graduated high
   school and aren’t computer savvy. The last application some filled out
   was decades ago.

   “We know only working in meat for Tyson, we don’t have any other
   experience,” said Adan, the Kenyan immigrant.

   Back at St. Ann's, workers echoed that concern.

   “They only want young people now,” said Juventino Castro, who's worked
   at Tyson for a quarter-century. “I don’t know what’s going to happen in
   the time I have left.”

   Lupe Ceja said she's saved a little money, but it won’t last long. Luz
   Alvidrez has a cleaning gig that will sustain her for awhile. Others
   might return to Mexico for a time. Nobody has a clear plan.

   “It won’t be easy,” said Fernando Sanchez, a Tyson worker for 35 years
   who sat with his wife. “We started here from scratch and it’s time to
   start from scratch again."

   Tears rolled down his wife's cheeks and he squeezed her hand.
