   Grace Richardson is now the first openly gay Miss England, organisers
   said

   A woman who was bullied at school for being gay has said she has
   "achieved her dream" after being crowned Miss England.

   Grace Richardson said she suffered constant teasing due to her
   sexuality while at school in Leicestershire.

   The musical theatre student, from Leicester, said she was proud to have
   ignored the negativity, going on to win the prize after entering the
   competition for only the second time.

   She is now the first openly gay Miss England, after being crowned at an
   event in Wolverhampton on Friday.

   Miss Richardson, who will now represent England at Miss World 2026,
   said she was bullied "horrendously" while at school.

   She said: "So I was 15 when I came out. It was just after Covid and my
   peers at school just really weren't very nice to me, which definitely
   took a bit of a toll on my mental health.

   "I used to get picked on for countless things, being too skinny, being
   really short and then becoming really tall.

   "It's almost like everything I did was wrong.

   "So it's nice being able to stand up now and say, 'look at what I've
   done'.

   "I've ignored everything negative that they said to me and actually
   I've gone on to achieve my dreams."

   The 20-year-old was one of 12 women to qualify for the final round of
   the competition, having won the "talent" category.

   She was set to perform a ballet dance, but broke her foot the week
   after entering the event, and so used another of her musical theatre
   talents to impress the judges.

   Her rendition of Never Enough by Loren Allred, a song from The Greatest
   Showman, saw her take top prize.

   The Leicester College of Performing Arts student will now fly the
   England flag at Miss World, which is set to take place early next year
   in a location yet to be announced.

   She could become the first British winner of the competition since
   1983.

   "It would be absolutely incredible to be able to bring Miss World back
   to England, but you never know how it's going to go," she said.
