   Darcey Harry says her biggest goal for 2026 will be to join the LPGA
   Tour.

   The Welsh golfer enjoyed a successful debut season on the Ladies
   European Tour, claiming three top-10 finishes as well as a victory in
   the Hulencourt Women's Open in June.

   Her fine form saw her qualify for the Evian Championship and the AIG
   Women's Open at her home course of Royal Porthcawl, her first taste of
   the majors.

   Harry made the cut at Porthcawl, finishing tied for 40th place, a
   result she says capped "a phenomenal week".

   "It was a dream, it was an event I'd dreamed of playing in since I was
   little," said Harry.

   "If you'd told me this time last year that I'd be here right now I
   probably wouldn't have believed you."

   Harry's early successes this season saw her quickly revise her goals.

   "After a few events the goal was to try to keep my card on tour for the
   year and to have one top-10 finish," the 22-year-old said.

   "Seventy people on the tour keep their card and that's what I was going
   for - top 70, then it became top 20, top 15 and the chase for top 10.

   "I've got the confidence to know that I can go and have that top
   10-finish if I play well. It's been a really big learning curve this
   year."

   Darcey Harry reflects on her Hulencourt Open win

   Harry says her victory in Hulencourt, Belgium, was massive for her
   confidence.

   "It took a while to really sink in that I'd won and still now I can't
   believe it happened," she told BBC Sport Wales.

   "I play it in my head over and over again and try to get that feeling
   back as inspiration."

   She says it was "meant to be" as that victory ensured her place at her
   home course for the Women's Open.

   "It opened the door to play in two majors, which were certainly not on
   my list.

   "It's taught me to believe in myself and chase for another win and
   another and see how far I can take it."

   Harry finishes the 2025 season ranked fourth among rookies and 14th
   overall.

   "I showed myself that I do have the potential to play on the tour, with
   some of the world's best women, which has been great," she said.

   As for her goals for 2026, Harry's focus is clear.

   "I definitely want to win again on the LET Tour - that's everyone's
   dream - but the biggest goal for next year is to try to get out on the
   LGPA tour in America," she said.

   "If it doesn't happen next year it'll be the goal for the year after.

   "I'm going to really pick and choose the calendar quite wisely next
   year, and just enjoy being out there and see how far I can come with my
   game.

   "I've played a lot of events this year, the schedule has been hectic,
   so next year is going to be great to properly plan and get everything
   sorted."

   A move across the world could also be on the cards for the Dinas Powys
   native.

   "I'm thinking about going to Dubai now in January with my partner, so
   that's a new step in my career for sure," she added.

   "The facilities there are a golfer's dream and it's something that I
   need to do for my career to take the next step."
