In short:

   Adelaide man Zakary Weyer has turned a childhood dream into a reality
   by building his very own Jurassic Park Jeep.

   He joins a global community dedicated to recreating the vehicles that
   appeared in the 1993 blockbuster film.

   Mr Weyer says he frequently receives photo requests from strangers when
   he drives his replica.

   Zakary Weyer's obsession with Jurassic Park began before he was even
   born.

   "My parents actually went and saw it in the cinema when my mum was
   still pregnant with me. So I think that's probably where it started,"
   he said.

   When he grew up, he turned his childhood dream into a reality and built
   his very own Jurassic Park Jeep.

     "It's always been a dream of mine, since I was a kid, to have one of
     these,"

   he said.

   It took a while to find the right car, and while it is not perfectly
   accurate to the movie, he was still able to make it look as detailed as
   possible.

   "I've done a few different professions in my time and sort of picked up
   a lot of different skills that I needed," he said.

   "So welding and the metal bending and electrical work for the lighting
   and all that kind of stuff. [I] just picked it up over the years.

   "There's always some little thing you want to change or make better."

A T-rex sized hit

   Jurassic Park premiered in 1993 and quickly became the highest-grossing
   movie of all time, dethroned five years later by Titanic.

   For a generation of dinosaur-mad children it remains a cornerstone of
   pop culture, with six sequels and numerous books, TV shows and video
   games released in the three decades since.

   The dinosaurs are the stars of Jurassic Park, but vehicles play a major
   role in many of the film's iconic moments.

   There's the scene where Dr Alan Grant — played by Sam Neill — and Dr
   Ellie Sattler — played by Laura Dern — watch in awe from a Jeep as a
   Brachiosaurus walks past, or when a Tyrannosaurus rex breaks free and
   attacks the park's tour cars.

   Mr Weyer no longer uses his Jeep for the daily commute, but whenever he
   takes to Adelaide's roads he can expect the same reaction.

   "Every time I park somewhere basically I get people coming up asking
   for photos," he said.

   "One guy nearly actually crashed his bike getting a gander [as] he was
   going past."

Fandom finds a way

   There is a global community dedicated to recreating the cars from
   Jurassic Park.

   Byron Phillips is from the Australian branch of the Jurassic Park Motor
   Pool.

   Sanders)

   "We drive all around Australia ... doing events and charity work as
   well," he said.

   "It's all about making people smile at the end of the day. And creating
   those memories for people when they see the vehicle and they have a
   photo or they see it drive past.

   "For those few moments, you're really tapping into the fandom of
   whatever that car is, and whatever it belongs to."

   He loves the thrill of being spotted on the roads, but there is a
   deeper meaning behind the Jurassic Park tribute.

   "My son has a disability so a big part of the reason that I went with
   the Jurassic Jeep is because he can say 'Jeep' and 'dinosaur'," he
   said.

   "And so whenever I drive around town, he knows where I am. So it takes
   away the anxiety of 'where's Dad?'"

   Unlike Mr Weyer, Mr Phillips had zero mechanical knowledge when he
   first started putting his car together around a decade ago, so he was
   reliant on other members of the Motor Pool offering their advice.

   "There's an online resource and a group where they can compare notes
   and give guidance on certain parts of the Jeeps," he said.

   "It's always there. And people learn from each other. They learn from
   their mistakes. There's been many mistakes made."

From the road to the big screen

   Several cars from the Jurassic Park Motor Pool made it to the big
   screen in 2024, when amateur filmmakers in regional Victoria released a
   shot-for-shot low budget remake of the original film.

   John Roebuck, who directed Jurassic Park: Castlemaine Redux, said the
   production value from having Hollywood-accurate vehicles was immense.

   "It definitely felt like it was a level up in terms of production
   value," he said.

   "I think the cast and crew were used to me turning up to set with
   spray-painted Super Soakers or these very flimsily-made velociraptor
   pens that I'd spent weeks building that fell apart as soon as we
   finished shooting.

     "The day the cars turned up there really was an air of excitement.
     It felt like a level up."

   He even got to outrun a T-rex in one of the vehicles, in his on-screen
   role as game hunter Robert Muldoon.

   "We had the actors dressed up as Ellie Sattler and Ian Malcolm in the
   back of the Jeep and it felt a little bit like Jurassic Park virtual
   reality. It was a bizarre but exciting feeling," he said.

'Not as hard as you think'

   Zakary Weyer said building the Jeep had been a "life changer".

   It was also a lot cheaper than he expected, costing around $10,000 for
   the Jeep, and a further $2,000 on the Jurassic Park fit-out.

   Whether it's a Jurassic Park Jeep, a Back To The Future DeLorean, or a
   Batmobile, he has a simple message to anyone wanting to recreate their
   favourite movie vehicle.

   "Just do it. It's actually not as hard as you think once you get
   started," he said.

   "It's always just taking that first small step like getting a set of
   wheels, painting them. That's a pretty simple one.

     "And then from there, you'll realise, it's actually not that bad.
     It's bit by bit."
