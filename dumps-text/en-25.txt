Dream a Little Dream of Me

Our nighttime dreams and even daydreams can help improve our relationships.

   Have you ever dreamed about someone you know?

   Dreams are a mix of the strange and the familiar. While sometimes in
   nighttime dreams we interact with people we’ve never met before, often
   we find that we know the people we see and speak to while asleep. Is
   there something for us to learn in these interactions?

   Perhaps surprisingly, the material in our night dreams and even
   daydreams offer unexpected ways to improve our existing, waking
   relationships. With a little reflection, they can help us expand our
   self-awareness and provide insights about the ways we interact with
   others. Here are three tools for using our nighttime dreams and
   daydreaming to improve our relationships.

Relationship Tool 1: Dreams Hold Other Perspectives

   Challenges are inevitable in any relationship. However, when we
   encounter relationship roadblocks, we usually retreat to our most
   familiar scripts, seeing the other person through a narrow lens. When
   we’re angry at a spouse, for example, it may seem impossible to
   remember them as the person we fell in love with; a flare-up with our
   boss and we forget what a chance they took on us early in our career.
   Yet our nighttime dreams can help return us to a more expanded view.

   While we dream about people we know in waking time, rarely do the
   familiar faces in our dreams behave exactly as we would expect them to
   in waking life. The staid, strict mother is suddenly carefree; the
   couch-surfing, irresponsible brother-in-law now owns a modern, upscale
   house. Waking up, we have the possibility to curiously reflect on the
   differences. We can ask ourselves whether there is something more or
   different to the person than the way we’ve been viewing them in waking
   time.

   Often the difference between a person in our dreams and the way we
   perceive them in waking life puts the new perspectives into motion
   without much effort. From time to time, though, we might even get
   something more direct. For example, once I dreamed of a work colleague
   who, in waking life, was critical of new ideas, making discussions
   difficult. In the dream, the same person knocked on my door and, when I
   opened it, said, “I’m not such a bad egg, after all.”

   In the dream, I simply listened, then shut the door. But in the
   morning, reflecting on the dream, I asked myself whether there was
   something I was missing. The next time a prickly work conversation
   arose I decided to be curious instead of closed off. I noticed that
   underlying the criticisms of new ideas was a respect for process and
   stability. I appreciated such a point of view, and my own prickliness
   eased as a result, shifting our dialogues.

Relationship Tool 2: Imagining How the Other Person Feels

   Most impasses begin with our own hurt feelings. To move out of that, we
   have to bring in other perspectives, including that of the other
   person.

   Daydreaming utilizes the same default network of neural processing that
   operates in our night dreams. We think about this cognitive powerhouse
   as the seat of the imagination, but we also use it to evaluate
   sociomoral scenarios. For example, we use it to reflect on an event and
   the different ways that it could have played out, or to consider how
   other people may have felt about our actions.

   If you think about it, it takes imagination to step into someone else’s
   shoes and sense how they might feel. Likewise, it takes creativity to
   come up with solutions for moving out of conflict and back to
   communication. Imagining the same event from the other person’s point
   of view, and finding new ways of seeing the situation, helps us move
   beyond impasses and back to dialogue.

Relationship Tool 3: “They” Are Me

   One approach to understanding dreams is to view each of the aspects of
   a dream as an aspect of the dreamer. In other words, the people we
   think of as being separate others are in fact reflecting a part of our
   own self.

   What better way to engender compassion than to remember our own
   multiple facets, including the occasional less-favorable qualities and
   traits we tend to assign to others. Peering into the mirror of our
   dreams, we can consider, for example, our own moments of acting staid
   and rigid, shirking responsibility, or being a bad egg.

   What Makes Some Dreams Impossible to Forget?

   What Are Dreams Made Of?

   We all have moments that could use a little tweaking, and recognizing
   that can open a door to renewed conversation. At the same time, the
   myriad perspectives in our dreams remind us that whatever our current
   facet, it is merely one of many aspects, and others are available.
   Knowing that helps us to shift into a more positive aspect of
   ourselves.

   Dreams and our imagination offer a library of feelings, solutions,
   perspectives, and experiences that we can draw on to recognize more
   about ourselves and our relationships. We can get along better with
   others, and in the world, simply by looking within at this treasure
   trove that our own mind generates for us on a nightly basis, or that we
   sink into in our daydreaming. You’ll be surprised how much you can
   learn from people you meet (and know) when you close your eyes.
