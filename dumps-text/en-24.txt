   Phenomenon of the mind while sleeping
   For other uses, see Dream (disambiguation) and Dreams (disambiguation).

   [500px-A_dream_%28BM_1868%2C0808.9057%29.jpg] In this illustration,
   politician Daniel O'Connell dreams of a confrontation between his
   outfit and that of George IV (r. 1820‚Äì1830; shown via a thought bubble)

   A dream is a succession of images, dynamic scenes and situations,
   ideas, emotions, and sensations that usually occur involuntarily in the
   mind during certain stages of sleep.^[1] Humans spend more than two
   hours dreaming per night,^[2] and each dream lasts around 5‚Äì20
   minutes.^[3]

   The content and function of dreams have been topics of scientific,
   philosophical and religious interest throughout recorded history. Dream
   interpretation, practiced by the Babylonians in the third millennium
   BCE^[4] and even earlier by the ancient Sumerians,^[5]^[6] figures
   prominently in religious texts in several traditions, and has played a
   lead role in psychotherapy.^[7]^[8] Dreamwork is similar, but does not
   seek to conclude with definite meaning. The scientific study of dreams
   is called oneirology.^[9] Most modern dream study focuses on the
   neurophysiology of dreams and on proposing and testing hypotheses
   regarding dream function. It is not known where in the brain dreams
   originate, if there is a single origin for dreams or if multiple
   regions of the brain are involved, or what the purpose of dreaming is
   for the body (or brain or mind).

   The human dream experience and what to make of it has undergone sizable
   shifts over the course of history.^[10]^[11] Long ago, according to
   writings from Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt, dreams dictated post-dream
   behaviors to an extent that was sharply reduced in later
   millennia.^[clarification needed] These ancient writings about dreams
   highlight visitation dreams, where a dream figure, usually a deity or a
   prominent forebear, commands the dreamer to take specific actions, and
   which may predict future events.^[12]^[13]^[14] Framing the dream
   experience varies across cultures as well as through time.

   Dreaming and sleep are intertwined. Dreams occur mainly in the
   rapid-eye movement (REM) stage of sleep‚Äîwhen brain activity is high and
   resembles that of being awake. Because REM sleep is detectable in many
   species, and because research suggests that all mammals experience
   REM,^[15] linking dreams to REM sleep has led to conjectures that
   animals dream. However, humans dream during non-REM sleep, also, and
   not all REM awakenings elicit dream reports.^[16] To be studied, a
   dream must first be reduced to a verbal report, which is an account of
   the subject's memory of the dream, not the subject's dream experience
   itself. Therefore, dreaming by non-humans is currently unprovable, as
   is dreaming by human fetuses and pre-verbal infants.^[17]

Etymology

   In Old English, the word drƒìam was used to describe "noise", "joy", or
   "music", but not related to the sleep-induced brain activity. It was
   only in the 13th century that the word dream was used to describe "a
   series of thoughts, images or emotions occurring during sleep".
   Etymologists believe that this change was influenced due to the Old
   Norse draumr, which had the same meaning as the word dream
   nowadays.^[18]

Subjective experience and content

   Preserved writings from early Mediterranean civilizations indicate a
   relatively abrupt change in subjective dream experience between Bronze
   Age antiquity and the beginnings of the classical era.^[19]

   In visitation dreams reported in ancient writings, dreamers were
   largely passive in their dreams, and visual content served primarily to
   frame authoritative auditory messaging.^[20]^[10]^[21] Gudea, the king
   of the Sumerian city-state of Lagash (reigned c. 2144‚Äì2124 BCE),
   rebuilt the temple of Ningirsu as the result of a dream in which he was
   told to do so.^[6] After antiquity, the passive hearing of visitation
   dreams essentially gave way to visualized narratives in which the
   dreamer becomes a character who actively participates.

   From the 1940s to 1985, Calvin S. Hall collected more than 50,000 dream
   reports at Western Reserve University. In 1966, Hall and Robert Van de
   Castle published The Content Analysis of Dreams, outlining a coding
   system to study 1,000 dream reports from college students.^[22] Results
   indicated that participants from varying parts of the world
   demonstrated similarity in their dream content. The only residue of
   antiquity's authoritative dream figure in the Hall and Van de Castle
   listing of dream characters is the inclusion of God in the category of
   prominent persons.^[23] Hall's complete dream reports were made
   publicly available in the mid-1990s by his prot√©g√© William Domhoff.
   More recent studies of dream reports, while providing more detail,
   continue to cite the Hall study favorably.^[24]
   [250px-Dream_of_Polish_volunteers_in_French_army_1914.JPG] A soldier
   dreams: the trenches of WWI. Jan Styka (1858‚Äì1925).

   In the Hall study, the most common emotion experienced in dreams was
   anxiety. Other emotions included abandonment, anger, fear, joy, and
   happiness. Negative emotions were much more common than positive
   ones.^[22] The Hall data analysis showed that sexual dreams occur no
   more than 10% of the time and are more prevalent in young to
   mid-teens.^[22] Another study showed that 8% of both men's and women's
   dreams have sexual content.^[25] In some cases, sexual dreams may
   result in orgasms or nocturnal emissions. These are colloquially known
   as "wet dreams".^[26]

   The visual nature of dreams is generally highly phantasmagoric; that
   is, different locations and objects continuously blend into each other.
   The visuals (including locations, people, and objects) are generally
   reflective of a person's memories and experiences, but conversation can
   take on highly exaggerated and bizarre forms. Some dreams may even tell
   elaborate stories wherein the dreamer enters entirely new, complex
   worlds and awakes with ideas, thoughts, and feelings never experienced
   before the dream.

   People who are blind from birth do not have visual dreams. Their dream
   contents are related to other senses, such as hearing, touch, smell,
   and taste, whichever are present since birth.^[27]

Effects of regional or global catastrophes

   The COVID-19 pandemic also influenced the content of people's dreams,
   according to a scientific study of over 15,000 dream reports by Deirdre
   Barrett. This analysis revealed that themes involving fear, illness,
   and death were two to four times more prevalent in dreams following the
   onset of the pandemic than they were before.^[28]

Neurophysiology

   Main article: Cognitive neuroscience of dreams
   Further information: Neuroscience of sleep

   Dream study is popular with scientists exploring the mind‚Äìbrain
   problem. Some "propose to reduce aspects of dream phenomenology to
   neurobiology."^[29] But current science cannot specify dream physiology
   in detail. Protocols in most nations restrict human brain research to
   non-invasive procedures. In the United States, invasive brain
   procedures with a human subject are allowed only when these are deemed
   necessary in surgical treatment to address medical needs of the same
   human subject.^[30] Non-invasive measures of brain activity like
   electroencephalogram (EEG) voltage averaging or cerebral blood flow
   cannot identify small but influential neuronal populations.^[31] Also,
   fMRI signals are too slow to explain how brains compute in real
   time.^[32]

   Scientists researching some brain functions can work around current
   restrictions by examining animal subjects. As stated by the Society for
   Neuroscience, "Because no adequate alternatives exist, much of this
   research must [sic] be done on animal subjects."^[33] However, since
   animal dreaming can be only inferred, not confirmed, animal studies
   yield no hard facts to illuminate the neurophysiology of dreams.
   Examining human subjects with brain lesions can provide clues, but the
   lesion method cannot discriminate between the effects of destruction
   and disconnection and cannot target specific neuronal groups in
   heterogeneous regions like the brain stem.^[31]

Generation

   Denied precision tools and obliged to depend on imaging, much dream
   research has succumbed to the law of the instrument. Studies detect an
   increase of blood flow in a specific brain region and then credit that
   region with a role in generating dreams. But pooling study results has
   led to the newer conclusion that dreaming involves large numbers of
   regions and pathways, which likely are different for different dream
   events.^[34]

   Image creation in the brain involves significant neural activity
   downstream from eye intake, and it is theorized that "the visual
   imagery of dreams is produced by activation during sleep of the same
   structures that generate complex visual imagery in waking
   perception."^[35]

   Dreams present a running narrative rather than exclusively visual
   imagery. Following their work with split-brain subjects, Gazzaniga and
   LeDoux postulated, without attempting to specify the neural mechanisms,
   a "left-brain interpreter" that seeks to create a plausible narrative
   from whatever electro-chemical signals reach the brain's left
   hemisphere. Sleep research has determined that some brain regions fully
   active during waking are, during REM sleep, activated only in a partial
   or fragmentary way.^[36] Drawing on this knowledge, textbook author
   James W. Kalat explains, "[A] dream represents the brain's effort to
   make sense of sparse and distorted information.... The cortex combines
   this haphazard input with whatever other activity was already occurring
   and does its best to synthesize a story that makes sense of the
   information."^[37] Neuroscientist Indre Viskontas is even more blunt,
   calling often bizarre dream content "just the result of your
   interpreter trying to create a story out of random neural
   signaling."^[38]

Theories on function

   Main article: Oneirology
   Further information: Rapid eye movement sleep

   For many humans across multiple eras and cultures, dreams are believed
   to have functioned as revealers of truths sourced during sleep from
   gods or other external entities.^[39] Ancient Egyptians believed that
   dreams were the best way to receive divine revelation, and thus they
   would induce (or "incubate") dreams. They went to sanctuaries and slept
   on special "dream beds" in hope of receiving advice, comfort, or
   healing from the gods.^[14] From a Darwinian perspective dreams would
   have to fulfill some kind of biological requirement, provide some
   benefit for natural selection to take place, or at least have no
   negative impact on fitness. Robert (1886),^[40] a physician from
   Hamburg, was the first who suggested that dreams are a need and that
   they have the function to erase (a) sensory impressions that were not
   fully worked up, and (b) ideas that were not fully developed during the
   day. In dreams, incomplete material is either removed (suppressed) or
   deepened and included into memory. Freud, whose dream studies focused
   on interpreting dreams, not explaining how or why humans dream,
   disputed Robert's hypothesis^[41] and proposed that dreams preserve
   sleep by representing as fulfilled those wishes that otherwise would
   awaken the dreamer.^[42] Freud wrote that dreams "serve the purpose of
   prolonging sleep instead of waking up. Dreams are the GUARDIANS of
   sleep and not its disturbers."^[43]
   [250px-Taras_Shevchenko_painting_0019.jpg] Grandmother and
   Granddaughter Dream (1839 or 1840). Taras Shevchenko

   A turning point in theorizing about dream function came in 1953, when
   Science published the Aserinsky and Kleitman paper^[44] establishing
   REM sleep as a distinct phase of sleep and linking dreams to REM
   sleep.^[45] Until and even after publication of the Solms 2000 paper
   that certified the separability of REM sleep and dream phenomena,^[16]
   many studies purporting to uncover the function of dreams have in fact
   been studying not dreams but measurable REM sleep.

   Theories of dream function since the identification of REM sleep
   include:

   Hobson's and McCarley's 1977 activation-synthesis hypothesis, which
   proposed "a functional role for dreaming sleep in promoting some aspect
   of the learning process...."^[46] In 2010 a Harvard study was published
   showing experimental evidence that dreams were correlated with improved
   learning.^[47]

   Crick's and Mitchison's 1983 "reverse learning" theory, which states
   that dreams are like the cleaning-up operations of computers when they
   are offline, removing (suppressing) parasitic nodes and other "junk"
   from the mind during sleep.^[48]^[49]

   Hartmann's 1995 proposal that dreams serve a "quasi-therapeutic"
   function, enabling the dreamer to process trauma in a safe place.^[50]

   Revonsuo's 2000 threat simulation hypothesis, whose premise is that
   during much of human evolution, physical and interpersonal threats were
   serious, giving reproductive advantage to those who survived them.
   Dreaming aided survival by replicating these threats and providing the
   dreamer with practice in dealing with them.^[51] In 2015, Revonsuo
   proposed social simulation theory, which describes dreams as a
   simulation for training social skills and bonds.^[52]

   Eagleman's and Vaughn's 2021 defensive activation theory, which says
   that, given the brain's neuroplasticity, dreams evolved as a visual
   hallucinatory activity during sleep's extended periods of darkness,
   busying the occipital lobe and thereby protecting it from possible
   appropriation by other, non-vision, sense operations.^[53]

   Erik Hoel proposes, based on artificial neural networks, that dreams
   prevent overfitting to past experiences; that is, they enable the
   dreamer to learn from novel situations.^[54]^[55]

Religious and other cultural contexts

   Dreams figure prominently in major world religions. The dream
   experience for early humans, according to one interpretation, gave rise
   to the notion of a human "soul",^[56] a central element in much
   religious thought. J. W. Dunne wrote:

     But there can be no reasonable doubt that the idea of a soul must
     have first arisen in the mind of primitive man as a result of
     observation of his dreams. Ignorant as he was, he could have come to
     no other conclusion but that, in dreams, he left his sleeping body
     in one universe and went wandering off into another. It is
     considered that, but for that savage, the idea of such a thing as a
     'soul' would never have even occurred to mankind....^[57]

Hindu

   In the Mandukya Upanishad, part of the Veda scriptures of Indian
   Hinduism, a dream is one of three states that the soul experiences
   during its lifetime, the other two states being the waking state and
   the sleep state.^[58] The earliest Upanishads, written before 300 BCE,
   emphasize two meanings of dreams. The first says that dreams are merely
   expressions of inner desires. The second is the belief of the soul
   leaving the body and being guided until awakened.

Abrahamic

   [250px-Michael_Lukas_Leopold_Willmann_001.jpg] Jacob's dream of a
   ladder of angels, c. 1690. Michael Willmann

   In Judaism, dreams are considered part of the experience of the world
   that can be interpreted and from which lessons can be garnered. It is
   discussed in the Talmud, Tractate Berachot 55‚Äì60.

   The ancient Hebrews connected their dreams heavily with their religion,
   though the Hebrews were monotheistic and believed that dreams were the
   voice of one God alone. Hebrews also differentiated between good dreams
   (from God) and bad dreams (from evil spirits). The Hebrews, like many
   other ancient cultures, incubated dreams in order to receive a divine
   revelation. For example, the Hebrew prophet Samuel would "lie down and
   sleep in the temple at Shiloh before the Ark and receive the word of
   the Lord", and Joseph interpreted a Pharaoh's dream of seven lean cows
   swallowing seven fat cows as meaning the subsequent seven years would
   be bountiful, followed by seven years of famine. Most of the dreams in
   the Bible are in the Book of Genesis.^[59]

   Christians mostly shared the beliefs of the Hebrews and thought that
   dreams were of a supernatural character because the Old Testament
   includes frequent stories of dreams with divine inspiration. The most
   famous of these dream stories was Jacob's dream of a ladder that
   stretches from Earth to Heaven. Many Christians preach that God can
   speak to people through their dreams. The famous glossary, the Somniale
   Danielis, written in the name of Daniel, attempted to teach Christian
   populations to interpret their dreams.

   Iain R. Edgar has researched the role of dreams in Islam.^[60] He has
   argued that dreams play an important role in the history of Islam and
   the lives of Muslims, since dream interpretation is the only way that
   Muslims can receive revelations from God since the death of the last
   prophet, Muhammad.^[61] According to Edgar, Islam classifies three
   types of dreams.^[62] Firstly, there is the true dream (al-ru‚Äôya), then
   the false dream, which may come from the devil (shaytan), and finally,
   the meaningless everyday dream (hulm). This last dream could be brought
   forth by the dreamer's ego or base appetite based on what they
   experienced in the real world. The true dream is often indicated by
   Islam's hadith tradition.^[61] In one narration by Aisha, the wife of
   the Prophet, it is said that the Prophet's dreams would come true like
   the ocean's waves.^[61] Just as in its predecessors, the Quran also
   recounts the story of Joseph and his unique ability to interpret
   dreams.^[61]

   In both Christianity and Islam dreams feature in conversion
   stories.^[63] According to ancient authors, Constantine the Great
   started his conversion to Christianity because he had a dream which
   prophesied that he would win the battle of the Milvian Bridge if he
   adopted the Chi-Rho as his battle standard."^[64]^[65]

Buddhist

   In Buddhism, ideas about dreams are similar to the classical and folk
   traditions in South Asia. The same dream is sometimes experienced by
   multiple people, as in the case of the Buddha-to-be, before he is
   leaving his home. It is described in the MahƒÅvastu that several of the
   Buddha's relatives had premonitory dreams preceding this. Some dreams
   are also seen to transcend time: the Buddha-to-be has certain dreams
   that are the same as those of previous Buddhas, the Lalitavistara
   states. In Buddhist literature, dreams often function as a "signpost"
   motif to mark certain stages in the life of the main character.^[66]

   Buddhist views about dreams are expressed in the PƒÅli Commentaries and
   the Milinda Pa√±hƒÅ.^[66]

   In Chinese history, people wrote of two vital aspects of the soul of
   which one is freed from the body during slumber to journey in a dream
   realm, while the other remained in the body.^[67] This belief and dream
   interpretation had been questioned since early times, such as by the
   philosopher Wang Chong (27‚Äì97 CE).^[67]

   The Babylonians and Assyrians divided dreams into "good," which were
   sent by the gods, and "bad," sent by demons.^[68] A surviving
   collection of dream omens entitled I≈°kar Zaqƒ´qu records various dream
   scenarios as well as prognostications of what will happen to the person
   who experiences each dream, apparently based on previous
   cases.^[6]^[69] Some list different possible outcomes, based on
   occasions in which people experienced similar dreams with different
   results.^[6] The Greeks shared their beliefs with the Egyptians on how
   to interpret good and bad dreams, and the idea of incubating dreams.
   Morpheus, the Greek god of dreams, also sent warnings and prophecies to
   those who slept at shrines and temples. The earliest Greek beliefs
   about dreams were that their gods physically visited the dreamers,
   where they entered through a keyhole, exiting the same way after the
   divine message was given.

   Antiphon wrote the first known Greek book on dreams in the 5th century
   BCE. In that century, other cultures influenced Greeks to develop the
   belief that souls left the sleeping body.^[70] The father of modern
   medicine, Hippocrates (460‚Äì375 BCE), thought dreams could analyze
   illness and predict diseases.^[71] For instance, a dream of a dim star
   high in the night sky indicated problems in the head region, while low
   in the night sky indicated bowel issues.^[72]^[73] Galen (129‚Äì216 AD)
   believed the same thing.^[74] Greek philosopher Plato (427‚Äì347 BCE)
   wrote that people harbor secret, repressed desires, such as incest,
   murder, adultery, and conquest, which build up during the day and run
   rampant during the night in dreams.^[75] Plato's student, Aristotle
   (384‚Äì322 BCE), believed dreams were caused by processing incomplete
   physiological activity during sleep, such as eyes trying to see while
   the sleeper's eyelids were closed.^[76] Marcus Tullius Cicero, for his
   part, believed that all dreams are produced by thoughts and
   conversations a dreamer had during the preceding days.^[77] Cicero's
   Somnium Scipionis described a lengthy dream vision, which in turn was
   commented on by Macrobius in his Commentarii in Somnium Scipionis.

   Herodotus in his The Histories, writes "The visions that occur to us in
   dreams are, more often than not, the things we have been concerned
   about during the day."^[78]

   The Dreaming is a common term within the animist creation narrative of
   indigenous Australians for a personal, or group, creation and for what
   may be understood as the "timeless time" of formative creation and
   perpetual creating.^[79]

   Some Indigenous American tribes and Mexican populations believe that
   dreams are a way of visiting and having contact with their
   ancestors.^[80] Some Native American tribes have used vision quests as
   a rite of passage, fasting and praying until an anticipated guiding
   dream was received, to be shared with the rest of the tribe upon their
   return.^[81]^[82]

Interpretation

   Main article: Dream interpretation

   Further information: Psychoanalysis and Precognition

   [250px-Tissot_Joseph_Interprets_Pharaoh%27s_Dream.jpg] Joseph
   Interprets Pharaoh's Dream c. 1896‚Äì1902. Jacques Joseph Tissot
   (1836‚Äì1902).

   Beginning in the late 19th century, Austrian neurologist Sigmund Freud,
   founder of psychoanalysis, theorized that dreams reflect the dreamer's
   unconscious mind and specifically that dream content is shaped by
   unconscious wish fulfillment. He argued that important unconscious
   desires often relate to early childhood memories and experiences.^[7]
   Carl Jung and others expanded on Freud's idea that dream content
   reflects the dreamer's unconscious desires.

   Dream interpretation can be a result of subjective ideas and
   experiences. One study found that most people believe that "their
   dreams reveal meaningful hidden truths".^[83] The researchers surveyed
   students in the United States, South Korea, and India, and found that
   74% of Indians, 65% of South Koreans and 56% of Americans believed
   their dream content provided them with meaningful insight into their
   unconscious beliefs and desires. This Freudian view of dreaming was
   believed significantly more than theories of dreaming that attribute
   dream content to memory consolidation, problem-solving, or as a
   byproduct of unrelated brain activity. The same study found that people
   attribute more importance to dream content than to similar thought
   content that occurs while they are awake. Americans were more likely to
   report that they would intentionally miss their flight if they dreamt
   of their plane crashing than if they thought of their plane crashing
   the night before flying (while awake), and that they would be as likely
   to miss their flight if they dreamt of their plane crashing the night
   before their flight as if there was an actual plane crash on the route
   they intended to take. Participants in the study were more likely to
   perceive dreams to be meaningful when the content of dreams was in
   accordance with their beliefs and desires while awake. They were more
   likely to view a positive dream about a friend to be meaningful than a
   positive dream about someone they disliked, for example, and were more
   likely to view a negative dream about a person they disliked as
   meaningful than a negative dream about a person they liked.

   According to surveys, it is common for people to feel their dreams are
   predicting subsequent life events.^[84] Psychologists have explained
   these experiences in terms of memory biases, namely a selective memory
   for accurate predictions and distorted memory so that dreams are
   retrospectively fitted onto life experiences.^[84] The multi-faceted
   nature of dreams makes it easy to find connections between dream
   content and real events.^[85] The term "veridical dream" has been used
   to indicate dreams that reveal or contain truths not yet known to the
   dreamer, whether future events or secrets.^[86]

   In one experiment, subjects were asked to write down their dreams in a
   diary. This prevented the selective memory effect, and the dreams no
   longer seemed accurate about the future.^[87] Another experiment gave
   subjects a fake diary of a student with apparently precognitive dreams.
   This diary described events from the person's life, as well as some
   predictive dreams and some non-predictive dreams. When subjects were
   asked to recall the dreams they had read, they remembered more of the
   successful predictions than unsuccessful ones.^[88]

Images and literature

   Graphic artists, writers and filmmakers all have found dreams to offer
   a rich vein for creative expression. In the West, artists' depictions
   of dreams in Renaissance and Baroque art often were related to Biblical
   narrative. Especially preferred by visual artists were the Jacob's
   Ladder dream in Genesis and St. Joseph's dreams in the Gospel according
   to Matthew.

   Many later graphic artists have depicted dreams, including Japanese
   woodblock artist Hokusai (1760‚Äì1849) and Western European painters
   Rousseau (1844‚Äì1910), Picasso (1881‚Äì1973), and Dal√≠ (1904‚Äì1989).

   In literature, dream frames were frequently used in medieval allegory
   to justify the narrative; The Book of the Duchess^[89] and The Vision
   Concerning Piers Plowman^[90] are two such dream visions. Even before
   them, in antiquity, the same device had been used by Cicero and Lucian
   of Samosata.

   (1820‚Äì1914), illustration in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, 1866
   edition

   Dreams have also featured in fantasy and speculative fiction since the
   19th century. One of the best-known dream worlds is Wonderland from
   Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, as well as
   Looking-Glass Land from its sequel, Through the Looking-Glass. Unlike
   many dream worlds, Carroll's logic is like that of actual dreams, with
   transitions and flexible causality.

   Other fictional dream worlds include the Dreamlands of H. P.
   Lovecraft's Dream Cycle^[91] and The Neverending Story's^[92] world of
   Fantastica, which includes places like the Desert of Lost Dreams, the
   Sea of Possibilities and the Swamps of Sadness. Dreamworlds, shared
   hallucinations and other alternate realities feature in a number of
   works by Philip K. Dick, such as The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch
   and Ubik. Similar themes were explored by Jorge Luis Borges, for
   instance in The Circular Ruins.

   Modern popular culture often conceives of dreams, as did Freud, as
   expressions of the dreamer's deepest fears and desires.^[93] In
   speculative fiction, the line between dreams and reality may be blurred
   even more in service to the story.^[94] Dreams may be psychically
   invaded or manipulated (Dreamscape, 1984; the Nightmare on Elm Street
   films, 1984‚Äì2010; Inception, 2010) or even come literally true (as in
   The Lathe of Heaven, 1971).^[93]

Lucidity

   Main article: Lucid dream

   Lucid dreaming is the conscious perception of one's state while
   dreaming. In this state the dreamer may often have some degree of
   control over their own actions within the dream or even the characters
   and the environment of the dream. Dream control has been reported to
   improve with practiced deliberate lucid dreaming, but the ability to
   control aspects of the dream is not necessary for a dream to qualify as
   "lucid"‚Äîa lucid dream is any dream during which the dreamer knows they
   are dreaming.^[95] The occurrence of lucid dreaming has been
   scientifically verified.^[96]

   "Oneironaut" is a term sometimes used for those who lucidly dream.

   In 1975, psychologist Keith Hearne successfully recorded a
   communication from a dreamer experiencing a lucid dream. On April 12,
   1975, after agreeing to move his eyes left and right upon becoming
   lucid, the subject and Hearne's co-author on the resulting article,
   Alan Worsley, successfully carried out this task.^[97] Years later,
   psychophysiologist Stephen LaBerge conducted similar work including:
     * Using eye signals to map the subjective sense of time in dreams.
     * Comparing the electrical activity of the brain while singing awake
       and while dreaming.
     * Studies comparing in-dream sex, arousal, and orgasm.^[98]

   Communication between two dreamers has also been documented. The
   processes involved included EEG monitoring, ocular signaling,
   incorporation of reality in the form of red light stimuli and a
   coordinating website. The website tracked when both dreamers were
   dreaming and sent the stimulus to one of the dreamers where it was
   incorporated into the dream. This dreamer, upon becoming lucid,
   signaled with eye movements; this was detected by the website whereupon
   the stimulus was sent to the second dreamer, invoking incorporation
   into that dreamer's dream.^[99]

Recollection

   Further information: Dream diary

   [250px-Riepenhausen_Raphael%27s_dream.jpg] Raphael's dream (1821).
   Johannes Riepenhausen and Franz Riepenhausen.

   The recollection of dreams is extremely unreliable, though it is a
   skill that can be trained. Dreams can usually be recalled if a person
   is awakened while dreaming.^[100] Women tend to have more frequent
   dream recall than men.^[100] Dreams that are difficult to recall may be
   characterized by relatively little affect, and factors such as
   salience, arousal, and interference play a role in dream recall. Often,
   a dream may be recalled upon viewing or hearing a random trigger or
   stimulus. The salience hypothesis proposes that dream content that is
   salient, that is, novel, intense, or unusual, is more easily
   remembered. There is considerable evidence that vivid, intense, or
   unusual dream content is more frequently recalled.^[101] A dream
   journal can be used to assist dream recall, for personal interest or
   psychotherapy purposes.

   Adults report remembering around two dreams per week, on
   average.^[102]^[103] Unless a dream is particularly vivid and if one
   wakes during or immediately after it, the content of the dream is
   typically not remembered.^[104]

   In line with the salience hypothesis, there is considerable evidence
   that people who have more vivid, intense or unusual dreams show better
   recall. There is evidence that continuity of consciousness is related
   to recall. Specifically, people who have vivid and unusual experiences
   during the day tend to have more memorable dream content and hence
   better dream recall. People who score high on measures of personality
   traits associated with creativity, imagination, and fantasy, such as
   openness to experience, daydreaming, fantasy proneness, absorption, and
   hypnotic susceptibility, tend to show more frequent dream recall.^[101]
   There is also evidence for continuity between the bizarre aspects of
   dreaming and waking experience. That is, people who report more bizarre
   experiences during the day, such as people high in schizotypy
   (psychosis proneness), have more frequent dream recall and also report
   more frequent nightmares.^[101]

Dream-recording machine

   Recording or reconstructing dreams may one day assist with dream
   recall.^[105]^[106] Using the permitted non-invasive technologies,
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electromyography
   (EMG), researchers have been able to identify basic dream
   imagery,^[107] dream speech activity^[108] and dream motor behavior
   (such as walking and hand movements).^[109]^[110]

Miscellany

Illusion of reality

   Main article: Dream argument

   Some philosophers have proposed that what we think of as the "real
   world" could be or is an illusion (an idea known as the skeptical
   hypothesis about ontology). The first recorded mention of the idea was
   in the 4th century BCE by Zhuangzi, and in Eastern philosophy, the
   problem has been named the "Zhuangzi Paradox."

     He who dreams of drinking wine may weep when morning comes; he who
     dreams of weeping may in the morning go off to hunt. While he is
     dreaming he does not know it is a dream, and in his dream he may
     even try to interpret a dream. Only after he wakes does he know it
     was a dream. And someday there will be a great awakening when we
     know that this is all a great dream. Yet the stupid believe they are
     awake, busily and brightly assuming they understand things, calling
     this man ruler, that one herdsman‚Äîhow dense! Confucius and you are
     both dreaming! And when I say you are dreaming, I am dreaming, too.
     Words like these will be labeled the Supreme Swindle. Yet, after ten
     thousand generations, a great sage may appear who will know their
     meaning, and it will still be as though he appeared with astonishing
     speed.^[111]

   The idea also is discussed in Hindu and Buddhist writings.^[112] It was
   formally introduced to Western philosophy by Descartes in the 17th
   century in his Meditations on First Philosophy.

Absent-minded transgression

   Dreams of absent-minded transgression (DAMT) are dreams wherein the
   dreamer absent-mindedly performs an action that he or she has been
   trying to stop (one classic example is of a quitting smoker having
   dreams of lighting a cigarette). Subjects who have had DAMT have
   reported waking with intense feelings of guilt. One study found a
   positive association between having these dreams and successfully
   stopping the behavior.^[113]

Non-REM dreams

   Hypnogogic and hypnopompic dreams, dreamlike states shortly after
   falling asleep and shortly before awakening, and dreams during stage 2
   of NREM-sleep, also occur, but are shorter than REM-dreams.^[114]^[115]

Daydreams

   Main article: Daydream

   [250px-Joseph_Noel_Paton_-_Dante_Meditating.jpg] Dante Meditating,
   1852, by Joseph Noel Paton

   A daydream is a visionary fantasy, especially one of happy, pleasant
   thoughts, hopes or ambitions, imagined as coming to pass, and
   experienced while awake.^[116] There are many different types of
   daydreams, and there is no consistent definition amongst
   psychologists.^[116] The general public also uses the term for a broad
   variety of experiences. Research by Harvard psychologist Deirdre
   Barrett has found that people who experience vivid dreamlike mental
   images reserve the word for these, whereas many other people refer to
   milder imagery, realistic future planning, review of memories or just
   "spacing out"‚Äîi.e. one's mind going relatively blank‚Äîwhen they talk
   about "daydreaming".^[117]^[118]

   While daydreaming has long been derided as a lazy, non-productive
   pastime, it is now commonly acknowledged that daydreaming can be
   constructive in some contexts.^[119] There are numerous examples of
   people in creative or artistic careers, such as composers, novelists
   and filmmakers, developing new ideas through daydreaming. Similarly,
   research scientists, mathematicians and physicists have developed new
   ideas by daydreaming about their subject areas.

Hallucination

   Main article: Hallucination

   A hallucination, in the broadest sense of the word, is a perception in
   the absence of a stimulus. In a stricter sense, hallucinations are
   perceptions in a conscious and awake state, in the absence of external
   stimuli, and have qualities of real perception, in that they are vivid,
   substantial, and located in external objective space. The latter
   definition distinguishes hallucinations from the related phenomena of
   dreaming, which does not involve wakefulness.

Nightmare

   Main article: Nightmare

   [250px-A_perturbed_young_woman_fast_asleep_Wellcome_V0016638.jpg] Woman
   having a nightmare. Jean-Pierre Simon (1764‚Äì1810 or 1813).

   A nightmare is an unpleasant dream that can cause a strong negative
   emotional response from the mind, typically fear or horror, but also
   despair, anxiety and great sadness. The dream may contain situations of
   danger, discomfort, psychological or physical terror. Sufferers usually
   awaken in a state of distress and may be unable to return to sleep for
   a prolonged period of time.^[120]

Night terror

   Main article: Night terror

   A night terror, also known as a sleep terror or pavor nocturnus, is a
   parasomnia disorder that predominantly affects children, causing
   feelings of terror or dread. Night terrors should not be confused with
   nightmares, which are bad dreams that cause the feeling of horror or
   fear.^[121]

D√©j√† vu

   Main article: D√©j√† vu

   One theory of d√©j√† vu attributes the feeling of having previously seen
   or experienced something to having dreamed about a similar situation or
   place, and forgetting about it until one seems to be mysteriously
   reminded of the situation or the place while awake.^[122]

Melatonin

   Main article: Melatonin

   Melatonin is a natural hormone secreted by the brain's pineal gland,
   inducing nocturnal behaviors in animals and sleep in humans during
   nighttime. Chemically isolated in 1958, melatonin has been marketed as
   a sleep aid since the 1990s and is currently sold in the United States
   as an over-the-counter product requiring no prescription. Anecdotal
   reports and formal research studies over the past few decades have
   established a link between melatonin supplementation and more vivid
   dreams.^[123]
