   I don't believe that dreams have any special meaning, or anything.
   Nevertheless, I find dreams interesting. I always try to remember what
   I dreamt about right after I wake up, and I even remember many dreams I
   had when I was still a child.

   So, I've noticed that my dreams kinda have a recurrent theme. Even
   though they are quite messy and they never seem to really have a plot,
   I almost always seem to be anxious about something in them. I'm either
   late for class, or I forgot to feed my cat, or I can't find something I
   really need... There's always something wrong or amiss, and it's
   usually my fault. lol. Last night I dreamt that there were many kitties
   running around inside a house (or some place... I'm not sure if it was
   a house), and I had to pick them up and place them somewhere, but
   whenever I tried to hold one, it would scape and run away. My dream
   self doesn't show any emotions, but I know the whole situation was
   making me feel distressed. Gosh, I have such random dreams. -_-

   Anyway, I really like to hear about people's dreams. So, do you have a
   recurrent dream? What are your dreams like? :)

   Sometimes, I have this dream where there's this giant black ball in
   front of me and I just go to pick off the tiniest piece I can; and for
   some reason, it makes me feel sick once I'm conscious.

   Other than that, I can't really remember any dreams I have. However, I
   can sometimes remember my daydreams and fantasies I have whilst I'm
   awake [usually at the expense of my school work! XD]

   my recurring dreams are usually negative because we have something that
   worries us and we became fixated and consumed by what where afraid of.
   for example i had a recurring dream that someone was chaseing me with a
   neddle because im terrified by needles and had to do blood work that
   following week.

   I often dream about going back to high school or college and doing
   homework I hate, taking boring classes, or taking difficult exams. I
   always feel relieved when I wake up and realize it's just a dream.

   I also tend to dream about important things that are going to happen
   soon, e.g. an exam I'll take tomorrow, an upcoming trip, or a show I'm
   going to see.

   Most of my dreams take place in an academic setting; it gets pretty
   interesting when primary schools and uni are magically combined to form
   one infinitely complex building. I always seem to be running around and
   late for something, though I never quite know what.

   I also often dream about things I've seen/experienced lately. About a
   month ago, my unconscious mind tried to merge The Voice and Mean Girls,
   so I was walking across campus with Janis, Damian, and Adam Levine. The
   really weird part was I was Lindsay Lohan. o_o

   Often it's tornadoes and rain storms.

   Although a couple of nights ago, I dreamed I was at a party that was so
   wild, 3 of the guests were wearing zentais! :blink:

   One interesting characteristic of my dreams is that I'm always aware of
   the geographic direction, even though it's just a dream... anyone else
   experience this?

   Most of my dreams relate to things going on in my life, emotions I'm
   feeling, things I really want to have or to be true or think about
   frequently... sometimes fears and anxieties... usually nothing too
   spectacular. Sometimes the scenarios can be a little far-fetched,
   though usually still based in reality somehow.

   There have been several recurring dreams I've had in my lifetime. As a
   kid, I used to dream about being alone in my parents' car, behind the
   steering wheel, with the car rolling down the hill on the road we lived
   on, headed straight for our mailbox. I always knew I was going to
   crash, but there was nothing I could do to stop the car, no one who
   could help... so I just sat there, terrified. The dream never actually
   got to the point of the car crashing, though; I always woke up while it
   was coasting down the hill. If I recall correctly, I think sometimes
   (though not always) my dad would be standing at the end of our
   driveway, just watching, helpless to do anything. Mostly I had this
   dream between the ages of about four and eight or so.

   The second recurring dream is one that started in my mid-teens and
   which I still have in various forms today (though nowhere near as
   frequently as I used to have it). At 14-15 I developed an eating
   disorder (still with me today at nearly 28), and during the worst years
   of restricting and being extremely underweight, I used to dream at
   least several times a week about completely losing control with food.
   I'd somehow have forgotten in the dream that I had an eating disorder
   and I'd eat normally like I used to (or I'd overeat), and then I'd
   suddenly remember, "Oh shit! I'm not allowed to do this anymore!" Lame
   as it sounds, those were terrifying dreams. I'd get hysterical in them,
   crying and screaming and panicking over what I'd done, how I'd ruined
   everything, how I'd done the worst possible thing in the world that I
   could think of -- something I no longer permitted myself to do in real
   life. Many times I'd wake up in a panic, and even though I'd soon
   realise it had just been a dream, I'd have to check my body, running my
   hands over the familiar bones I could feel, lying on my side with my
   knees together and making sure my thighs didn't touch when I was in
   that position, recalling the last thing I'd had to eat and recounting
   every detail of it in my mind to make absolutely sure I hadn't actually
   eaten something I wasn't "allowed" to. I still sometimes have these
   dreams now, though usually they focus on outright bingeing on massive
   amounts of food (not just eating normally) and then forgetting that I
   was "supposed" to throw it all up... lame, I know. :mellow:

   Nah, it's not lame at all... It actually sounds really anguishing. I
   also think dreams tend to represent things we worry too much about...
   No wonder your eating disorder would be represented in your dreams.

   I think my dreams may represent my OCPD, somehow. Like, because of the
   way I always seem to be anxious about something that went slightly
   wrong in them. In real life, I'm always worried about miserable details
   and obsessed with control, and in my dreams it seems I lose all
   control.

   I wish I could dream of more relaxing stuff, like flying, maybe. I've
   never had a dream where I was flying. lol

   I often dream about going back to high school or college and doing
   homework I hate, taking boring classes, or taking difficult exams. I
   always feel relieved when I wake up and realize it's just a dream.

   I have dreams like those as well. Inside the dream I usually think "oh,
   fuck, why the hell am here? Noooooo, it can't be". :P

   One interesting characteristic of my dreams is that I'm always aware of
   the geographic direction, even though it's just a dream... anyone else
   experience this?

   That's very curious. I think I've never experienced that.

   I try not to dream, my subconscious scares me. tl;dr: murder.

   Now I'm kinda curious. :huh: You murdering someone, someone murdering
   you, or someone murdering someone else? (If you don't mind my asking)

   Me murdering someone else, a stranger. In one case, multiple people.
   After that happens, I feel remorseful in my dream state... It's an
   interesting thing. Usually it's innocent people who I don't know,
   unarmed people. My sleep schedule keeps me quite safe from these
   terrors, however. I go to bed around 3-4am, and wake up whenever. I
   tend to dream when I go to bed at 10pm or earlier. If it's not some
   horrifying event, it's being powerless, which is also horrible. With
   the first example, I was unable to stop what was happening. If I were
   in my right mind, I hope I'll never encounter a situation like that,
   and if I do, I hope I'll not do anything reckless. (I shouldn't, seeing
   as I don't have access to any firearms.)

   Aside from general weirdness, there's an unfortunate streak of
   violence, aggression/threats, and being followed/persecuted/harrassed
   in my dreams. (Thankfully not in all of them, but way, way too common
   for my liking.)

   I often dream about going back to high school or college and doing
   homework I hate, taking boring classes, or taking difficult exams. I
   always feel relieved when I wake up and realize it's just a dream.

   Being back in school is very common for me, too. Over the last two
   years or so, it has shifted noticably, though - before that, it seemed
   just "normal" that I'd be stuck in some kind of infinity loop that
   repeats the last 2-3 school years forever; nowadays, I'm nearly always
   aware that I did graduate 20 years ago already, and just show up
   randomly at school whenever I want (missing 90% of class and 99% of
   homework, to boot... and very aware of having no chance in hell to
   graduate again, but also that I don't need to, as I already did. :)).
   My dream!classmates still are just as I knew them, though - they seem
   forever stuck in their late teens and apparently going through 12th
   grade for the whatever-th time without noticing.

   I never dream about real places. My dreams otherwise follow the laws of
   physics, even though the plot may skip and jump. Very cunning my
   dreams, it's hard for me to consistently pick holes in the reality of
   them (Tried to learn to lucid dream not long ago). The actual plot can
   vary, though if they're indicating something going on in my
   subconscious I usually know as soon as I wake up that they were
   significant. Significant people - you know who you are - often pop up
   in them, often in strange roles (Don't ask!)

   Most of my dreams vary wildly. But I do have a lot of dreams about
   Sherlock and Merlin. Occasionally I'll have dreams that I'll 'wake up'
   in and do stuff before falling asleep or being knocked out in the dream
   and then waking up. It makes things really confusing sometimes. :/

   Me and my mum both have a 'dream reality' where everything will seem
   the same in our dreams but with subtle differences that we don't notice
   until we wake up. Like a whole world in our heads. For example, one
   time my mum dreamt she was in London, but in her dream reality London
   was slightly different. It was a little more maze-like. Streets led to
   different places than usual and sometimes you would find yourself in a
   part of London that doesn't actually exist in reality at all but you
   feel that it does.

   Sometimes, when I realise I am dreaming everything will suddenly fall
   apart like it was an act the whole time. The people around me will
   suddenly get really angry with me for realising that I am dreaming and
   then I wake up feeling a little like I was just about to be attacked by
   those dream people. O_o Scary stuff.

   I also get a lot where people push me off of high places (¬_¬...) and I
   wake up feeling like I am falling...>.<

   It's good that you found a way to deal with it, but I guess it must

   I rarely dream at all

   But when I do, it's often boring and mundane or strange.

   Mine don't have many recurring themes, but the themes are often from
   memories. One about recurring burglary, as I was a victim of it. One
   about experiencing parts of me falling off and rare dreams which I am
   greeted with the characters I use to sooth being overwhelmed and um...
   A number of sexual... Self-pleasure dreams :huh:

   The only recurring theme they have that I can think of is that they're
   all extremely strange and unpredictable. They're like acid trips, minus
   the acid. People often say that I should write books or make movies
   based off the events in my dreams.

   My dream!classmates still are just as I knew them, though - they seem
   forever stuck in their late teens and apparently going through 12th
   grade for the whatever-th time without noticing.

   My former classmates appear in my school dream too, but sometimes I
   only know they're my classmates but don't remember their names.
   Sometimes classmates from different stages mix together in my dream,
   like college classmates and junior high classmates sitting in the same
   classroom.

   Usually something I'm anxious about--a test, a project, an upcoming
   meeting.

   I have a lot of such dreams too, almost guaranteed to happen before a
   big event...

   I've never watched 'Inception'. I don't even really know what its
   about.

   Basically, it's about lucid dreaming in someone else's dream, used for
   thought crime... it's a lot like a classic bank heist movie, only in
   the inside of someone's mind. (And with another dream-related subplot I
   sure won't spoiler you on.... ;)) I definitely recommend giving the
   movie a try if you haven't seen it yet!

   I barely ever dream, and when I do it normally means I'm due a bout of
   insomnia, so it's not exactly a happy occasion. My dreams are weird
   anyway - they make literally no sense. Three nights on the bounce I
   dreamed I was a boy called Jason who had been accused of murder, and
   despite being guilty, was innocent. Nope, I don't follow either. I
   don't have nightmares particularly though, so I guess it's good that
   they're just plain strange.

   My dreams are usually all over the place. The best ones are
   action/adventure themed and the worst ones are work anxiety. Either
   way, I know I dream in color. I just wish I had the artistic ability to
   take some of the vistas I've dreamt of to get them out of my head.

   Funny aside, so I went on Zyrtec a couple of years ago when my
   allergies reached a peak in the spring. The first couple of nights on
   that stuff was wild. I never remembered what I dreamt but I just know
   it was vivid. I woke up feeling pretty good the next morning although
   it could have been the result of actually being able to breathe while
   sleeping. Oxygen to the brain is a good thing!

   All of my dreams are extremely vivid, which would be fine if it wasn't
   for the nightmares. A blanket word I've started using to describe them
   has been "Lovecraftian." Even the more low-key ones have involved
   giant, mutated, wildly colored spiders that are usually everywhere, and
   the dreams I have about tornadoes are strange in the fact that in every
   dream I have about them the horizon always seems to bend away from me.
   These dreams always have a tendency to create a bout of insomnia,
   because I chain dream nightmares, which is not fun. It's actually been
   getting to the point I've been seriously thinking about writing down
   the bulk of what I can remember and turning them into stories.
   Then there are the generally weird dreams, like this one dream I had
   where I was shaving Val Kilmer's face with a Christmas card. But one
   type of dream that I seem to have semi-annually these days (outside of
   the nightmares) are dreams where for some reason I'm chain smoking.
   Sometimes I'm drinking instead, but usually I'm smoking. Which is
   weird, because I do neither, and I find these dreams to be generally
   upsetting.

   One awesome dream I had though, I was apparently a planetary terrain
   mapper who worked from space using a jet pack to get around and
   everyone was wearing Indiana Jones style fedoras. I managed to gain
   lucidity before waking up, too, which was pretty awesome.

   My sleep schedule keeps me quite safe from these terrors, however. I go
   to bed around 3-4am, and wake up whenever. I tend to dream when I go to
   bed at 10pm or earlier.

   It's good that you found a way to deal with it, but I guess it must
   suck when you have to wake up early the next day. :mellow:

   Yeah, it's a little bit stressful on Sundays.

   I used to frequently dream about another planet crashing into the
   earth. It would usually start with me just looking at a sunset or a
   comet or something which would be extremely beautiful and then the
   dream would take a dark turn and this massive round object would appear
   to approach the earth and i would wake up when it's about to hit. it
   was kinda beautiful though because the massive object would always seem
   to be approaching calmly and more like it was merging into the earth
   rather than colliding violently.
   Anyway it's weird to explain to people why jupiter scares me.
   Also i remember reading Coleridge's Kubla Khan for the first time and
   that night i dreamt i was in a deep green grassland that stretched as
   far as i could see and above me the sky was a dark blue melting into
   reds, oranges and yellows at the horizon (i guess my subconscious isn't
   very creative ^_^ ) Infact now that I recall fantastically green,
   tranquil and mystified worlds are a regular theme for my dreams. I have
   dreamt multiple times that i am visiting this place which is basically
   a marble runway with huge marble pillars in middle of a thick forest.
   another time before going to this place i stopped at the entrance to
   have a quick swim in the pond/pool. the water was black and there was
   no one there. I would rather not wake up from these dreams..
   and flying! i've flown a lot in many dreams and it's awesome!

   For 14 years I had a recurring dream. I had it at least once a week
   sometimes up to three, and it involved me going back to work at the pet
   shop I was made redundant from. I loved the job and the people and it
   hurt me massively to be let go. I have never had an anxiety dream that
   would fit the normal bill. No naked classes, no missed bus, late
   homework, but this dream was often about the pain I suffered at being
   axed and at times, me venting.

   When I was very ill this dream and some very disturbing dreams would
   make up most of my dreams. I'm not one for believing the schtick that
   goes with dreams and their meanings and I often baffled my
   Psychologist. I dreamed to have happier dreams. Since coming off of all
   the poison I was forced to take and partially recovering my health, I
   have found myself having multiple jolly nice dreams. Happy, peacefull,
   fun dreams, no waking up screaming the place down dreams. No night
   terrors and when I awake, I feel like I have actually slept. It's bliss
   <_< :)

   Some antidepressants can cause really horrifying dreams (I don't know
   if that's what you were on, but anyway...).

   Oooh yes. I wouldn't want to go off my meds (SSRI antidep), as my
   waking hours are tons better ever since... but I've woken up screaming
   a handful of times since I take them, which I can't remember ever
   having occured before.
