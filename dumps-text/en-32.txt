   Key Takeaways
     * Lucid dreams occur when the sleeper is aware that they are in a
       dream and can exercise some control over their environment.
     * Various approaches can stimulate lucid dreaming and help train a
       person to lucid dream.
     * Frequent lucid dreams might decrease sleep quality or affect one’s
       mental health.

   About 55% of people have realized they were dreaming in the middle of a
   dream Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information
   The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and
   health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information. View
   Source . The experience of recognizing that you’re dreaming in the
   moment is called lucid dreaming. When people lucid dream, they can
   sometimes control what happens next, so they do things they wish they
   could do in real life, such as fly through the air like a superhero,
   spend time with a deceased loved one, or travel across the world.

   People who spontaneously lucid dream are often interested in finding
   ways to lucid dream again. Those who haven’t had a lucid dream may be
   interested in having one for the first time. Researchers have found
   multiple ways to potentially induce lucid dreaming, though the practice
   can come with risks.

What Is Lucid Dreaming?

   Lucid dreaming is a phenomenon in which a sleeper becomes aware that
   they are dreaming while they are still asleep. In about one-third of
   lucid dreams, the sleeper can influence or control what happens during
   the dream Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech
   Information The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances
   science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic
   information. View Source .

   Lucid dreams are distinct from vivid dreams, which are dreams that a
   person can remember in great detail upon waking Trusted Source UpToDate
   More than 2 million healthcare providers around the world choose
   UpToDate to help make appropriate care decisions and drive better
   health outcomes. UpToDate delivers evidence-based clinical decision
   support that is clear, actionable, and rich with real-world insights.
   View Source . While lucid dreams may be vivid, not all vivid dreams
   involve in-the-moment awareness that one is dreaming.
   “Vivid and lucid dreaming are distinct phenomena. While research is
   ongoing, the potential of lucid dreaming as a mental health
   intervention is intriguing, but it should be approached with
   professional guidance.”
   Abhinav Singh, MD, MPH, FAASM
   Abhinav Singh, MD, MPH, FAASM
   Sleep Medicine Physician, MD

   Research indicates that lucid dreaming generally takes place during
   rapid eye movement (REM) sleep—the sleep stage in which most dreaming
   occurs. REM sleep takes place in increasingly long stretches over the
   course of a night, which means that lucid dreams are more likely to
   occur in the second half of a sleep episode Trusted Source StatPearls
   View Source .

   Most people who have lucid dreams describe them as pleasant or even
   blissful experiences. Sleep experts and lucid dreamers have also
   indicated that lucid dreaming can help treat nightmares, reduce anxiety
   and depression, and facilitate creative problem solving.
   Graphic showing approximately 55% of adults have had a lucid dream and
   23% have them one a month.

How to Have a Lucid Dream

   Researchers have found multiple techniques that may help some people
   induce lucid dreaming.
   “Lucid dreaming techniques hold promise, yet they may also lead to
   sleep deprivation. It’s essential to consult a sleep specialist to
   understand the benefits and risks before trying these methods.”

Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams (MILD)

   Mnemonic induction of lucid dreams, also known as the MILD technique,
   appears to be one of the most effective methods for bringing on a lucid

   Source . The MILD technique involves creating an intention to recognize
   when you’re dreaming and carrying that intention into the dream state.
   To use the MILD technique, follow these steps:
    1. Upon awakening in the night, try to recall what you’ve been
       dreaming about or the details of a previous dream you’d like to
       reenter.
    2. Identify signs from the dream that will help you recognize you are
       dreaming if you fall back asleep and successfully reenter the
       dream.
    3. Repeat these words, or your own version of them: “When I begin
       dreaming, I will remember that I’m dreaming.”
    4. Continue recalling dream content and repeating that phrase until
       you fall asleep.

   Even though the MILD technique tends to be more effective than many
   others, it leads to a lucid dream in fewer than one in five cases.
   Evidence suggests that the more quickly you fall back asleep after
   waking, the more likely you will be to have a lucid dream when using
   this technique.

Senses Initiated Lucid Dreams (SSILD)

   The Senses Initiated Lucid Dream (SSILD) technique appears to have
   similar success rates to the MILD technique, although it is newer and
   less studied. This method involves focusing on your senses, which could
   make you more likely to notice the transition into the dream world or
   might prime your mind and body for a lucid dream.

   To practice the SSILD technique, cycle through the following steps
   multiple times. First, go through each step quickly for a few cycles.
   Then, cycle through while spending a few seconds on each step. Finally,
   do up to six slow cycles in which you spend 20 seconds in each step
   and, ideally, fall asleep.
    1. Vision: With your eyelids closed and your eyes relaxed and still,
       focus on what you see. It might simply be darkness, or you might
       see colors, shapes, or images. The goal is not to see anything in
       particular but simply to notice what’s there.
    2. Hearing: Shift your focus to what you can hear. You might hear
       sounds made by your body, such as your heartbeat or breaths, or you
       might hear external sounds, such as crickets chirping or traffic
       noises. Listen without judging.
    3. Body Sensations: Direct your attention to what your body is
       feeling. You might notice internal sensations, such as muscle
       fatigue or air traveling into your lungs. Or, you might notice
       external sensations, such as the warmth and weight of your
       bedding.

Wake Back To Bed (WBTB)

   Wake Back to Bed (WBTB) is often used in combination with other
   techniques intended to induce lucid dreaming Trusted Source National
   Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center for
   Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing
   access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source . In its most
   basic form, WBTB involves purposely waking up during the night, staying
   awake for a period of time, then returning to sleep Trusted Source
   National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center
   for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing
   access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source . Ideally,
   the sleeper disrupts and later returns to REM sleep, setting the stage
   for a lucid dream Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech
   Information The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances
   science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic
   information. View Source .

   To practice WBTB:
    1. Set an alarm for a point in the night in which you are likely to be
       dreaming but will also have the capacity to fall back asleep. Aim
       to wake at least five hours after going to bed or longer.
    2. Stay awake for between 30 minutes and two hours. To boost your
       chances of having a lucid dream, use this time to practice other
       techniques, such as the MILD technique, the SSILD technique, or
       dream journaling.
    3. Go back to sleep. Some research suggests that an hour is the
       optimal time to wait before returning to sleep, while other
       research indicates you’re more likely to have a lucid dream if you
       fall asleep as soon as possible after completing a technique like
       MILD. Experiment with timing to figure out what works for you.

Reality Tests

   Many studies have investigated whether or not the practice of regularly
   conducting “reality tests,” also called “reality checks,” can induce
   lucid dreams or increase their frequency. This approach is intended to
   help a person build a habit of assessing whether they are awake or
   dreaming, thereby improving the likelihood that they will become aware
   of a dream state. However, there is little evidence to support the
   efficacy of this technique, and users have complained that it can be
   difficult and burdensome.

   Still, studies have not ruled out the possibility that reality tests
   might enhance other techniques, and it’s possible that studies haven’t
   required participants to use reality tests for long enough to make a
   difference. If you would like to try this technique, select one or more
   of the following reality tests to perform at least 10 times a day while
   you’re awake, as well as while you are dreaming, if possible:
     * Ask yourself “Am I dreaming?”
     * Assess your surroundings for signs that you might be dreaming.
     * Try breathing through your mouth with your lips pressed together.
       You will only be able to do so if you’re dreaming.
     * Attempt to push your index finger through the palm of the opposite
       hand. If you can, you are dreaming.

Dream Journal

   Some people who have lucid dreams swear by the technique of keeping a
   dream journal, which involves writing down your dreams in as much
   detail as possible as soon as you wake up. Some lucid dreamers say that
   keeping a dream journal trains them to recall their dreams, helps them
   notice “dream signs,” and facilitates reality checks.

   While there is little scientific evidence that dream journals help
   induce lucid dreams, dream journals do appear to improve dream recall,
   which may be useful if you practice the MILD technique. Studies have
   also found that some people have lucid dreams after using dream
   journals in combination with other techniques, such as WBTB.

External Stimulation

   A number of devices are marketed as being able to induce lucid dreams
   by providing various kinds of external stimulation Trusted Source
   National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center
   for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing
   access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source . Many of
   these devices are designed to identify or predict when a sleeper has
   transitioned into REM sleep, often by monitoring brain waves or eye
   movement. When this happens, the devices administer sounds, vibrations,
   or blinking lights that are intended to serve as cues to dreamers,
   helping them realize they are dreaming.

   Some devices also provide transcranial alternating current stimulation
   (tACS), delivering electric currents through the scalp to the frontal
   cortex of the brain. This is intended to generate gamma activity in the
   brain, which studies have linked to lucid dreaming Trusted Source
   National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center
   for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing
   access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source Trusted
   Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National
   Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by
   providing access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source .

   Limited evidence suggests that light cues, combined light and sound
   cues, and tACS may increase the likelihood of having a lucid dream .
   More research is needed to verify that external stimulation devices
   live up to their marketing claims.

Dietary Supplements

   A number of studies indicate that a plant-derived drug called
   galantamine can effectively induce lucid dreams. In its prescription
   form, galantamine is used to treat Alzheimer’s disease, but it’s also
   available as a dietary supplement intended to boost memory and promote
   lucid dreams . Research also indicates that a supplement called
   Alpha-GPC, a form of the nutrient choline, may enhance the
   effectiveness of galantamine.

   Talk to your doctor before taking any dietary supplements. Also, be
   aware that dietary supplements are not regulated like prescription
   drugs, and their contents may not always align with what’s written on
   their packaging.

Combine Techniques

   A recent study found using a combination of techniques produced lucid
   dreams on 42% of the nights during the study period, which is the best
   rate of lucid dream induction on record. Based on these findings, some
   experts propose the following steps as the most effective way to induce
   a lucid dream:
    1. Take vitamin B6 before going to bed to boost your body’s choline
       levels.
    2. Set an alarm to wake you 5 hours after going to sleep.
    3. After you wake to your alarm, take a combination of galantamine and
       Alpha-GPC.
    4. Practice the MILD technique or the SSILD technique.
    5. Put on a device that provides light stimulation.
    6. Return to sleep as soon as possible.

Is Lucid Dreaming Bad For You?

   While many people view lucid dreams as pleasant and desirable, they can
   be negative experiences for some people. On occasion, they may even
   pose risks to physical and mental health.
     * Sleep loss: Many methods of inducing lucid dreams require a person
       to wake in the night, which disrupts sleep Trusted Source National
       Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center for
       Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing
       access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source .
       Additionally, some people report difficulty falling back asleep or
       poor sleep quality after failed attempts to induce lucid dreams.
       Sleep loss can have serious implications for a person’s health and
       wellbeing.
     * Altered sleep architecture: Because the brain behaves differently
       during lucid dreaming than it does during non-lucid REM sleep, some
       experts have expressed concern that lucid dreaming might disrupt
       important processes that ordinarily occur during REM sleep.
     * Sleep paralysis: Some people who induce lucid dreams experience
       sleep paralysis, an intrusion of REM sleep into waking that
       temporarily prevents a person from moving or speaking.
     * Dysphoric dreams: Sometimes, failed attempts to induce a lucid
       dream can lead to nightmares. Moreover, while lucid dreams are
       usually positive experiences, people have reported lucid nightmares
       in which they are aware they are dreaming but unable to escape
       terrifying or horrific dream content.
     * Reality confusion: Some people experience “false awakenings” during
       lucid dreams that lead to confusion about whether they are awake or
       asleep.
     * Dissociative states: For some people, deliberately inducing lucid
       dreams can lead to mental states in which they have trouble
       integrating or controlling their emotions, sense of self,
       understanding of reality, and connection to their bodies Trusted
       Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The
       National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and
       health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information.
       View Source . People with certain mental illnesses may be
       especially vulnerable to this effect.

   Before attempting to induce a lucid dream, it’s important to consider
   these risks. If you have any concerns or you plan to use dietary
   supplements, make sure to discuss your plans with a doctor or mental
   health professional.
   “While the study of dreams continues to captivate researchers and the
   general population, conducting large-scale, objective scientific
   studies remains challenging and is currently limited.”
