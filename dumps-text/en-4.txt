   Frazer Clarke said he grew up loving the sport and watching the greats

   Lifting the British heavyweight title would be the fullfilment of a
   dream for boxing champion Frazer Clarke.

   The Staffordshire fighter, an Olympic bronze medallist, has been in the
   gym "day in, day out", preparing for Saturday's match against Jeamie
   'TKV' Tshikevaat at Derby's Vaillant Arena.

   The fight was originally scheduled for October, but had to be
   rescheduled after TKV suffered an injury in training.

   The 34-year-old from Burton-upon-Trent said his training meant he had
   barely seen his children but they would appreciate it when their dad
   became a British champion.

   He was still that 11-year-old boy who used to go on YouTube and watch
   all the greats, he said, listing fighters such as Muhammad Ali, Ricky
   Hatton, Lennox Lewis, Mike Tyson, Sugar Ray Leonard and Roy Jones as
   his inspirations.

   "I'm still that kid inside, you know this doesn't feel like work to
   me," he said.

   "It's hard, don't get me wrong, but I still love the sport. I'm very
   privileged to be able to do my passion as a living."

'Missed family holidays'

   The boxer won his bronze medal at Tokyo in 2020 in the Men's Super
   Heavyweight category.

   An earlier attempt at winning the heavyweight title ended in a draw and
   then defeat against current WBO world champion Fabio Wardley.

   Clarke turned professional after winning bronze at the 2020 Olympics.

   "I've got a 12-week-old daughter," Clarke said, "I've barely seen her."

   "I've got two other beautiful kids. They had six weeks' holidays - I
   didn't get to do the usual stuff, the holidays, the trips and that.

   "I was in this gym day in, day out.

   "But listen, they'll appreciate it because their dad is going to become
   British heavyweight champion."

   His training at the Lions Den Boxing Club in Heanor, Derbyshire, has
   included strength and conditioning sessions.

   "We all come with our plans, but at the end of the day boxing is not
   scripture," trainer Angel Fernandez said.

   "You know we're going to have to be able to adjust and that's what we
   have been preparing for [with] this game - to be able to adjust
   throughout the rounds."

   The match will be shown live on BBC Two from 20:00 GMT as boxing
   returns to BBC terrestrial TV after 20 years.

   There is also radio commentary on BBC Radio Derby and BBC Sounds from
   18:00.
