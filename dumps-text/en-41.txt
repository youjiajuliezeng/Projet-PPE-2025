   A long-time Indiana football fan is headed to the Rose Bowl.

   Bill Murphy, who lives to the east of Indianapolis, has been an IU
   season ticket holder for 66 years!

   The vast majority of those have been losing seasons with a few bright
   spots, few and far between.

   Indiana's only previous Rose Bowl experience was in 1968, which they
   lost.

   For Murphy, this trip is the chance to fulfill a lifelong dream.

   He was 15 the last time IU headed to California for the Rose Bowl and
   wasn't allowed to go.
   BE THE FIRST TO COMMENT

   IU plays Alabama on New Year's Day in the Rose Bowl, which Murphy will
   be at!
