   The mural, which features flowers and insects, makes the owner feel
   like she is sitting in a garden

   A 94-year-old woman says a huge mural painted on the side of her house
   gives her a "dream garden" that she "doesn't need to look after".

   Muriel Baker, from Meare near Glastonbury in Somerset, had her wall
   transformed into a countryside scene.

   She cannot manage the weeding or watering needed for a garden, but this
   option lets her feel as though she's sitting in one while enjoying a
   coffee or tea, she added.

   It is the second mural she has had painted on her house, which she says
   "attracts people from all over".

   Ms Baker told BBC Radio Somerset: "I've not got any garden myself, I
   can't do any gardening and I thought wouldn't it be nice to have a
   garden on the wall."

   The £2,000 mural features her favourite things – flowers, birds, and
   butterflies.

   She said: "I've had a lot of people come and look at it and they really
   enjoy it."

   This is Ms Baker's second mural

   Local artist Jon Minshull painted a farmhouse scene on a separate wall
   at Ms Baker's house.

   In total he has completed nearly 30 murals in the area, including a
   giant giraffe.

   "That one required four stages of scaffolding," he said.

   "It usually takes about a week to complete a house-sized wall."
