   Ashleigh Rollins: Hoping to back on the pitch and playing in 12 months

   A Devon student refused to let a devastating knee injury stop her from
   seizing a dream role at the Women's Rugby World Cup.

   Ashleigh Rollins, 20, from South Molton, spent four weeks working as a
   paid media intern for World Rugby at Sandy Park in Exeter during the
   tournament, while waiting for surgery on a ruptured ligament and torn
   meniscus.

   "It was incredible being picked for the internship and I was determined
   nothing would get in my way," said Ms Rollins, a second-year BA Sports
   Journalism student at Plymouth Marjon University.

   "I found myself spending four weeks straight at Sandy Park, watching
   the games and interviewing some of the biggest names on the planet. And
   I got paid to do it."

   people sitting on a blue sofa in what appears to be a lounge or waiting
   area. One person is wearing a bright turquoise jacket with colourful
   stripes on the sleeves and is holding a notepad and pen. The other
   person is dressed in a white sports shirt with a logo and dark shorts.

   Italy and Exeter Chiefs

   Her job was to sit in press conferences, record quotes and send them to
   editors for the Rugby News Service.

   "I'd see my work used by the BBC and other national and international
   media," she said.

   "It was daunting at first as there were other journalists in the room
   but I quickly gained confidence in asking questions."

   Ms Rollins met stars including New Zealand's Braxton Sorensen-McGee and
   Canada's finalists.

   "Even with the smaller teams like South Africa and Fiji it was amazing
   seeing their passion for their sport," she said.

   "And one of the Welsh players reached out to me on Instagram after I'd
   put up a post about my injury. She had the same thing and offered me
   advice and support."

   Just days before England's win in the final, Ms Rollins had surgery on
   23 September.

   "Plymouth Marjon have been very supportive after my injury, and
   especially my lecturers who have been incredibly understanding about
   the situation," she said.

   She said she now wanted to get back in the game she loved playing as
   soon as possible.

   "My physio said that my progress is great. I'm doing everything I
   should be doing and, hopefully, in 12 months' time, I will be back on
   the pitch," she said.

   [grey-placeholder.png] The picture shows a peaceful winter landscape
   with a large lake in the middle reflecting the blue sky and scattered
   clouds above. Surrounding the lake are gently rolling hills covered in
   a light layer of snow, giving the scene a crisp and bright appearance.
   In the foreground, there is a grassy area partially dusted with snow
   and a few large rocks lying near the edge. On the right side, there are
   clusters of leafless trees and some evergreen trees. The background
   stretches into distant hills, also blanketed in snow, under a sky that
   mixes patches of blue with dramatic white and grey clouds.
