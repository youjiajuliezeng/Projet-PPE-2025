   Ashleigh Rollins: Hoping to back on the pitch and playing in 12 months

   A Devon student refused to let a devastating knee injury stop her from
   seizing a dream role at the Women's Rugby World Cup.

   Ashleigh Rollins, 20, from South Molton, spent four weeks working as a
   paid media intern for World Rugby at Sandy Park in Exeter during the
   tournament, while waiting for surgery on a ruptured ligament and torn
   meniscus.

   "It was incredible being picked for the internship and I was determined
   nothing would get in my way," said Ms Rollins, a second-year BA Sports
   Journalism student at Plymouth Marjon University.

   "I found myself spending four weeks straight at Sandy Park, watching
   the games and interviewing some of the biggest names on the planet. And
   I got paid to do it."

   people sitting on a blue sofa in what appears to be a lounge or waiting
   area. One person is wearing a bright turquoise jacket with colourful
   stripes on the sleeves and is holding a notepad and pen. The other
   person is dressed in a white sports shirt with a logo and dark shorts.

   Italy and Exeter Chiefs

   Her job was to sit in press conferences, record quotes and send them to
   editors for the Rugby News Service.

   "I'd see my work used by the BBC and other national and international
   media," she said.

   "It was daunting at first as there were other journalists in the room
   but I quickly gained confidence in asking questions."

   Ms Rollins met stars including New Zealand's Braxton Sorensen-McGee and
   Canada's finalists.

   "Even with the smaller teams like South Africa and Fiji it was amazing
   seeing their passion for their sport," she said.

   "And one of the Welsh players reached out to me on Instagram after I'd
   put up a post about my injury. She had the same thing and offered me
   advice and support."

   Just days before England's win in the final, Ms Rollins had surgery on
   23 September.

   "Plymouth Marjon have been very supportive after my injury, and
   especially my lecturers who have been incredibly understanding about
   the situation," she said.

   She said she now wanted to get back in the game she loved playing as
   soon as possible.

   "My physio said that my progress is great. I'm doing everything I
   should be doing and, hopefully, in 12 months' time, I will be back on
   the pitch," she said.

   surrounded by rolling green hills and countryside. In the foreground,
   there is a calm river running horizontally across the bottom of the
   image, with a few small boats moored along its edge and a line of trees
   bordering the water. Behind the river, there are rows of houses and
   buildings packed closely together, forming a dense residential area.
   The houses are mostly two-storey, painted in light colours such as
   white, cream, and pastel shades, with sloping roofs.

   of a road. The front of the vehicle is almost completely destroyed,
   with the engine area exposed and charred. Thick smoke is rising from
   the wreckage, suggesting the fire has only recently been put out. The
   car doors are open, and the paintwork is scorched and peeling. Two
