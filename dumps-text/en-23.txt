   What, to the Writer, <br>Are Dreams?

What, to the Writer,
Are Dreams?

Lauren Acampora on the Mythic Links Between
Dream Life and Creativity

   via Grove
   Lauren Acampora June 11, 2019

   “Dream is the personalized myth, myth the depersonalized dream.”
   –Joseph Campbell
   Article continues after advertisement

   One morning, when I was younger, I gave a detailed description of my
   previous night’s dream to my mother. When I finished, she said, “I’m
   going to tell you something. Don’t ever share your dreams with anyone
   except your spouse. It’s boring to listen to other people’s dreams.”

   I was offended at first. How could anyone, not to mention my own
   mother, fail to find my dreams as fascinating as I did? But of course
   she was right; it’s almost always deadly to hear other people talk
   about their dreams. As a rule, dreams die in the glare of the waking
   world, their shimmering aura evaporating in the harsh air outside the
   psyche. And yet, paradoxically, it’s the emotional aura of dreams that
   makes them feel so urgently worth sharing in the first place.

   Needless to say, I didn’t listen to my mother. That is, I still share
   my dreams promiscuously—just not verbally.

   Like so many other writers and artists, I employ dreams in my creative
   work. They’re an engine, a lending library. It’s a thrill to awake with
   a strange, arresting image in mind, or still grasping the thread of an
   allegorical dream story. Sometimes, a vision or scenario arrives as a
   package deal: the story is encased within the vision, packed up tight
   with a certain mood. For me, entire short stories have sprung from such
   vision: a woman alone in a pool, a finger touching a brain, a
   blindfolded child. A haunting dream of orange curtains in a hotel room
   has rolled into an entire novel (in which orange hotel curtains do not
   ever appear). And the power and mystery of dreams themselves inspired
   my novel The Paper Wasp, in which the narrator illustrates—and
   ultimately enters—her vivid, seemingly premonitory dreams.

   There’s no shortage of literature and art that we know to have sprung
   from dreams. As legend has it, the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge
   transcribed the first lines of “Kubla Khan” from a dream; the idea for
   Frankenstein came to Mary Shelley in her sleep; Robert Louis Stevenson
   conceived of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in a consumptive fever dream;
   Stephen King came up with the idea for Misery while napping on a plane;
   William Styron had a dream that inspired Sophie’s Choice. One of the
   most prolific dream miners of all was Edgar Allen Poe, who used his
   frequent nightmares in much of his work. And famously, Paul McCartney
   dreamed the tune for the song “Yesterday.” Upon waking, he asked his
   friends if they knew it. “It’s a good little tune,” he said, “but I
   couldn’t have written it because I dreamt it.”

   Dreams can feel like messages from another place, so it’s no surprise
   that many ancient cultures believed dreams to be transmissions of
   divine knowledge. The Ancient Egyptians considered dreams to be
   oracular and held vivid dreamers in high regard. They practiced dream
   incubation and lucid dreaming, and employed dream guides called the
   “Masters of Secret Things” who lived in dream temples. The Greeks, too,
   incubated dreams, and thought that gods came to dreamers through a
   keyhole to deliver messages. The Aboriginal Australians and the
   Iroquois started their day by sharing dreams, which were considered a
   source of guidance for both the individual and the community. The Hindu
   religion, too, believes that in dreams one is given a glimpse of
   Vishnu, whose own dreaming mind creates our reality. It isn’t difficult
   to understand where such beliefs come from if you’ve ever dreamed of
   reading a book, sentence after lucid, elaborate sentence. “I couldn’t
   have written it,” you might think, “because I dreamt it.”

   It’s difficult, even paradoxical, to try to bear total witness to
   dreams, akin to pinning down the present moment, halting the slippage
   of time.

   Brain science validates this phenomenon. Dreaming occurs during REM
   sleep, when the frontal lobe, the executive area of the brain, is shut
   down. Dreams are the mysterious activity of another part of the brain,
   beneath the scrutiny of the frontal lobe. Neurologically speaking, we
   really are receiving transmissions from a foreign entity; the
   unconscious, unobserved self slips through the keyhole when the guard
   is off duty.

   Even during waking hours, the human brain is divided: the
   executive-desk frontal lobe and the inscrutable, intuitive limbic
   system are strangers to each other. In sleep, they are incommunicado.
   Because of this deep rift, the great majority of our dreams go
   unremembered, except on a buried emotional level. It’s difficult, even
   paradoxical, to try to bear total witness to them, akin to pinning down
   the present moment, halting the slippage of time. Just as the present
   can only be considered in retrospect, the unconscious mind can only be
   discerned via the remembered scraps of dreams. Any glimmers of
   awareness that may come during sleep, when a dream is fleetingly
   apprehended, are instances of the conscious half of the brain briefly
   observing and translating the activity of the submerged half:
   interpreting the enigmatic message of a stranger. These glimmers are
   rare and fleeting, occurring only during the hypnogogic and hypnopompic
   states, the liminal states between wakefulness and sleep.

   In siphoning dreams for their work, writers and artists are tapping a
   valuable well. Dream logic and imagery carries an uncanny, allegorical
   quality that resonates deeply with readers and audiences. And it’s
   possible that dream recall actually enhances artistic output during
   waking hours. Scientific studies have confirmed a correlation between
   dream recall and creativity; those who recall dreams actually perform
   better on creativity evaluations. This may be because creative people
   are naturally better at recalling their dreams. It’s a chicken or egg
   situation: do creative people have more vivid and memorable dreams
   because they are innately creative, or can a brain become more creative
   through strengthening dream recall? Whatever the case, making use of
   dreams in art is a powerful way to reflect our foreign selves back to
   ourselves, while projecting that mystery self out to the world as
   archetypal image and story—dream as personalized myth, myth as
   depersonalized dream.

   For writers, plugging into the unconscious provides a direct line to
   the human imagination in all its splendor and darkness. Indeed, in the
   midst of composing, it’s often unclear where the words are coming from.
   Sentences and imagery sometimes bubble up from a hidden well that
   surprises the conscious, transcribing mind. Some writers will tell you
   that they write in order to exorcise their demons, cleanse their
   psyches, to bring their fears and darkness into the light. Some will
   tell you that it’s better than therapy.

   Writing at full tilt can be a euphoric state, tantamount to lucid
   dreaming. It’s half-awareness—one foot in, one foot out—a balance on
   the brink of consciousness. It’s not just in dreams that we can
   experience the ecstasy of flight and the exhilaration of omnipotence,
   but also when writing, when the words are flowing, the images
   appearing. Just as in a lucid dream, this exhilaration is paired with
   the knowledge that it can’t last, that it’s a temporary spell. Soon,
   we’ll become too aware of flying, and the spell will break and drop us
   to the ground. Still, we endeavor to capture and recapture this ecstasy
   of creative freedom, the ability to travel lightly anywhere at will,
   the bliss of floating to the treetops.

   If writing fiction is analogous to dreaming, the experience of reading
   fiction can be, too. When we’re reading, another person is able to
   intrude into our psyches through the use of words alone, remotely
   projecting imagery onto the screens of our minds, suffusing them with
   atmosphere and mood. We are, in a way, sharing a dream with a stranger.
   And fiction, at its best, places a mirror before us, evoking terror and
   wonder. It affects us on an emotional level beyond language, and brings
   a frisson of recognition. There’s a momentary astonishment to encounter
   the familiar within the strange, something of our own inner lives on
   the page. There’s the eerie sense that the author has somehow entered
   and seen into us. The best art carries this sense of inevitability, of
   allegory, myth, dream—a truth that has always been there, that we
   already know in some deep part of ourselves.

   This flare of astonishment is arguably the purpose of art. It’s the
   sudden thinning of the distance between us, the erosion of barriers
   that have been built and propped up by our conscious, waking lives.
   Like a flash of lightning, great art illuminates the human landscape in
   its breathtaking entirety and shows that the barriers are flimsy,
   false, only temporarily there. All at once, we are taken outside
   ourselves and given a glimpse of the Jungian collective unconscious,
   the subliminal wholeness of life, the enveloping dream of Vishnu. What
   is the purpose of all art, if not to puncture the illusion of
   fragmentation, to reveal the commonality of human experience, to return
   us—if briefly—to those collective waters?
