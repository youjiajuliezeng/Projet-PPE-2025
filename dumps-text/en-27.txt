   In our dreams, we typically don’t question bizarre phenomena, like
   losing all our teeth or being chased by giant orange snakes. We accept
   the strange reality of our dream worlds, unable to find a reasonable
   explanation or solution.

   That’s because during sleep, we lose the ability to reflect critically
   on our own thoughts and analyses, a process known as metacognition. But
   sometimes, something tips us off. It suddenly becomes clear — we don’t
   normally go to school in a giant dripping cave or have the ability to
   fly, and we realize: This is a dream.

   The state of recognizing you are dreaming is known as lucid dreaming.
   In neuroscience terms, this happens when your capacity for
   metacognition comes back online. You’re able to examine your beliefs in
   the moment and assess whether the conclusions you’re drawing — like “my
   school is a cave” or “I was always able to fly” — jibe with reality.

   “The mind is quite restricted during sleep and dreaming, but lucid
   dreaming is the exception. Our reflective capability can be as strong
   and intact as it is during wakefulness,” said Martin Dresler, principal
   investigator at the Donders Sleep & Memory lab at Radboud University in
   the Netherlands.

   For the most part, we can't consciously choose what we dream about. But
   actively recognizing you are dreaming creates the opportunity for
   varying levels of dream control. Advanced lucid dreamers can alter the
   plot of their dreams, transform themselves into animals or other
   people, change their environment, and distort the laws of physics.

   Most people lucid dream just a few times in their lifetime, if at all.
   And even if they gain an awareness of their dream state, it’s even more
   rare to be able to actively control their dream content in real time.

   “Something like one in 1,000 or so people just spontaneously have lucid
   dreams on a regular basis,” said Benjamin Baird, an assistant research
   professor at the University of Texas at Austin. “It’s interesting that
   this segment exists.”

Piecing Together What Makes a Lucid Dream

   An April 2025 Journal of Neuroscience study led by Çağatay Demirel, a
   PhD researcher in Dresler’s lab, used EEG data from different labs
   around the world to try to get a clearer picture of the lucid dreaming
   brain. They found widespread communication across different brain
   regions. But when it comes to pinpointing which specific areas were
   particularly active, the picture is still quite fuzzy.

   Dresler’s team found lucid dreaming is associated with widespread
   communication across different brain regions. This diagram from their
   2025 study shows heightened alpha wave connectivity in posterior brain
   regions compared to typical REM sleep.
   Journal of Neuroscience

   “After the initial Eureka-like insight of ‘I’m in a dream!’, this
   realization just lingers in the back of the lucid dreamer’s mind,
   whereas the ongoing dream scenario … [is] in the mental focus,” Dresler
   explained. Even though the brain regions involved in lucidity are
   active, their precise signals are obscured by the “neural noise” of the
   actual dream, he added, making their EEG recordings hard to capture.

   fMRI studies do a better job of pinpointing activity in specific brain
   regions, but they are expensive, and because lucid dreams are so rare,
   there’s no guarantee a study participant will achieve the desired state
   while in the machine. In 2012, Dresler’s team successfully completed
   the only fMRI ever performed of an actively lucid dreaming brain. They
   found certain brain regions that are usually relatively quiet during
   REM sleep — including the prefrontal cortex, precuneus, and
   occipito-temporal cortices — showed activation in the person’s brain
   while lucid dreaming.

   Six years later, Baird and his colleagues used fMRI to study the brains
   of 14 frequent lucid dreamers while they were awake and not performing
   any specific tasks. What they found was strikingly similar to Dresler’s
   observations of the brain while actively lucid dreaming: increased
   communication between the brain’s metacognition center — the prefrontal
   cortex — and parietal and temporal structures, which are associated
   with high-level cognition.

   The findings indicate “a more tight-knit community of higher-order
   association hubs in the brain[s]” of frequent lucid dreamers, said
   Baird. This research suggests frequent lucid dreamers have a relatively
   high capacity for things like metacognition and cognitive control, or
   the ability to regulate thoughts, attention, and emotions.

The Effect of Dreams on Waking Life

   Those with strong dream control use this power in a variety of ways,
   from spiritual development to overcoming deep-seated fears. Some lucid
   dreamers even use their sleeping hours to train for sports or dance
   performances or process problems they face in waking life.

   But according to one study, the most common application of lucid
   dreaming is wish fulfillment. Lucid dreamers are able to carry out
   desires out of reach in waking life, like exploring outer space or
   interacting with a loved one who passed away. Even though these
   scenarios did not happen in real life, the pleasurable experiences of
   lucid dreams seem to have a “spill-over effect” into waking life,
   leading to positive daytime mood.

   These insights have sparked a new interest in exploring lucid
   dreaming’s potential for treating mental health disorders. In 2018, the
   American Academy of Sleep Medicine started to recommend it as a therapy
   for nightmare disorders, including those associated with post-traumatic
   stress disorder (PTSD). Neuroscientists have also found ways to treat
   insomnia with lucid dream therapy, which can ameliorate some
   psychiatric symptoms.

   But turning lucid dreaming into a treatment may not be so simple, and
   such a therapy would carry a unique set of risks. Failed attempts at
   lucid dreaming can result in sleep paralysis — waking up but being
   temporarily unable to move — or false awakening — the disorienting
   experience of thinking you’re awake and carrying out your day, only to
   realize you are still asleep. Such experiences can blur the line
   between dream life and reality, which can exacerbate symptoms for those
   prone to delusions or hallucinations.

A Rare Gift, But A Learnable Skill

   Still, the allure of reaching this rare state of consciousness has led
   to creative ways to try to get there. Techniques to induce lucid
   dreaming are difficult to master and almost guarantee multiple nights
   of interrupted sleep. In the 1990s, lucid dream induction headsets hit
   the commercial market, but their high price tags and varying
   effectiveness make them a controversial choice.

   Baird and his team found the Alzheimer’s drug galantamine, which is
   used to treat memory and other cognitive impairments, increases lucid
   dream frequency by up to 42% compared to placebo. The drug increases
   levels of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter known to play a role in REM
   sleep, which is when most lucid dreaming occurs.

   However, some believe the therapeutic potential of lucid dreaming comes
   by building the skills of metacognition and cognitive control.
   Researchers are studying how practices reinforcing these skills like
   meditation may encourage lucid dreaming while offering the added
   benefits of stress reduction, improved sleep, and other enhanced
   markers of well-being.

   Baird described meditation as neurocognitive training for the very
   skills required to lucid dream. “You kind of develop this ‘witness
   mode’ where you’re recognizing the state of your mind,” said Baird.
   “You also have to be able to notice if your mind has drifted from the
   target and then bring it back, and so that involves a kind of
   metacognitive reflection.”

   Research shows long-term meditators are prone to lucid dreaming. But in
   a 2019 study, when Baird and his team had non-meditators undergo eight
   weeks of mindfulness training, they found no increase in lucid dream
   frequency.

   He believes the meditation protocol was simply too weak. “It was kind
   of like an intro to meditation,” he said. “It’s not like, say, going on
   a two-month retreat where you’re meditating for eight hours per day.”
   And one of Baird’s recent studies suggests some meditation styles may
   be more effective in facilitating lucid dreaming than others.

An Ancient Practice to Control Your Dreams

   “Mindfulness is the tip of the iceberg,” said S. Gabriela
   Torres-Platas, a neuroscientist at Northwestern University. She is
   studying the effects of Tibetan dream yoga on sleep and mental health.
   This contemplative practice incorporates a variety of meditative
   exercises into waking and sleeping life, and its specific goal is to
   induce lucid dreams for personal insight and spiritual growth.

   Before bed, a practitioner might review the events of their day,
   assessing whether their actions demonstrated a mindful, volitionally
   controlled response or a reactive, emotionally dysregulated response.

   Those moments of reacting without thinking “create non-lucidity,” said
   Katie Love, a dream yoga practitioner and participant in Torres-Platas’
   study, suggesting that a lack of awareness over our actions in waking
   life encourages a lack of awareness in dream states.

   Dream yogis perform seemingly impossible tasks in their lucid dreams,
   like transforming into different dream characters, walking through
   walls, or multiplying one object into thousands of copies. These
   techniques allow practitioners to help cultivate mastery within their
   dream worlds, which may foster a greater sense of empowerment and
   agency in their waking lives.

   “We perceive the world as rigid and solid,” said Torres-Platas, but
   “when you can go into a dream and change your environment by, for
   example, walking through a wall, you train your mind for flexibility”
   in the real world.

   She hypothesizes that practicing specific meditation techniques while
   awake, combined with lucid dreaming while asleep, may help ease
   symptoms of anxiety and depression by increasing one's insight and
   control over their thoughts and emotions.

   “You have learned to react in a certain way, so it bypasses conscious
   awareness,” said Torres-Platas, highlighting how automatic patterns can
   override metacognition and self-regulation. “It’s like when someone
   insults you, and you snap back — there’s no space for reflection or
   choice in the moment.”

   She said the deep self-reflection required to gain lucidity while
   dreaming may teach us how to better navigate difficult circumstances.
   Instead of persisting in a mindset of agony or hopelessness, we can
   reflect on how we process and analyze the world, which gives us the
   opportunity to reframe our thoughts. Where pessimistic beliefs leave us
   stuck in a swirling pit of despair, lucid dreaming might open a path to
   something else.
