Despair for would-be US citizens as American dream blocked by Trump

   Aspirant Americans tell of exclusions from ceremonies by sudden policy
   introduced on ‘security’ grounds

   The occasion should have been marked by the joy of reaching the
   destination of US citizenship following the long odyssey of
   immigration.

   Instead, the ceremony at Boston’s Faneuil Hall – renowned as a “cradle
   of liberty” for its role as a protest hub in the run-up to the American
   revolution – felt like a nightmarish end of the road for some aspirant
   new Americans who had turned up full of hope.

   Before proceedings at this month’s event got under way, staff from the
   US Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) asked arrivals expecting
   to swear the oath of allegiance that would finally confirm them as
   citizens to state their country of origin.

   deportations in the US

   Those from nations included on a travel ban list announced by Donald
   Trump last summer were then excluded from taking part, despite having
   completed the years-long vetting process.

   Among the disappointed was a Haitian nursing assistant in her 50s who
   had lived in the US for nearly 25 years – denied what immigration
   specialists say is her legal right by a sudden policy change introduced
   by the Trump administration on “security” grounds.

   The woman declined an interview request. But Gail Breslow, executive
   director of Boston-based Project Citizenship – which had helped guide
   her citizenship application – said she was left devastated and
   distraught.

   “Our client hadn’t received USCIS’s written notification on time and
   turned up expecting to become a citizen,” Breslow said. “She told us
   she was not alone in this and the same thing happened to others.

   “The image of officers going down a line and asking people where they
   were born, and based on the answer that they gave, pulling them out of
   line and sending them home is gut-wrenching.

   “We had another client there the same day from Honduras who was allowed
   to take part and sent us pictures of his naturalization. People are
   holding little flags and it’s a image of pride and joy as people are
   surrounded by family members – the contrast between that and people
   being plucked out of line based on what country they’re from is the
   most un-American image I can conjure.”

   The scene has been replicated in venues elsewhere in response to a
   USCIS memorandum sent out on 5 December instructing that immigration
   proceedings be paused for the nationals of 19 countries on Trump’s ban
   list.

   The memo followed the shooting on 26 November of two national guard
   troops in Washington DC, allegedly by an Afghan national, Rahmanullah
   Lakanwal, who had been granted asylum earlier this year by the Trump
   administration.

   “In light of identified concerns and the threat to the American people,
   USCIS has determined that a comprehensive re-review, potential
   interview, and re-interview of all aliens from high-risk countries of
   concern who entered the United States on or after January 20, 2021 is
   necessary,” read the memo, which cites the shooting of the national
   guards as a justification for the review.

   The memo prompted a flood of emails to applicants awaiting
   naturalization informing them that the ceremonies had been canceled.

   “This is to advise you that, due to unforeseen circumstances, we have
   had to cancel the previously scheduled Oath Ceremony on Wednesday,
   December 03,2025 at 12:30PM for the above applicant,” one typical email
   seen by the Guardian read. “We regret any inconvenience this may
   cause.”

   Advocacy groups report oath ceremonies being called off in
   Philadelphia, New York, Los Angeles, Miami, Milwaukee, Houston, St
   Louis, Omaha and elsewhere.

   “We have seen these cases now in over 16 cities, affecting
   nationalities that include Iranians, Haitian, Sudanese, Yemen,
   Venezuelan, Afghan, Sierra Leonean, Guinean, Libyan, just to name
   quickly some of the countries [proscribed],” said Greg Chen, senior
   director for government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers
   Association.

   of fear

   Prohibitions also apply to green-card applicants and those applying for
   naturalization but who have not yet reached the stage of taking the
   oath of allegiance.

   “We’re talking about [the cancellation of] three types of things –
   green-card interviews, naturalization interviews and then … an oath
   ceremony where it’s kind of finalized,” said Chen.

   Most of those affected refuse to speak to the media, fearing that
   publicity could make them targets for reprisals or raids carried out by
   Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents enforcing Trump’s
   immigration agenda, which has been marked by mass deportations of
   undocumented people.

   However, a Libyan doctor – emailing the Guardian anonymously at the
   request of his lawyer – said his green-card application had been halted
   despite having worked in the US for 10 years after entering on an
   O-1/EB-1 (extraordinary ability) visa.

   “I never imagined that in the United States I would be targeted because
   of my nationality and religious background, particularly by the
   authorities,” wrote the doctor, whose medical work is focused on
   developing AI diagnostic and treatment tools for lung cancer.

   “I invested years of relentless effort in this journey … I pursued the
   American dream in good faith, believing in this country as a land of
   opportunity.

   “Now, as I reach the final stages of my permanent residency process, an
   expensive and lengthy process, my future appears jeopardized solely
   because of my country of origin. I can’t describe to you the
   uncertainty, fear, disappointment and confusion I feel right now.”

   Such feelings are commonplace among groups suddenly fearing their path
   to citizenship is shutting.

   “We’ve had clients in tears asking us, what did they do wrong,” said
   Breslow of Project Citizenship, which has seen 21 clients receive oath
   ceremony cancellations and more than 200 being paused at an earlier
   stage. “What did they do to deserve this? People are very distraught.”

   Emotions are running particularly high among Afghans, nearly 200,000 of
   whom arrived in the US under the Biden administration’s Operation
   Allies Welcome program that followed the 2021 military withdrawal from
   Afghanistan. Many now feel singled out and betrayed after the national
   guard shootings, according to advocates.

   “We feel guilt and shame that that guy was part of our community,” said
   Fatima Saidi, director of We Are All America, a refugee and immigrants
   group. “But he was also a part of American militarism. He joined the US
   army when he was 15 and was trained.”

   In fact, Lakanwal was part of an Afghan unit that operated under CIA
   direction.

   “We also feel guilty for other communities because policies that are
   targeting Afghans are also affecting them,” she added. “But the other
   thing is just hopelessness and disappointment, especially among the
   Afghans who came here as allies. Most of them feel they have done so
   much for America, the veterans and the state department.”

   Nicole Melaku, executive director of the National Partnership for New
   Americans, said the collective demonizing of legal residents and
   citizenship applicants had ominous portents.

   “The strategy of the administration began with an assault on
   undocumented immigrants, and now he [Trump] is going after those with
   legal status and trying to move them into his deportation pipeline
   through administrative processes,” she said.

   “Everything here feels like part of a larger, ominous agenda to have
   exclusion, going back to times where we had the Chinese Exclusion Act
   or other operations in the 1940s like sending people back to Mexico.”

   Her warning was given added weight by guidance issued last week to
   USCIS field offices that signalled a forthcoming assault on the
   citizenship of Americans already naturalized.

   Trump

   The new guidance instructed offices to “supply Office of Immigration
   Litigation with 100-200 denaturalization cases per month” during the
   2026 fiscal year, the New York Times reported, targets that would
   amount to a massive escalation of denaturalization cases. By
   comparison, only 120 were filed from 2017 to 2025.

   Federal law mandates that citizenship can only be withdrawn if holders
   committed fraud while applying. But a justice department memo sent to
   its civil division last June ordered denaturalization cases to be
   prioritized and appeared to lay down broader parameters.

   “It says they’re going to prioritize denaturalization cases against
   people who furthered criminal gangs, people who committed felonies that
   were not disclosed, and people who engaged in fraud against private
   individuals,” an immigration policy expert, speaking on condition of
   anonymity, said. “Those categories don’t require criminal convictions.

   “Only certain cases can be denaturalized under the law, although this
   administration is trying to stretch the parameters of what that means.

   “People who have had their naturalization interviews and ceremonies
   canceled … and then also stripping citizenship from already naturalized
   Americans – they’re like two halves of the same coin to make more of
   our community members subject to detention and deportation.”
