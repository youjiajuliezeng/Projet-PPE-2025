   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- A few days before the NCAA women's volleyball
   national championship, Texas A&M opposite hitter Logan Lednicky posted
   an old family video on her Instagram account. Lednicky is maybe 5 or 6
   years old in the video, wearing a maroon A&M shirt and doing cartwheels
   on the grass at Kyle Field, A&M's football stadium. "Say 'Gig 'Em,
   Aggies,'" her mom, Leigh Lednicky, implores her, and little Logan walks
   up to the camera, smiles and gives a thumbs-up.

   Under the video, Lednicky wrote that she is living in that little
   Aggie's "answered prayers."

   Her dad, Kyle, was a long snapper for the Texas A&M football team in
   the 1990s, and her mom worked in the football office. She chose Texas
   A&M because she always dreamed of being a fourth-generation Aggie, but
   that was only part of it. She wanted to help build a middling
   volleyball program into a powerhouse.

   Lednicky went beyond that little girl's dreams Sunday, swatting 11
   kills to lead Texas A&M to a sweep over No. 1 seed Kentucky for the
   program's first national title. The senior from Sugar Land, Texas, was
   a linchpin in the Aggies' improbable December postseason run, helping
   her team knock off three No. 1 seeds in the NCAA tournament.

   the Texas A&M program, but the national championship was "beyond my
   wildest dreams." Scott Winters/Icon Sportswire

   In the final four matches of her career, when it mattered most,
   Lednicky amassed 69 total kills, a team high. She's one of four seniors
   who have been with the program from the beginning -- they went 13-16 as
   freshmen -- and set the tone for the historic season. The past and
   present swirled through that class Sunday. With the Aggies cruising in
   the final set, coach Jamie Morrison high-fived Lednicky, and hung on to
   her hand.

   "I think she had that moment where, 'This might be the last four points
   of my college career,'" Morrison said. "I think she actually started
   getting a little teary on the court. I was like, 'Oh, no, did I just
   ruin everything?' No, it means the world.

   "There was a group of them here from the beginning that said, 'I want
   to be a part of this, I want to build this program.' ... I don't think
   they were envisioning a national championship by the time they were
   done. I think when we were selling what we were doing, it was building
   something they could come back to in the future and be really, really
   proud they helped build."

   It was Lednicky who helped save the season on Dec. 13 in the Sweet 16,
   when the Aggies were down two sets to Louisville. She hammered a
   team-high 20 kills in a reverse sweep, and afterward, Lednicky
   mentioned a random note that someone left on the scorer's table as her
   team was teetering toward elimination.

   The note said, "Something great is about to happen."

   She has always been the charismatic optimist -- the one who keeps
   things loose. Teammates call her everything from their "ride-or-die" to
   a best friend.

   She has been a recruiter. When Morgan Perkins hit the transfer portal
   after her freshman season at Oklahoma three years ago, her first text
   came from Lednicky, an old club teammate. Perkins said the text was
   something along the lines of, "Hey, Mo-Mo, I see you're in the portal
   ..."

   Lednicky, along with sophomore Kyndal Stowers, helped pull A&M together
   when the Wildcats sprinted out to a 15-9 lead in the first set. The
   Aggies later said they dealt with some jitters at the start of the
   match, but it was short-lived. Lednicky's kill drew A&M within one, and
   then she teamed up with Perkins for a block that tied the game.
   Stowers' kill completed the rally and gave the Aggies the set, 26-24.

   From there, the Aggies dominated. They took a commanding 19-8 lead in
   the second and pulled away in the third with a Lednicky kill that made
   it 18-11.

   "I was pretty emotional all day today," Lednicky said, "just knowing
   that no matter the outcome of this game, it would be my last getting to
   represent A&M on my chest. Being able to do this with these girls --
   end like this, I just can't even believe it.

   "I'm so happy I get to carry this with me through the rest of my life
   and remember all the memories with these girls."

   In the waning moments of the match, a corner of the arena chanted, "Why
   not us?" It became a slogan for the Aggies in the postseason, during
   the match against Louisville. Late Sunday, Lednicky gave a shoutout to
   her boyfriend and teammate Ava Underwood's boyfriend for coining it for
   the Aggies at a concession stand in Lincoln, Nebraska.

   "We kind of took it and ran with it," she said. "We started saying it.
   Ava and Addi (Applegate) wrote it on their shoe. Now it's on a T-shirt
   somehow. Shout out to them.

   "But, I mean, it's true. It's a testament to the hard work this program
   has put in all year long, staff, players. That's such a great
   statement. 'Why not us' has turned into, 'It is us'. I think with that
   dawg mentality all season long, all tournament long, we knew it was
   going to be us."

   Morrison, who came to A&M in December 2022 and overhauled the program's
   culture, figured it would take at least five years to win it all. He
   credited the rapid ascent to his team's work ethic.

   Kyle Lednicky waited for his daughter after the match, marveling over
   how she and her teammates set out to change a program and did it so
   quickly, and dramatically. He said former A&M football coach R.C.
   Slocum texted her Sunday morning and wished her luck.

   "That was pretty cool," Kyle Lednicky said.

   Of course he always hoped his daughter would go to his alma mater, but
   he says he never put pressure on her. Maybe it was osmosis, that all
   those football games, and that maroon clothing, would eventually seep
   into her consciousness, and her heart. It didn't matter. That
   fourth-generation Aggie is now a first-generation champion.

   Kyle Lednicky saw his daughter's Instagram post Thursday, and it
   brought back a flood of memories.

   "I had to put it away," he said, "because I got teary-eyed when I was
   looking at it."
