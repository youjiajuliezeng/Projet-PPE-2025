Astronaut from MD achieves childhood dream of traveling to space

   [play-icon.png] Listen to this article

   Key Takeaways:
     * Potomac native Chris Williams launched to the International Space
       Station last month for an eight-month mission.
     * The MIT astrophysics researcher is conducting stem cell and
       artificial intelligence research aboard the ISS.
     * Williams credits Montgomery County Public Schools and Blair High
       School for nurturing his passion for science.
     * The astronaut says viewing Earth from space underscores its
       fragility and global interconnectedness.

   While most Americans spent Thanksgiving Day gathered around a table
   with family and friends, feet firmly planted on the ground, one
   Maryland-raised man spent the day journeying to the stars.

   Chris Williams, who grew up in Potomac, has been an astrophysics
   researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a clinical
   physicist at Harvard Medical School. He has helped build a
   low-frequency radio telescope array in Western Australia, studied
   supernovas at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory in D.C. and
   volunteered as an emergency medical technician and firefighter.

   But Williams always dreamed of going to space, floating weightless and
   seeing the Earth as a tiny blue ball.

   Last month, the 42-year-old father of two took off from Kazakhstan in a
   spacecraft headed for the International Space Station. He’ll be in
   space for about eight months. The crew is doing stem cell research and
   working with artificial intelligence, among other things.

   After settling in at the ISS, Williams talked with The Washington Post
   this month about how the start of his time in space is going and how it
   feels to shoot for the stars and finally reach them.

   This interview has been edited and condensed.

   Q: What made you want to become an astronaut?

   A: I mean, I actually don’t know. When I was a little kid, I was always
   fascinated by exploration and in particular, space. I think it’s one of
   those things that a lot of kids have fascinations with. So it was
   something I dreamed about as a kid and never let go.

   Q: Your parents told me “Star Trek” was a big inspiration for you.

   A: Absolutely. Growing up, we didn’t watch a lot of TV, but that was
   one of the shows that we watched sort of together as a family. I think
   that the ethos they express on “Star Trek,” of wanting to explore for
   the benefit of all, that’s certainly something that’s really imprinted
   on me and something I firmly believe in.

   Q: How does it feel physically to be up there? I know you trained for
   it, but I’m sure that it’s different.

   A: It’s definitely different. Being weightless and in microgravity,
   it’s a super interesting experience. I think it took me a couple days
   for my brain to kind of get used to it. You work in three dimensions.
   So we have lockers and drawers and experiments that are on the walls,
   but are also on the ceilings and on the floor. …

   It’s been an interesting experience seeing how your brain adapts to
   being in this weightless environment. And it is a lot of fun to fly
   around and let go of things and have them float.

   Q: Will you get to do a spacewalk?

   A: We have some spacewalks on the schedule coming up in January, and
   I’m hoping that I’ll be able to go out and be a part of that. I think
   that’ll be a really great experience.

   Q: Is there a tiny part of you that’s a little scared to walk in space?

   A: When it’s something you train so much for, you understand the risks,
   but you also understand all the things we’re doing to mitigate those
   risks. When you have a deep understanding of what’s all going into it,
   at least for me, that helps take a lot of those fearful emotions out of
   it.

   Q: I wanted to ask how your experience with the Montgomery County
   schools fostered your interest in space?

   A: I do not think I would be where I am today without the upbringing I
   had in Montgomery County, in particular, the fabulous public school
   system. I felt like growing up I had so many opportunities to pursue my
   interest in science. I went to Blair High School, which just had
   fantastic opportunities to really push my passion for science and to
   give me the opportunities to really explore what it would look like to
   be a scientist.

   I was also able to take advantage of the fact that there are a ton of
   wonderful opportunities with federal research labs. As a high-schooler,
   I was able to do astronomy research at the Navy Research Lab in D.C.

   One other thing that I think is pretty special about Montgomery County
   is its diversity, the fact that you’re surrounded by people who come
   from all over. In the International Space Station, we’re a
   collaboration of 15 different countries. And my work every day involves
   interfacing with people from all across the world. Growing up in
   Montgomery County, you get really comfortable with that, which is
   really, really wonderful.

   Q: What are you doing in your downtime up there? Do you have downtime?

   A: We’re pretty busy up here, but we do have a little bit of downtime.
   Most of the time, I try to call my friends and family. One of the
   challenges is that even though we are only 240 miles above the surface
   of the Earth, we’re still pretty far away. And I’m going to be up here
   for an eight-month mission. So staying connected with my friends and
   family back home, and my daughters is really important to me.

   The other thing that’s really nice to do is to … look out the window.
   Pretty incredible views from out here.

   Q: What does it look like?

   A: That’s one of the things that just doesn’t disappoint. You see these
   fabulous pictures of what the Earth looks like from space, and that’s
   what your view out the window looks like every day. You can see huge
   swaths of the world moving by, the view of city lights at night or just
   the wonderful natural beauty of Earth.

   Q: What does that do to your perspective?

   A: I think the biggest emotion for me when I look out the window is
   this sense of how everybody that I care about and know and love is on
   this thing that I can see the whole extent of and … just how small and
   fragile Earth looks. That really leaves an impression on you.
