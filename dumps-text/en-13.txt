Commentary: Living in the Shadow of the American Dream

   A father’s reflections on the quiet, unseen struggles of working
   families today.

   The author with his family on their farm in Shenandoah County,
   Virginia. (Photo provided by the author)

   I live in Shenandoah County, Virginia. I’m a factory worker. A farmer.
   A father of two
   girls, one still in diapers. I get up before the sun, and most days I
   don’t sit down until
   after it’s gone.

   My partner Hannah and I raise our girls on a small farm in the Valley.
   She works
   full-time too-though nobody calls it that. She’s a caregiver, a
   homemaker, a livestock
   handler, and a mother. She doesn’t get a paycheck. She doesn’t get a
   break. She
   doesn’t get counted.

   We’ve relied on a cistern for water for over three years. I’m trying to
   save up to dig a
   well before it runs dry. We heat with firewood I cut myself. We raise
   animals for milk,
   eggs, and meat because the grocery bill outpaces my paycheck.

   We’ve stayed unmarried—not because we don’t love each other, but
   because getting
   married would kick my partner and our daughters off the Medicaid that
   keeps them
   healthy.

   My employer offers insurance, sure—but only if I pay nearly as much as
   our mortgage. I
   can’t, so we stay as we are; in love but locked out.

   I’m not ashamed of our life. It’s honest work, and it’s full of love.
   However, I am ashamed that in a country as wealthy as ours, people like
   us are left out in the cold.

   When the so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” passed, it was marketed as a
   win for working
   Americans. From where I stand, it looks like the opposite. Cuts to
   Medicaid, reduced
   support for struggling families, and a ballooning deficit that somehow
   still leaves us
   more exposed than before.

   You can dress it up however you want, but if it leaves working families
   behind, it’s not
   serving the people.

   This bill, like so many before it, rewards the already powerful while
   punishing the
   people who hold up the economy in invisible ways. It gives to those who
   lobby and
   takes from those who labor. It reinforces a message I’ve felt in my
   bones for years:
   You’re on your own.

   I’m not writing this as a Democrat or a Republican. I’m writing this as
   a man watching
   families like mine wear themselves thin; working hard, doing the right
   things, and still
   falling behind.

   This isn’t about Red or Blue. It’s about the fact that we’re being
   divided against each
   other while both sides forget that real Americans bleed the same when
   the cost of
   insulin triples or the cost of groceries goes up again.

   You shouldn’t be able to carry a hundred dollars’ worth of groceries in
   two hands. But
   these days, you can-and that’s not just wrong, it’s dangerous.

   I’m writing to ask one simple thing: Who is this country really for?

   Because if it’s not for parents doing their best to raise good kids in
   a broken system…
   If it’s not for factory workers and farmers who show up every day, no
   matter how little
   is left in the tank…
   If it’s not for families trying to make a life from the land and a
   paycheck…
   Then maybe the flag doesn’t wave for all of us after all.

   I don’t want handouts. I want fairness. I don’t want politics. I want
   policy that works.

   I don’t want a revolution of violence. I want a revolution of
   responsibility-one where we
   take care of each other, where people can raise a family without
   choosing between
   groceries and medicine, and where love doesn’t have to take a back seat
   to red tape.

   So, if you’re in power, hear me: We are not okay. We are drowning
   quietly.

   And if you’re not in power, but you’re reading this and nodding along,
   then know this:
   you’re not alone either.

   We’re not enemies. We’re neighbors.We’re parents, workers, and
   caretakers. And it’s time we start acting like it.

   With respect,
   A father holding faith

       Amen to a man and woman who are courageous, smart, responsible,
       caring and respectful people who understand what our country should
       be. A country that cares for one another and should be representing
       all of its citizens.

       I’m with you, brother! I’m old enough to remember when the
       democrats were for working families and I wish they could find
       their way back to that. In the meantime, thanks for speaking out!
