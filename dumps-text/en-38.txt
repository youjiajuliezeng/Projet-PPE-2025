Dream of the Desert redefines luxury travel in Saudi Arabia with the Middle

   Saudi Arabia is redefining luxury travel with Dream of the Desert, a
   high-end train offering world-class interiors, cultural highlights, and
   economic growth

   31 December, 2025

   With an ambition to redefine luxury travel in the Middle East, Saudi
   Arabia is preparing to launch Dream of the Desert, a rail experience
   scheduled to debut in 2026.

   Initially announced in 2024, the project brings together Saudi Arabia
   Railways, the Ministry of Culture, and the Saudi Tourism Authority,
   along with the Italian company Arsenale, known for the La Dolce Vita
   Orient Express, to advance the Kingdom's long-distance travel through
   lavish, premium, and culturally driven experiences.

   With this in mind, Arsenale is also behind several high-profile
   hospitality projects, including Soho House Roma, Hotel Santavenere in
   Maratea, and a growing collection of Orient Express hotels such as
   Orient Express La Minerva in Rome, Orient Express Palazzo Dona
   Giovannelli in Venice, and the Abbazia di Spineto in Tuscany.

   According to various sources, one of the project's key aims is to
   strengthen Saudi Arabia's position in luxury transport, placing it in
   competition with some of the world's most celebrated luxury trains.
   These include the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express, the Royal Scotsman,
   and the British Pullman.

   Additionally, the initiative will play a key role in promoting
   sustainable economic growth. At the heart of this strategy is
   attracting sustainable foreign investment and promoting tourism as a
   sector capable of generating long-term returns, independent of oil.

   By attracting international visitors from higher-spending markets and
   increasing levels of luxury tourism expenditure, the initiative is
   expected to raise national income and create multi-sector economic
   opportunities. This assessment is supported by a report from GCC
   Railway, a website specialising in transport and economic development.

Ultra-luxury design onboard

   In terms of design, Dream of the Desert will feature 31 stylish suites,
   including two presidential suites, for up to 66 guests, with two
   restaurants serving Saudi and international cuisine with an Italian
   touch, and cocktails in the Majlis lounge.

   Furthermore, the 14-car train features vintage Italian carriages
   redesigned for modern luxury, offering an ultra-luxury experience
   comparable to Japan's Seven Stars of Kyushu and Malaysia's Eastern &
   Oriental Express.

   Turning to the routes, operators confirmed earlier this month that
   pre-reservations are open for five itineraries, each showcasing a
   different aspect of Saudi Arabia's cultural and natural heritage.

   One of the flagship routes, The Northern Sands, is a three-day journey
   from Riyadh to Al Jouf. The itinerary includes visits to Marid Castle,
   the ancient rock carvings of Jubbah, and an overnight desert
   experience.

   Another itinerary, A Taste of AlUla, runs from Riyadh to AlUla, with
   stops in Al Jouf and Jubbah along the way. The journey features bespoke
   programming developed in collaboration with AlUla Destination.

   Shorter options are also available for travellers seeking a more
   compact experience. Whispers of Jubbah is a two-day itinerary focused
   on the prehistoric carvings of Jubbah and a visit to Diriyah. Ramadan
   Nights is a seasonal journey, with iftar and suhoor served onboard in
   the desert, followed by stargazing.

   Meanwhile, Summer Mirage offers a two-day return journey from Riyadh,
   featuring themed events and dining tailored for summer travel.

Aligning with Vision 2030 goals

   As energy economist Nihad Ismail puts it, the project is one of the
   strategic pillars of Saudi Vision 2030, an ambitious tourism and
   transport initiative aimed at diversifying the economy and reducing
   dependence on fossil fuels.

   Nihad also noted that the train is the first of its kind in the Middle
   East in terms of luxury and high-end design, drawing comparisons with
   Europe's famous Orient Express.

   Nihad added that the project's significance lies in its close alignment
   with the core objectives of Vision 2030, particularly those focused on
   attracting 150 million visitors to the Kingdom by the end of the decade
   and positioning Saudi Arabia as a global destination for tourism and
   investment.

   Expanding on this point, Nihad explained that Dream of the Desert is
   not just a mode of transport but a fully integrated tourism experience,
   with its first journeys expected to begin in the final quarter of 2026,
   departing from Riyadh and travelling toward Jordan's southern border.
   Covering approximately 1,300 kilometres, the route passes through areas
   of tourism, historical, and cultural significance.

   According to Nihad, this corridor presents a valuable opportunity to
   promote domestic destinations and connect them through a luxury
   transport network, further enhancing the Kingdom's appeal as a regional
   and global tourism destination.

A strategic tourism vision

   Weighing in on the project's significance, Ali Metwally, an economist
   at a London-based consultancy, told The New Arab that Dream of the
   Desert represents both a symbolic and strategic step. He said it should
   not be viewed as a form of mass transportation, but rather as a
   high-end tourism and entertainment product.

   Because of its luxurious positioning and limited capacity, Ali further
   explained that the project's direct impact on mass transport providers
   is likely to be limited. Instead, it is expected to target
   high-spending visitors who typically rely on domestic aviation or
   private transport rather than traditional land-based services.

   However, he believes the project could help reposition the land
   transport sector over the medium term. Ali said some operators may
   adapt by acting as feeder services to railway stations or by focusing
   on more economical travel segments, while luxury rail offerings cater
   to the high-end tourism market.

   From an economic perspective, Ali argued that the project's impact
   extends beyond simply replacing one mode of transport with another. He
   identified three key areas where its influence could be felt.

   The first relates to maximising the economic value of each tourist.
   Rather than being confined to one or two cities, travellers will move
   along a long geographic corridor that includes natural, historical, and
   heritage sites.

   According to Ali, this is likely to extend visitor stays and increase
   spending on accommodation, local activities and services along the
   route, contributing positively to non-oil tourism income.

   The second area concerns the project's role in shaping a new image of
   Saudi Arabia as a diverse, high-end tourism destination.

   Ali said this positioning moves beyond Umrah, Hajj and urban tourism to
   include distinctive experiences such as luxury train journeys through
   the desert, strengthening the Kingdom's tourism brand and appealing to
   visitors with high purchasing power.

   The third area concerns the broader transformation of the transport
   sector, with Ali noting that Dream of the Desert is part of a national
   strategy to expand the railway network and improve the overall quality
   of life.
