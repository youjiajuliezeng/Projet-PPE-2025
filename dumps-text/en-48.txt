A Venezuelan family's Christmas: From the American dream to poverty

   MARACAY, Venezuela -- This was not the Christmas that Mariela Gómez
   would have imagined a year ago. Or the one that thousands of other
   Venezuelan immigrants would have thought. But Donald Trump returned to
   the White House in January and quickly ended their American dream.

   So Gómez found herself spending the holiday in northern Venezuela for
   the first time in eight years. She dressed up, cooked, got her son a
   scooter and smiled for her in-laws. Hard as she tried, though, she
   could not ignore the main challenges faced by returning migrants:
   unemployment and poverty.

   “We had a modest dinner, not quite what we’d hoped for, but at least we
   had food on the table,” Gómez said of the lasagna-like dish she shared
   with her partner and in-laws instead of the traditional Christmas dish
   of stuffed corn dough hallacas. “Making hallacas here is a bit
   expensive, and since we’re unemployed, we couldn’t afford to make
   them.”

   Gómez, her two sons and her partner returned to the city of Maracay on
   Oct. 27 after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border to Texas, where they were
   quickly swept up by U.S. Border Patrol amid the Trump administration’s
   crackdown on immigration. They were deported to Mexico, from where they
   began the dangerous journey back to Venezuela.

   They crossed Central America by bus, but once in Panama, the family
   could not afford to continue to Colombia via boat in the Caribbean.
   Instead, they took the cheaper route along the Pacific’s choppy waters,
   sitting on top of sloshing gasoline tanks in a cargo boat for several
   hours and then transferring to a fast boat until reaching a jungled
   area of Colombia. They spent about two weeks there until they were
   wired money to make it to the border with Venezuela.

   Gómez was among the more than 7.7 million Venezuelans who left their
   home country in the last decade, when its economy came undone as a
   result of a drop in oil prices, corruption and mismanagement. She lived
   in Colombia and Peru for years before setting her sights on the U.S.
   with hopes of building a new life.

   Trump’s second term has dashed the hopes of many like Gómez.

   As of September, more than 14,000 migrants, mostly from Venezuela, had
   returned to South America since Trump moved to limit migration to the
   U.S., according to figures from Colombia, Panama and Costa Rica. In
   addition, Venezuelans were steadily deported to their home country this
   year after President Nicolás Maduro, under pressure from the White
   House, did away with his long-standing policy of not accepting
   deportees from the U.S.

   Immigrants arrived regularly at the airport outside the capital,
   Caracas, on flights operated by a U.S. government contractor or
   Venezuela’s state-owned airline. More than 13,000 immigrants returned
   this year on the chartered flights.

   Gómez’s return to Venezuela also allowed her to see the now 20-year-old
   daughter she left behind when she fled the country’s complex crisis.
   They talked and drank beer during the holiday knowing it might be the
   last time they share a drink for a while — Gómez’s daughter will
   migrate to Brazil next month.

   Gómez is hoping to make hallacas for New Year’s Eve and is also hoping
   for a job. But her prayers for next year are mostly for good health.

   “I ask God for many things, first and foremost life and health, so we
   can continue enjoying our family,” she said.
