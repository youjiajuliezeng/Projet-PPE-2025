   Verywell / Brianna Gilmartin

   We spend roughly one-third of our lives sleeping—and during that time,
   we dream. Many theories exist to explain why we dream, but researchers
   still don't know for sure. Some believe dreams have symbolic meaning,
   whereas others believe that they relate to waking life.

   What scientists do know is that just about everyone dreams every time
   they sleep, and those dreams can be fascinating, exciting, terrifying,
   or just plain weird.

   Most of those dreams are forgotten within minutes of waking. Most
   people dream in color, but some dream in black and white. Our dream
   content can also differ from one person to the next, and some people
   can control what they dream about as if they were writing the script.
   If you've ever wondered what makes dreams so fascinating and sometimes
   strange, exploring some dream facts can help you gain greater insight
   into this state of consciousness.

We Dream Every Night

   The brain is active all night long. Brain activity in the forebrain and
   midbrain is particularly intense during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep,
   which is when we dream.

   Adults and babies alike dream for around two hours per night, even if
   they don't remember it. In fact, researchers have found that people
   usually have several dreams each night, each typically lasting for five
   to 20 minutes.

   During a typical lifetime, people spend an average of six years
   dreaming.
   When Dreams Merge With Your Waking Life—What to Know About Deja Reve

We Forget Most of Our Dreams

7 Theories on Why We Dream Simplified

   We forget up to 95% of all dreams shortly after waking.

   According to one theory about why dreams are so difficult to remember,
   changes in the brain during sleep don't support the information
   processing and storage needed to form memories.

   Brain scans of sleepers have shown that the frontal lobes—the area that
   plays a key role in memory formation—are inactive during REM sleep, the
   stage in which dreaming occurs.

   We might also forget our dreams because of changes in the levels of
   certain neurotransmitters, specifically acetylcholine and
   norepinephrine, during REM sleep.

   Yet another study found a link between dream recall and the brain
   matter density of the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). Participants
   with higher white matter density were more likely to recall their
   dreams.

Not All Dreams Are in Color

   According to a 2017 study, around 50% of people report dreaming in
   color almost all of the time. However, they also suggested they dream
   in black and white around 10% of the time. An older 2008 study
   suggested that roughly 12% of people dream only in black-and-white.

   People younger than 25 rarely report dreaming in black and white.
   However, people older than 55 report black-and-white dreams about 25%
   of the time. Researchers believe this difference results from childhood
   exposure to black-and-white television. An older study, which found
   that people in the 1940s rarely reported dreaming in color, supports
   this idea.

Men and Women Dream Differently

   Researchers have also found differences between men and women in dream
   content. In several studies, men reported dreaming about weapons
   significantly more often than women did, whereas women dreamed about
   clothing more often than men.

   Another study showed that men's dreams tend to have more aggressive
   content and physical activity, whereas women's dreams contain more
   rejection and exclusion, as well as more conversation than physical
   activity.

   Women tend to have slightly longer dreams with more characters. Men
   dream about other men twice as often as they do about women; women tend
   to dream about both sexes equally. Women also report having more
   nightmares than men.

Animals Probably Dream

   Many think that, when a sleeping dog wags its tail or a sleeping cat
   swats its paws, it's dreaming. Although no one can say for sure,
   researchers believe that most animals go through REM and non-REM sleep
   stages, so they probably do dream.

   Animals might not experience dreams in the same way as humans, however.
   In other words, they might not remember images or attach a storyline to
   them.

You Can Control Your Dreams

   A lucid dream is one in which you're aware that you're dreaming even
   though you're still asleep.

   Lucid dreaming is thought to be a combination of consciousness and REM
   sleep, during which you can direct or control the dream content.

   People can learn how to have lucid dreams using various techniques,
   including mnemonic induction of lucid dreams (MILD) and
   senses-initiated lucid dreams (SSILD). These involve waking up after
   five hours and repeating a phrase like "I will remember my dream" or
   focusing on the stimuli (sights, sounds, sensations) in your sleep
   environment, respectively.

   Approximately half of all people can remember at least one instance of
   lucid dreaming, and some are able to have lucid dreams frequently.

Negative Dreams Are More Common

   Researcher Calvin S. Hall, collected more than 50,000 dream accounts
   from college students over more than 40 years. Made available to the
   public in the 1990s by Hall's student, William Domhoff, the dream
   accounts reported many emotions during dreams.

   Several factors affect the emotional content of dreams, including
   anxiety, stress, and certain medications. Research has found that
   external stimuli, including good and bad smells, can play a role in
   positive and negative dreams.

   The most common emotion experienced in dreams is anxiety. Generally,
   negative emotions are much more common than positive ones.
   How to Interpret Your Dreams

Blind People May Dream Visually

   In one study of people who have been blind since birth, they still
   seemed to experience visual imagery in their dreams, and they had eye
   movements that correlated to visual dream recall.

   Although they had fewer eye movements during REM sleep than the sighted
   participants, the blind participants reported the same dream
   sensations, including visual content.

You're Paralyzed While Dreaming

   REM sleep is characterized by paralysis of the voluntary muscles. This
   phenomenon is known as REM atonia and prevents you from acting out your
   dreams while you're asleep. Basically, because motor neurons are not
   stimulated, your body does not move.

   In some cases, this paralysis can even carry over into the waking state
   for as long as 10 minutes, a condition known as sleep paralysis.

   Although the experience can be frightening, it's perfectly normal and
   should last only a few minutes before normal muscle control returns.

Some Dreams Are Universal

   Although dreams are often influenced by personal experiences and may
   serve important adaptive functions. People across the globe report
   having similar themes in their dreams, although there may be
   differences based on their unique cultural experiences and
   environments.

   For example, people from all over the world frequently dream about
   being chased, being attacked, or falling. Other common dream
   experiences include feeling frozen and unable to move, arriving late,
   flying, and being naked in public.
   Why You Get Vivid Dreams and How to Stop Them

Takeaways

   Dreams can range from the fascinating to the anxiety-provoking to the
   just plain weird. You might wake up scratching your head and wondering
   "Why did I dream about *that*? While there's a lot we still don't know
   about dreaming, we have discovered a number of intriguing facts that
   can provide greater insights into how and why we dream.
