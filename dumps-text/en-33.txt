Scientists break through the wall of sleep to the untapped world of dreams

   NSF-supported researchers achieve two-way communication with lucidly
   dreaming people, creating a new method for studying the human mind that
   might lead to innovative ways of learning and problem-solving.

   "Eight minus six … two"

   It's not exactly "one small step for man," but that humble mathematical
   message is extraordinary in its own way. The first part — "eight minus
   six" — was transmitted by a scientist to a place just as exotic as the
   moon yet frequented by each of us. The response — "two" — came from the
   mind of a sleeping research subject as he snoozed in a neuroscience
   laboratory outside Chicago.

   You see, "eight minus six... two" is a dialogue between two people —
   one of whom was asleep and dreaming.

   "It's authentic communication," says cognitive neuroscientist Ken
   Paller, who oversees the laboratory where this groundbreaking
   communication took place. "It can be done."

   Researchers at Paller's lab at Northwestern University in Illinois,
   along with researchers in France, Germany and the Netherlands, have
   independently demonstrated two-way communication with people as they
   are lucidly dreaming during REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. Supported
   by the U.S. National Science Foundation, the breakthrough was achieved
   in the U.S. by Karen Konkoly, Paller's doctoral student, and
   Christopher Mazurek, a volunteer research participant at the time of
   the study — and one of the first people to ever engage in a real-time
   dialogue from within a dream.

   This discovery holds tantalizing possibilities for expanding our
   understanding of how our minds work. It may even lead to methods that
   could improve our ability to learn difficult skills or solve complex
   problems.

   And, with the help of a new smartphone app from Paller's lab, you could
   even try it at home.

The windows to the soul (and dreams)

   Research into the fundamental nature of dreams, and what the human mind
   can do while dreaming, has been limited by a seemingly unsolvable
   problem: you can't get much information about someone's dream while
   they're actually having the dream. "All we have are the stories people
   tell when they wake up," says Paller. That deficiency has left an
   entire state of consciousness largely unexplored.

   The novel methods pioneered by Konkoly, Paller and their colleagues are
   designed to solve this problem and open entirely new areas of research
   focused on the dreaming mind. Konkoly describes the possibilities:
   "Right now, we conduct psychology experiments with people who are
   awake. With two-way communication [during dreams], we could conduct
   some of the same experiments while people are sleeping. It could really
   expand our view of consciousness and what the mind is capable of."

   But, how can a dreaming research subject communicate if they can't even
   move, let alone speak, while sleeping? The answer requires some
   explanation about what happens in our mind during sleep.

   and eyes are displayed on a computer monitor.

   Scientists have identified the different stages of sleep by monitoring
   electrical signals from the brain using electroencephalography, or EEG,
   and from other places in the body. When the electrical signals are
   recorded and plotted, they chart the course our mind takes as we
   progress through the stages of sleep.

   As you sleep, your mind transitions through several different stages,
   from light sleep to deep sleep and eventually to REM sleep. REM sleep
   is notable not just for what's moving — our eyes — but what isn't.
   Although our mind is active and dreams often occur during REM sleep,
   our bodies are almost completely paralyzed. That presents an obvious
   challenge for communications since we can't move the body parts we
   typically use to communicate. As the name "rapid eye movement"
   suggests, however, there is an exception.

   During REM sleep, our eyes move around behind our eyelids in a
   seemingly random fashion, which often corresponds to the sleeper
   "looking" at various imagined things in their dream. If you dream that
   you're looking at something, your closed eyes move correspondingly as
   if you were looking at something while awake.

   That phenomenon led researchers to a key insight: If eye movement were
   consciously controlled, the dreamer's eyes could become a vehicle for
   getting a message to the waking world.

He's lucid! Let's do math

   Who among us hasn't wished we could fly like a bird? Or walk on another
   planet? So-called lucid dreamers can do these things and more from the
   comfort of their own bed. Accomplished lucid dreamers have reported
   being able to regularly achieve awareness in their dreams and even
   "programming" themselves to have dreams about specific activities or
   locations.

   Christopher Mazurek was not one of those people.

   "I had no experience with lucid dreaming," says Mazurek, an
   undergraduate student at Northwestern University and now research
   assistant in Paller's sleep lab. At the time, he was a volunteer
   research participant. "Before I entered the lab, I never had anything
   near a lucid dream."

   To prepare Mazurek and the other U.S. volunteers, Konkoly wired each
   participant with electrodes that sense brain activity through the
   scalp, behind the ears, on the chin and — critically — near the eyes.
   Those would allow the researchers to monitor and record even slight eye
   movements. "When your eyes move in their sockets, it creates an
   electrical current which is detected by the electrodes and recorded,"
   says Konkoly.

   electrodes on his face will detect the movement of his eyes as he
   sleeps.

   Konkoly also trained each research participant to help them achieve
   lucidity and instructed them on what to do if they succeeded. That
   included learning to recognize the specific sound she would play when
   they entered REM sleep, prompting the participants to realize they're
   dreaming and thus become lucid. The participants also learned the
   distinct response signal they should produce from within their dream:
   moving their eyes from left to right multiple times.

   "Repeatedly looking from left to right is a very distinctive eye
   movement and it stands out from other eye movements during REM sleep,"
   says Konkoly. As she carefully watched the EEG and saw Mazurek
   progressing through the stages of sleep and into REM sleep, she spotted
   the repeating left-right signal on the monitor as Mazurek signaled his
   awareness.

   "He's lucid!" remembers Konkoly. "Let's do math."

   Konkoly played a randomly selected audio recording: "eight minus six."
   Mazurek knew he would be presented with simple math problems but did
   not know which problems would be selected. Some of the international
   labs in the study used different methods to send messages to their
   dreaming subjects, such as flashing lights in Morse code which the
   sleepers could perceive through their closed eyelids and manifest in
   their dream. In most of the labs, the research participants were
   trained to move their "dream eyes" to signal their answer.

   A few seconds later, Konkoly saw Mazurek's response written among the
   peaks and valleys of his eyes' electrical signals: "Two." Konkoly sent
   another randomly selected math problem and once again received a
   correct response. And what was Mazurek dreaming about during this
   groundbreaking exchange between two worlds?

   "I dreamed I was sleeping in the lab when I heard her question," he
   says. Despite that rather mundane dreamscape, "It still blew me away
   how different and intense and odd it all felt. It was different than
   anything I could have imagined."

   Konkoly from his dream. The red shows the distinctive repeating
   left-to-right motion of his eyes as he signals his lucidity twice
   followed by his answer to the math problem: “Two".

   To obtain independent verification of their results, Konkoly sent the
   recorded data to an expert "sleep scorer." Like an astrophysicist who
   can tell you what elements are in a distant star by deciphering the
   colored light recorded in a spectrograph, a sleep scorer is trained to
   "read" the recorded electrical signals and analyze their complex
   patterns. The sleep scorer confirmed that Mazurek was indeed in REM
   sleep during the exchange.

   While Mazurek was the first in Paller's lab to achieve two-way
   communication in a dream, two more participants later accomplished that
   same feat. Meanwhile, researchers in France, Germany and the
   Netherlands were independently testing methods for two-way
   communication in dreams and reported that three additional individuals
   were able to provide correct responses while dreaming. The collective
   results from all the laboratories are now published in the journal
   Current Biology.

Sleep on it

   "Why would you want to do math in your sleep?" quips Konkoly. "I get
   that comment sometimes."

   Joking aside, researchers have a number of ideas for how this discovery
   could be expanded and applied. "There's evidence that lucid dreaming is
   a great place to practice skills compared to when you're awake," says
   Konkoly. "For example, you could slow down time so you could practice a
   skill in more detail or practice something without having any fear of
   the repercussions of failing."

   Imagine a surgeon attempting to perfect a technique used in open heart
   surgery — in a dream.

   "There are many unexplored neurobiological aspects to learning and
   training during REM sleep. But without two-way communication, you can't
   conduct a proper controlled experiment to understand it," she adds.

   "People say 'sleep on it,' when grappling with a hard problem," says
   Paller, in reference to his research published in 2019, which showed
   people who were cued to think about puzzles during sleep exhibited
   substantial improvement in finding solutions. "There's some sense that
   sleep can help you find an answer to a problem that's vexing you. Our
   two-way communication method provides hope for improving that. If
   you're working on a problem, can you be reminded of that problem during
   a dream and come up with a creative answer more easily?

   "From run of the mill personal problems to complex global problems, we
   need creative solutions. If we can help people come up with the answers
   more easily, we should do that," he says.

   Paller's lab has also developed a smartphone app that aims to make it
   easier for people to achieve lucidity, which could enable anyone to
   phone home from the world of dreams without visiting a sleep
   laboratory. You can learn how to get the app and give it a try through
   Paller's cognitive neuroscience website.

   Researchers are working to expand and refine two-way communications
   with sleeping people so more complex conversations may one day be
   possible.

Our full potential

   Although many aspects of the sleeping mind remain a mystery,
   researchers across a variety of scientific disciplines are utilizing
   new techniques and analytical methods to better understand it. "Sleep
   is valuable for our health in ways we've yet to come to grips with,"
   says Paller. For example, neuroscientists at the University of
   California, Berkeley, recently uncovered evidence showing that sleep
   plays a critical role in how our brains flush out beta-amyloid, a toxic
   substance that contributes to the onset of Alzheimer's disease.

   "REM sleep is a unique state of consciousness," adds Konkoly. "We spend
   a lot of time in it and yet no one really understands its full
   potential. We want to know how it works."

   The pioneering work of Konkoly, Paller and their colleagues provides an
   entirely new method that scientists can use to investigate how sleep
   and dreams affect health and mental abilities.

   And who knows? Perhaps the idea of conversing with someone from within
   a dream may one day be as routine as sending a text message on your
   phone:

   "Can I snooze five more minutes? I've almost figured out this
   problem..."
