'How rising costs shattered my restaurant dream'

   [grey-placeholder.png] BBC A woman in a red hooded sweatshirt stands
   inside an empty restaurant. It has no chairs and tables and the bar
   behind her is empty. She has red, shoulder-length, bobbed hair, blue
   eyes and freckles, and is looking at the camera. BBC

   Former restaurant owner Kelly Broderick says hospitality businesses are
   "falling like dominoes" due to increases in costs

   Kelly Broderick wipes away tears as she cleans her restaurant ahead of
   handing the keys back to the landlord.

   After eight years, the Newquay resident says "insurmountable" increases
   in costs - from wages to the price of cooking oil - have led her to
   make the "heartbreaking" decision.

   It comes as Cornwall Chamber of Commerce also warns businesses have
   "nothing left to give" ahead of the Budget on Wednesday.

   The government says "pubs, restaurants and cafes are vital to local
   communities" adding it is cutting the cost of licensing and lowering
   their business rates.

   [grey-placeholder.png] A close-up image of two, street-side restaurant
   signs that are inside the front door of a restaurant. They say The Fish
   Bat, Seafood, Tapas.

   Ms Broderick says she found customers were not "coming out as often or
   spending as much as they did"

   Miss Broderick says she took on personal debt to try and keep her
   business afloat but adds she "can't face the rising costs anymore".

   "Wages, National Insurance contributions, product costs, utilities,
   insurance - everything costs so much more than it used to," she
   continues.

   About 80 meals per evening were served at The Fish Bar - Miss
   Broderick's seafood and tapas restaurant, during the busy summer
   months.

   The business had two full-time employees, an apprentice and about 15
   part-time members of staff.

   "You put your heart and soul into building your dream but everything is
   against you," she explains.

   She says she found customers were not "coming out as often or spending
   as much as they did".

   "We just can't face the rising costs anymore," Kelly Broderick said as
   she packed up her closed restaurant

   "Don't come back and ask businesses for more because there is nothing
   left to give," says John Brown, of the Cornwall Chamber of Commerce, to
   Chancellor Rachel Reeves.

   Speaking at a meeting of the Cornwall Hospitality Collective, he
   explains the government needs to do more to "incentivise businesses to
   grow and hire more people", adding the measures announced in the last
   Budget "had not made things any easier".

   The government says it does not comment on speculation around changes
   to tax outside of fiscal events.

   Simon Mahon, chief executive of Watergate Bay Hotel, says he wants some
   good news from the chancellor.

   "I'm hoping for a cut in business rates for those in hospitality, and
   tax relief for businesses that are investing," he explains.

   Mr Mahon adds he also wants to see a review of the impact of the
   increase in employers' National Insurance contributions, which he says
   have had a "punitive" impact on hospitality and led to jobs being lost.

   "Pubs, restaurants and cafes are vital to local communities, that's why
   we're cutting the cost of licensing, lowering their business rates and
   helping more hospitality businesses offer pavement drinks and al fresco
   dining, on top of cutting alcohol duty on draught pints and capping
   corporation tax," a government spokesperson says.

   They also say 43% of employers (865,000) will pay no employer National
   Insurance contributions this year and that the government is supporting
   businesses with expert advice to cut energy bills and emissions.

   Back at The Fish Bar in Newquay, Kelly Broderick says closing the
   business will also be a "relief after all the stress".

   She adds: "You try and make something successful and it's not viable -
   that's what really hurts."
