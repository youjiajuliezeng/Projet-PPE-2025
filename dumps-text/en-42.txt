   ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY, Md. (7News) — A Maryland mother decided it was
   time to pursue her childhood dream in her early 50s, with encouragement
   from her daughter. After two years of hard work, she graduated from
   nursing school.

   7News Health and Wellness Reporter Victoria Sanchez first met Carrie
   Rodevick and her daughter, Rachel Gwin, in 2023. Sanchez and the
   mother-daughter duo sat inside a classroom at Anne Arundel Community
   College after enrolling in nursing school together.

   "Well, I have always wanted to be a nurse," Rodevick told Sanchez two
   years ago.

   Decades ago, Rodevick got married, had two children, and soon became
   the breadwinner of the family. She thought her dream would remain just
   that.

   “And then with my little catalyst over here who’s like, ‘Just do it,
   mom,'" Rodevick said in 2023, referencing her daughter.

   “My whole life, ever since, I feel like the first time I remember her
   saying it, I was 5 years old, is her saying, ‘I wish I was a nurse,'"
   Gwin said.

   Two years after that interview, Sanchez caught up with Rodevick, who
   had recently graduated with her hard-earned degree.

   “Just finding out what I really can do has been incredible," she said.

   Two days before her 55th birthday, Rodevick walked across the stage at
   Anne Arundel Community College during the pin ceremony.

   "My words of advice are do not think that you do not have it in you to
   realize what is your dream," she said. "And, I would say lean on your
   support, people."

   She accepted a position as a nurse in a hospital cardiology unit and
   started in early January. As for her daughter, she decided to switch
   paths and is currently in school to become a paramedic.
