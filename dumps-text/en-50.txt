The American dream now costs $5 million. Here's a breakdown.

   Anyone, in theory, can attain the American dream. But at what price?

   It now costs $5 million over a lifetime to fund eight key components of
   the American dream, including homeownership and raising children,
   according to a recent analysis from Investopedia.

   Everyone’s dream is different. But some human wants are universal, as
   Investopedia found in compiling its September report.

   In an accompanying survey, the financial journalism site asked 1,263
   adults to identify goals they associate with the American dream. Most
   said they shared these eight aspirations:
     * Retiring in comfort (86%)
     * Affording quality health care (86%)
     * Owning a home (85%)
     * Raising a family (78%)
     * Owning a new car (72%)
     * Going on vacation every year (71%)
     * Caring for pets (66%)
     * Having a wedding (55%)

   The report tabulates the lifetime costs of each goal, tapping data from
   federal agencies, think tanks and industry groups.

   Rethinking the American dream: Trade schools vs. college degrees
   High school students and their parents are considering the benefits of
   trade school versus college.

Here are the costs of achieving the American dream

   Here are the lifetime costs of each goal, from largest to smallest:
     * Retirement: $1.6 million
     * Owning a home: $957,594
     * Owning a new car: $900,346
     * Raising two children and paying for college: $876,092
     * Health care: $414,208
     * Annual vacations: $180,621
     * Pets: $39,381
     * Wedding: $38,200

   Add them up, and you have a lifetime cost of $5,043,323 for achieving
   the American dream.

   That’s a daunting sum, considering the average American with a
   bachelor’s degree earns about $2.8 million over a career.

The American dream is getting more expensive

   On the campaign trail in 2024, presidential candidate Donald Trump
   pledged to "bring back the American dream." 

   The numbers suggest, however, that the dream is getting more expensive.
   Investopedia found that most components of the American dream cost more
   in 2025 than in 2024, when the site last tallied costs.

   “You’re definitely seeing a rise in prices pretty much across the
   board, especially for things like homeownership and raising kids and
   sending them to college,” said Caleb Silver, chief business editor of
   People Inc. and editor-in-chief of Investopedia, speaking to USA TODAY
   in September. 

   A lifetime supply of new cars cost $900,346 in 2025, versus $811,440 a
   year ago, Investopedia found. A lifetime of homeownership costs
   $957,594, up from $929,955.

   Not everyone, however, defines the American dream the same way.

   Michael Strain, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute
   and author of a 2020 book about the American dream, suggests
   Investopedia might have set too high a bar.

   “I’m not sure we should equate the American dream with the lifestyle
   enjoyed by the top 10% of income earners,” he said in a September
   interview.

   To Strain, the American dream is more about a sense of upward
   trajectory: “Are you getting ahead?” he said. “Are you doing better
   year after year? Are your kids going to do better than you’ve done?”

   The point of the Investopedia report, Silver said, is to get people
   thinking about how to finance their own American dream.

   “We hope that people will read this and think about what their dream
   actually is, so they can put a price tag on it and then come up with
   real strategies to be able to earn enough money to achieve it.”

   Here is a detailed cost breakdown of the American dream:

Retirement: $1.6 million 

   According to Investopedia, $1.64 million represents the average cost
   for 20 years of retirement. The tab is based on average annual
   expenditures in retirement.

   A year ago, Investopedia estimated the cost of retirement at just under
   $1.6 million.

   If those numbers seem high, consider that financial advisers often
   instruct retirees to plan on spending only 4% of their savings on
   annual living expenses. And 4% of $1.6 million is only $64,000. 

Homeownership: $957,594 

   That figure reflects the average cost of buying a home and financing it
   with a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, including interest, insurance and
   property taxes.  

   A year ago, Investopedia estimated the cost of homeownership at
   $929,955.

   The median price of an American home is about $415,000, the report
   says. The rest of the lifetime tab represents interest, insurance and
   taxes. 

Owning new cars: $900,346 

   This figure reflects the cost of buying and financing a new car every
   10 years from ages 22 to 75 in a two-car household.

   A year ago, Investopedia estimated the lifetime cost of new-car
   ownership at $811,440.

   Investopedia’s survey found that 72% of Americans consider owning a new
   car a component of the American dream.

   But not everyone agrees. The average vehicle in the United States
   is nearly 13 years old, a record high. 

Raising two kids: $876,092

   That figure covers the costs of raising two children through age 18,
   then paying for each to attend a public college at in-state rates for
   four years.  

   The total cost of raising two children comes to $645,819, Investopedia
   estimates. College expenses push the figure well past $800,000. 

   Those costs partly explain why fewer Americans are  choosing to have
   children.  

Health care: $414,208

   In past American dream reports, Investopedia didn’t include health care
   as a component: It’s a need, not a want, right?

   Americans need health care, but they want quality health care. Most
   survey respondents said access to quality health care is part of their
   American dream.

   The total represents average lifetime health care expenditures from
   ages 22 to 85.

Annual vacations: $180,621

   According to the Investopedia survey, most Americans consider vacations
   a nonnegotiable component of the American dream.

   The figure above represents one vacation a year from ages 22 to 85,
   assuming the average vacation costs $2,867.

   A year ago, Investopedia estimated a lifetime of vacations costs
   $179,109.

Owning pets: $39,381

   Two-thirds of American households have pets, and most of us consider
   our furry friends a key piece of the American dream.

   The figure above represents lifetime costs of owning just one dog and
   one cat, including food and health care.

Having a wedding: $38,200

   More than half of Americans say a wedding is part of the American
   dream. Interestingly, wedding costs have actually declined since
   2024.

   The $38,200 total covers a ceremony, reception and ring.
