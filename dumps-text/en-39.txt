Key Takeaways

     * Dreams can reveal unconscious thoughts, feelings, and desires about
       people.
     * Dreaming of someone does not mean they are thinking about you.
     * Understanding your dreams can help you grow and find peace within
       yourself.

   If you've ever had a dream about someone unexpected, such as an ex,
   co-worker, or crush, you might wonder why they might appear in your
   dreams. While dreams are often centered on daytime thoughts and
   concerns, they can also reflect unconscious thoughts or feelings about
   others. In other cases, dreams symbolically represent something else
   entirely.

   Understanding what dreaming about another person means can provide
   insight into things you may be thinking or worrying about, potentially
   without even realizing it. Read on to start to decode your dreams and
   what they might say about you.

Dreaming About Someone Can Reveal Unconscious Feelings

   The psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud played a significant role in connecting
   dream interpretation to the field of psychology. Freud suggested that
   dreams are one way to access the unconscious mind, which he described
   as a vast reservoir of thoughts, feelings, and desires hidden from
   conscious awareness.

   Even though the contents of the unconscious are not directly
   accessible, Freud still believed that these thoughts, memories, and
   desires could still have an influence on behavior. Freud also believed
   the unconscious could be explored through processes such as dream
   analysis, free association, hypnosis, Freudian slips, and
   psychoanalysis.

   Freud believed that bringing unconscious information to light could
   help alleviate psychological distress. If dreaming about someone has
   left you upset, distressed, or just plain baffled, exploring your
   dream's meaning may help you make sense of what it might mean.

Breaking Down Your Dreams of Someone Else

   According to Jesse Lyon, a licensed mental health counselor and owner
   of Lyon Counseling in Casselberry, Florida, before we can understand
   what it means to dream about someone, it is essential to first
   understand that dreams communicate information on two different levels.
   These levels are known as the manifest content and the latent content.

   Sigmund Freud famously described these two aspects of dreams in his
   seminal book "The Interpretation of Dreams." Freud suggested that
   dreams were highly symbolic and contained literal meanings (the
   manifest content) and symbolic meanings (the latent content).

Manifest Content of Dreams

   The manifest content of a dream refers to the actual events and images
   that take place within the dream. This is the imagery and storyline
   that you remember upon waking. If you dream about someone, the manifest
   content would be the details about that individual, their appearance,
   the events that take place, and the interactions you have within the
   dream.

   "Manifest content is very literal and will communicate with you
   directly about a problem you have or situation you experienced," Lyon
   explains. "For example, you might dream about getting into an argument
   with your romantic partner because you are currently experiencing
   conflict in your relationship; this is pretty straightforward dream
   processing."

   Another example might be having a dream about attending a concert with
   a close friend you haven’t seen in a long time. The manifest content
   would be the events, your friend's words and reactions, and the other
   sensory and perceptual elements you experience as a dreamer.

   The manifest content may not, however, necessarily reflect the
   underlying meaning of the dream. It is through analyzing the latent
   content—or the symbolic meaning—that you might get a better idea of
   what your dream might mean.

Latent Content of Dreams

   The latent content of a dream, Lyon notes, is much more personal and
   emotional. This involves the subconscious meaning of the dream, or what
   dream interpreters would say is the hidden meaning behind your dream.
   In the previous example of arguing with a partner, Lyon explains, it
   might mean that the person is struggling with feeling unworthy of their
   partner’s love.

   Dreaming about a friend you haven't seen in years might symbolically
   represent a subconscious yearning for reconnection or a desire to find
   closure for unresolved feelings. Or it might indicate a broader desire
   for more social connection and companionship in general.

Examples of Dream Symbolism

   "If you ever see someone show up in your dreams, ask yourself: 'What
   does this person symbolize to me?'" Lyon suggests. If it's your:
     * Boss: It might represent struggles with authority.
     * Mother: You might be dealing with struggles related to femininity
       and self-nurturance.
     * High-school teacher: You might be coping with feeling judged or
       graded.

If You Dream About Romance and Relationships

   What does it mean if you dream about your crush or about dating
   someone? Dreaming about a crush might be about the obvious meaning—you
   are interested in being with them romantically. However, Lyon notes,
   that isn't necessarily the whole story.

   Because dreams have manifest (or literal) content and latent (or more
   symbolic) meanings, it is essential to consider both. The manifest
   content of your dreams might reveal deeper, subconscious meanings that
   are worth exploring, particularly if you have a romantic dream about
   someone who isn’t necessarily a potential romantic partner (such as one
   of a friend or boss).

   "Romantic involvement is all about connection," Lyon explains. "So, if
   you are on a date, or even having sex with someone you would not
   expect, that person symbolizes an area of your life that you need to
   connect with more deeply."

Meaning Behind Romantic Dreams About Someone

   According to Lyon, these dreams might be more about:
     * Control over your own life: "If you dream about having sex with
       your boss, you may not actually want to have sex with them, but you
       definitely need to consider how you connect with your own authority
       and assertiveness over your life's direction."
     * Letting go of emotional baggage: "If you dream about having sex
       with your ex, you may not actually want to get back with them, but
       you should definitely consider what unresolved baggage from your
       past that you need to connect with and let go."
     * Personal growth: "If you dream about having sex with your friend,
       think about what are the most important characteristics of your
       friend. Chances are your mind is trying to teach you how to grow as
       a person and connect with those admirable personality traits."

   3 Dream Interpretation Tips, From a Psychotherapist

What Dreaming About Someone Can Tell Us

   Dreams can provide insights into our subconscious thoughts, feelings,
   desires, and fears. They can also offer a perspective that can help
   deepen your relationships in ways that support connection and mental
   well-being.

   Lyon notes it is important to remember that all the roles we play in
   life act as characters that live inside our minds. The characters we
   play (such as parent, partner, friend, or colleague) make up the
   complete picture of who we are as individuals.

   Whenever we are visited by someone in our dreams, we need to consider
   the literal meaning, but then go deeper to think about how that person
   in our dreams is teaching us to connect with a new character that lives
   inside us.
   — JESSE LYON, LMHC, LYON COUNSELING

   "By learning to understand and accept all of the different characters
   that live inside of us, we become more complete as a person and can
   then love others with greater empathy and understanding," Lyon says.

Dream Interpretation Is Not One-Size-Fits-All

   It is important to remember that dream interpretation is highly
   personal. The specific meaning of someone appearing in a dream depends
   on factors that are unique to you. Examining your dreams and trying to
   understand their meanings, both literal and symbolic, can give you
   greater insights into your own thoughts, emotions, and relationships.

   "That's the power of dreams!" Lyon says. "To help us grow and
   understand ourselves in ways that we could never do while awake and,
   from these insights, find peace within ourselves and carry that peace
   to others."

Frequently Asked Questions

     * Does dreaming of someone mean they are thinking of you?
       No. Dreaming about someone is a reflection of your own thoughts and
       subconscious feelings versus an indication of how they are feeling
       or thinking about you. That's why it is important not to make
       inferences about what others might think based on your dreams.
     * Can two people have the same dream?
       While two people can certainly dream about the same topic or have
       similar dreams, their dreams would still differ in various ways.
       Similarities in dreams are most likely due to factors such as
       shared experiences, connections, and cultural influences. For
       example, two friends who attended the same event might have dreams
       with similar elements.
       Common dream themes do exist that often show up in many people's
       dreams. Some things that people commonly dream about include being
       late, falling, flying, school-related activities, sex, and being
       chased.
