   Zane Alsaroori, who grew up on a council estate and lost his brother to
   knife crime, is now a film and television intern

   A film and television intern who grew up on a council estate and lost
   his brother to knife crime has said he wants to inspire people from
   similar backgrounds to "fight for their dreams".

   Zane Alsaroori, 22, grew up on the Wensley estate in Page Hall,
   Sheffield, and started working with Yorkshire-based film production
   company Warp Films earlier this year.

   The company, which made hit TV show Adolescence and thriller series
   Reunion, has launched a new paid internship scheme for people from
   South Yorkshire, which the firm said would "break down barriers" to
   getting into the industry.

   Mr Alsaroori said: "Coming from nothing sometimes gives you the biggest
   push to get everything you want."

   He said his interest in working in the television and film industry
   began when he watched EastEnders with his mother as a child, but he
   added that most of his teachers had "laughed at the idea".

   "A big cloud is over people like me from a council estate and that
   forces other people not to believe in you," he said.

   "It's nobody's fault, people who doubted me in the past had similar
   dreams deep inside, and sometimes they're saying it out of love and
   concern for your future."

   Zane's brother, Sami Alsaroori, was killed in a knife attack in 2017

   Zane was 14 when his brother, Sami Alsaroori, was killed in a knife
   attack aged 31 in 2017.

   "Before he passed, he saw my show reel and was excited to see my
   future, and I didn't want to let that dream die - it kept pushing me,"
   Mr Alsaroori said.

   "I asked if my brother can go so young, why am I living my life for
   others and thinking I can't make it? If I want to make it, I'll make
   it."

   He said he now wanted to encourage other people from similar
   backgrounds not to give up if they dreamed of working in creative
   industries.

   "In my community, people sometimes don't have that faith in themselves
   - but we're not stuck," he said.

   "People going down the wrong paths, a lot of the time, it's from the
   people around you giving you no escape.

   "All this crime takes place because you've got all these lost dreams
   and these creative minds dying, not able to see the light."

   Warp Films has launched the new internship in association with Screen
   Yorkshire and supported by Netflix.

   Niall Shamma, CEO of Warp Films, said: "Growing up in Sheffield and
   going to a comprehensive school, I wasn't aware of the opportunities
   that existed in the film and TV industry, and the position I hold today
   is very much down to a chance meeting along the way.

   "We want to change that and give local people the belief that this
   industry is open to them, and also provide them with a meaningful
   opportunity in the sector."

   Applications open in December exclusively to people living in South
   Yorkshire.

   Mr Alsaroori added there were more opportunities to get into the
   industry than people may realise.

   "There's so much support now, it may have been a different world a few
   years ago, but it's developing faster and faster," he said.

   "You won't be able to see that if you let the negativity eat you up,
   but if you use it as your motivator, you'll see that there is a chance
   and it's so much closer than you think.

   "You don't have to go to London, it can happen right here."

'I turned charity shopping into my dream career'

   Jen Graham posts under the name Charity Shop Girl on social media

   Five years ago, Jen Graham was encouraged by her teenage daughter to
   share her favourite charity shop finds on social media.

   Pregnant with her younger daughter, the self-described second-hand
   fashion addict had just been made redundant from her job at a car
   dealership.

   Fast forward to the present day and Jen has nearly 200,000 followers
   across Instagram and TikTok and is currently filming for the BBC's new
   series Shift the Thrift.

   "Having something that was a hobby and being able to turn it into a
   career for a positive reason of helping these charities is really
   special," says the mother-of-three, who posts under the name Charity
   Shop Girl.

'Sharing styling tips'

   While Jen says she first fell in love with charity shops and the gems
   hidden within them when she was 17, her love of rummaging actually
   started much earlier.

   "My dad told me that when I was five or six years old he used to take
   me to the scrapyard where they sold clothes, bric-a-brac and bits of
   furniture," says Jen, who grew up in the Anfield area of Liverpool and
   now lives in Sandbach, Cheshire.

   "I used to love going there and I would buy the most random stuff.

   "I loved going there more than I loved going to a toy shop!"

   Encouraged by her elder daughter, Jen started sharing styling tips on
   social media.

   It was a move born out of necessity as well as passion, though, after
   she lost her job.

   "I was doing like one item three ways, and how I would wear this item
   and where I got it from and how much it was," she says.

   As her following began to grow, she started sharing the gems she had
   discovered while sifting through the rails at charity shops.

   "It just took off from there," says Jen.

   Her top discoveries include a YSL blazer for just £20, a Coach jacket
   for £30 and a Hermes purse for £25 as well as clothes from her
   favourite brands such as Jaeger and Frank Usher.

   Jen says it is important to shop out of season while charity shopping

   With her growing following came media opportunities including a styling
   segment on ITV's This Morning as well as becoming an ambassador for the
   The Air Ambulance Service and the National Children's Air Ambulance.

   But what top tips would she give to someone on the hunt for
   budget-friendly, sustainable fashion choices?

   "You've got to be prepared to go in for a rummage," she says.

   "You find one-off unique items - it's cheaper and the money is going
   back into the charity.

   "That's my main reason for charity shopping."

   Scotland v Greece Highlights
   By
   Tom English
   BBC Scotland's chief sports writer in Stadio Georgios Karaiskaki
     * Published
       15 November 2025

   Minutes after the final whistle sounded in Piraeus, a roar went up from
   the Tartan Army packed into a corner of Stadio Georgios Karaiskakis.
   Undiluted euphoria. Proper jubilation.

   The celebration of Ben Gannon-Doak scoring to make it 3-1 and Ryan
   Christie scoring to make it 3-2 were loud and lusty, but this was
   somehow different. Joy laced with relief and disbelief.

   A gift from Copenhagen. Full-time, Denmark 2 Belarus 2. Scotland died a
   thrilling death in Greece but Belarus' impossible draw resuscitated
   Scottish hopes of automatic qualification for the World Cup.

   A win against Denmark at Hampden on Tuesday night and it's done. An
   opportunity that looked like it had been trampled underfoot when the
   dismal visitors in Piraeus fell three goals down, was reborn thanks to
   Belarus, the unlikeliest of unlikely heroes of the night.

   In the birthplace of Western drama, a classic night unfolded from
   around the hour-mark, in Greece and in Copenhagen, a tragicomedy and a
   mystery and a farce.

   This wasn't the ancient amphitheatre of Herodium down the road, but it
   was a sporting spectacle all the same, twisting and turning,
   bewildering and perplexing.

   While Scotland were starting to find themselves in Piraeus there was a
   hell of a production going on in Copenhagen. For the last half an hour
   we existed in two places at once, body in Greece, mind, or part of, in
   Denmark.
     * Scotland down but not out after Greece defeat
     * Belarus stun Denmark with draw to keep Scotland in hunt
     * Sportsound: Greek defeat but Scots' march to World Cup continues

   Before it all started to get trippy, Scotland were losing 3-0 and
   Denmark were winning 1-0, a series of results that made Scottish hopes
   of automatic qualification a dead duck. Hampden would not have its
   howitzer showdown. The play-offs beckoned. Oh well. Luck had run out.
   It was bound to in the end. And then. And then.

   What madness was this coming down the line from the Parken Stadium in
   Copenhagen. Belarus, with a world ranking of 103, had scored a 62nd
   minute equaliser against Denmark with a world ranking of 20. Denmark,
   the top of the table thrusters, being held by Belarus, the bottom of
   the table whipping boys?

   And now, three minutes later, a goal for Ben Gannon-Doak to make it
   3-1, a just reward for all of Scotland's pressure towards the end of
   the first half that saw Scott McTominay's shot from distance come
   slapping back off Greece's crossbar, that also saw Che Adams miss from
   close-range just before Gannon-Doak did likewise.

   Noise and hope for the visiting fans. A draw in Denmark meant that
   Scotland could still qualify automatically with a win against the Danes
   at Hampden on Tuesday. Direct entry to the World Cup was back on.
   Cancel the sob stories. A dream was alive despite Greece lording it.

   But hold up, what lunacy is this? Within seconds of Gannon-Doak's goal,
   Denmark 1 Belarus 2. And five minutes after that, Greece 3 Scotland 2,
   Ryan Christie heading home. Goals flying around like snuff at a wake.
   The Tartan Army in delirium. Scotland driving at Greece's heart in a
   bid to sicken them again after sickening them at Hampden earlier in the
   group.

   In that moment the Greeks might have looked at Scotland as something
   from a Hollywood B movie, an evil creature in a lagoon, riddled with
   bullets, stake through the heart, as dead as dead can be only for a
   hand to come shooting out of the water to signify life and menace.

   McTominay came within a Odysseas Vlachodimos wonder save from making it
   3-3. Then, a red card from Tasos Bakasetas, the Greece captain. Then,
   more Scotland pressure. Then, a Denmark leveller. Then, a wait.

   Some of the Scotland players hung about on the pitch to hear the final
   score from Copenhagen, A Denmark winner was the doomsday, the mood
   killer for Tuesday night when the sides come together.

   Seconds went by and then confirmation. A draw, "Winner takes all at
   Hampden," gushed Andy Robertson. Rarely in football has one man sounded
   so happy after losing a game of football that everyone thought they
   could not afford to lose.

   A gigantic favour from Belarus? In the millions of words said and
   written in the preamble to this game, in all the different scenarios
   presented about how it might all pan out, nobody came up with this.
   Nobody saw this twist in the tale. A clairvoyant wouldn't have called
   it. Mystic Meg on her best day wouldn't have predicted it.

Lady Luck leaves the building... then returns

   Beforehand, we wondered if the luck that Scotland enjoyed in their two
   previous games in the group would hold and for the longest time it
   looked like Lady Luck had left the building, storming out in an
   almighty strop.

   Greece were outrageously dominant and led 1-0. Only Craig Gordon's
   excellence kept the score down, but time looked to be running out for
   Scotland. One became two and two became three - and it was a shambles.
   Defensively, Scotland were shocking. Grant Hanley and John Souttar
   looked like nervous kittens, spooked by the vision and accuracy and
   brilliance of Christos Tzolis and the coruscating teenager Konstantinos
   Karetsas.

   Scotland conceded six shots on target in the opening 45 minutes, their
   highest total in a first half in more than nine years. They ceded space
   and time to Greece, who had it easy. Ahead of Tuesday night, Scotland's
   limp beginning isn't so much food for thought for Clarke, it's a
   veritable feast, a banquet of things to fix, in tactics, in formation,
   in selection, in psychology.

   Belarus broke Scotland out of jail. Just when you thought they had
   drained the well of good fortune they got the biggest and most
   unpredictable dollop of luck imaginable.

   And so to Clarke talking later. He was asked if he'd ever known a night
   like this one in football. "Plenty of them," he said. We wouldn't mind
   interrogating him further on that one. Name them...

   'We got a lucky break, Belarus have done us a big favour' - Clarke

   He called it a strange game and posited the theory that the 2-1 win
   against Belarus last month, when Scotland were booed off, was a better
   three points than people imagined. Freakishly, he might be right on
   that.

   He didn't hide from the fact that Scotland were blessed by the miracle
   of Belarus. How could he? But he also said something that has a deep
   relevance to the endgame in this group. "We have to believe in
   ourselves more," he pointed out, before elaborating on Scotland's
   dominance late on, the chances they created, the power and aggression
   they showed, the quality they put on the pitch that was invisible for
   too long.

   "For the last 15-20 minutes we put a very good side on the back foot,
   we put them to the sword," he said.

   It's all of those minutes that went before that were the problem. How
   can a team that finished so strongly look so passive and so vulnerable
   at the start? He doesn't have long to find the answers, but Scotland's
   World Cup aspirations now depend on him figuring it out.

   Salomão," a 1977 Brazilian comedy that remains one of the country's
   biggest box office hits.

   "When I saw that giant screen, wow, I was mesmerized. I thought:
   someday I'll have a movie theater of my own," he said. "Fifty years
   later, that dream has come true."

   In 2022, Costa opened Cine LT3, a 35-seat cinema in Sao Paulo. Using
   his savings and credit card, he spent about 100,000 reais ($18,600) to
   renovate an old garage, buy vintage wooden seats -- which he found in
   an old shuttered theater in the countryside -- and transform the space
   into a movie theater.

   The screening room now occupies what was once a studio -- a space
   behind the garage of his small company that was left idle during the
   pandemic. Costa, who worked as a TV producer, opened the studios in
   2012 and rents them out for screening tests and commercials. Where cars
   once stood, there are now tables and chairs where moviegoers can wait
   for their sessions, along with a small counter where he sells popcorn,
   snacks, soft drinks and wine.

   There's also a small box office where Costa sells tickets to walk-ins.
   To buy in advance, customers must send him a WhatsApp message to
   reserve directly.

   "The movie theater is just me. I project the films, make the popcorn,
   sell the tickets, everything. For economic reasons, I can't afford an
   employee," Costa said. "But I also think that's part of the charm. I
   know the regulars by name, and that's what makes this place different."

A tale of resistance

   Cine LT3 has established itself as a small haven for film lovers,
   slowly building a loyal neighborhood community and drawing movie buffs
   with programming that stands apart from the city's multiplexes.

   Costa's independent cinema is also part of a resistance of venues
   surviving outside the mall circuit. According to 2024 official data,
   there were only 423 screening rooms in small theaters like LT3 across
   the country. In contrast, nearly 90% of Brazil's 3,542 cinema screens
   operate inside shopping malls.

   Some of the country's most traditional stand-alone cinemas now rely on
   corporate sponsorships to stay open. Many others have shut down and
   been demolished. In Sao Paulo, where the buildings remain, the former
   screening rooms have often been repurposed into evangelical churches or
   adult movie theaters.

   Even the venues that survived have faced the threat of closure in
   recent years. When that happens, local movie lovers often organize
   protests -- and in some cases, they succeed. That was the case with
   Cine Belas Artes, located on one of the city's most iconic corners, at
   the intersection of Avenida Paulista.

   Maria Amélia Marcos, a 71-year-old teacher, was visiting LT3 for the
   first time on Thursday, though she often goes to other independent
   theaters around Sao Paulo. She believes these venues are essential to
   preserving the city's cultural memory.

   "Independent theaters are very important because they have a completely
   different appeal," she said. The film selection is fantastic. I imagine
   the curators are very thoughtful people who want audiences to see the
   kind of movies they themselves would love to watch."

A man's life dream

   Costa curates the lineup himself, focusing on art-house titles from
   Brazil and abroad. When The Associated Press visited the theater on
   Thursday, the schedule included a restored screening of "Paris, Texas,"
   part of a citywide retrospective marking the 80th birthday of German
   director Wim Wenders.

   Maída Alves, 63, a regular at LT3, had just left a screening of "Paris,
   Texas" when she spoke with the AP. For her, the venue holds deep
   emotional value. Having witnessed collective spaces emptying out during
   the pandemic, she sees the theater as a rare and essential common
   ground.

   "I think Costa does a really great job," she said. "I see him selling
   tickets, making popcorn, cleaning, running the film, answering the
   phone. That fascinates me. It shows how you have to take initiative to
   pursue a dream, which I imagine is his life's dream."

   Costa often hears people question his decisions, especially from a
   financial perspective. While he admits the work is challenging, he is
   happy doing what he loves. And he loves cinema, just like Toto, the
   protagonist of his favorite movie, "Cinema Paradiso," whom he paid
   tribute to with a painting on the wall outside LT3.

   The character bonds with a local cinema projectionist and, through that
   relationship, develops a lifelong devotion to movies. Costa said he
   sees his own life in Toto's story and believes movies have the power to
   transform people.

   "No one leaves a movie theater the same way they entered," he said.
   Watching people come and go from his theater every day for the past
   three years, he says he has learned more about human nature.

   "For example, I screen a film, and some people leave crying while
   others don't understand it at all. I can see the diversity of human
   beings," he said. "What affects one person emotionally doesn't have the
   same effect on another. I learn something new every day."

   NEW YORK (AP) -- When she was still just a child, Meg Donnelly gave off
   a serious theater kid vibe. At 5, her favorite musical role wasn't the
   sunny "Annie." It was Mimi from "Rent," the struggling erotic dancer
   who is also a heroin addict.

   Donnelly grew up to become a film and TV star through her breakout role
   in Disney's music-filled "Zombies" franchise and the ABC sitcom
   "American Housewife." She's also appeared on "The Masked Singer" and
   has a new EP, "dying art."

   This week, the New Jersey-raised actor returned to her first love --
   theater. Donnelly made her Broadway debut Tuesday in "Moulin Rouge! The
   Musical," playing cabaret star Santine. She'll be aboard the jukebox
   hit until March.

   The show is about the goings-on in a turn-of-the-century Parisian
   nightclub, updated with tunes like "Single Ladies" and "Firework"
   alongside the big hit "Lady Marmalade."

   The Associated Press got a chance to ask Donnelly about her big night
   and how it fits into her blossoming career. Answers have been edited
   for clarity and brevity.

AP: What was your debut like?

   DONNELLY: It was really surreal. I feel like I've been working towards
   this since I was a little girl. When I was younger, Broadway was the
   only option. I was a full theater kid -- that's all I wanted to do.
   And, you know, life just took me in different directions. But this is
   something that I feel I was born to do and just being on stage last
   night, it kind of all just makes sense.

AP: You're in the Al Hirschfeld Theatre. Do you think you ever saw a show
there before?

   DONNELLY: I definitely do. I saw "Kinky Boots" twice. I love "Kinky
   Boots." And I think I saw "Kiss Me Kate" there, too.

AP: What's your favorite musical?

   DONNELLY: My favorite musical of all time is "Rent." I saw it a lot
   when I was younger -- maybe when I was too young -- and my dream role
   has always been Mimi, which is really funny. So when I was like 5 or 6
   auditioning for theater, they would be like, "What's your dream role?"
   And everyone would be, like, "Annie" or "Matilda" and I'd be like,
   "Mimi!" They'd be like, "Oh my God, this kid!" So, it is very full
   circle because "Moulin Rouge" is based on the same opera as "Rent."
   Satine is kind of Mimi.

AP: So much of your career makes this a natural step. You played a young
woman who sang in a school production of "Little Shop of Horrors" on
"American Housewife" and everything about the "Zombie" franchise screams
musical theater. How do you describe your path here?

   DONNELLY: There's not a right or wrong path. You know, there's so many
   things in my career where I'm like, "Oh, I wish I'd done that" or
   "Maybe I should have gone that way." I'm a very chronic over-thinker.
   But it really doesn't matter. I will say, being a part of Disney
   definitely changed my life.

AP: Another Broadway-adjacent step was when you were in the cast of NBC's
live telecast of "The Sound of Music" in 2013. You were the understudy for
Louisa von Trapp, right?

   DONNELLY: Yes, I understudied Louisa and Ella Watts-Gorman, who played
   Louisa, was so talented and amazing. I was praying that nothing
   happened to her. We weren't really taught much. We knew the music, but
   that was pretty much it, so I was like, "Dear God, please, let
   everything go OK."

AP: Audra McDonald starred in that, right?

   DONNELLY: Oh my god. Listening to her sing on set was one of the best
   gifts I've ever been given.

AP: What about your own music?

   DONNELLY: That is something that I really want to pursue. I feel like
   writing my own music is just so therapeutic for me, and I love
   performing on stage. Having to do a new show every single night and
   making everything different and feeding off the energy of the different
   crowd -- that's what I want to do with my own music as well.

AP: You did theater growing up alongside Helen J. Shen, who created her part
in "Maybe Happy Ending," right? Would you also like to originate a role one
day?

   DONNELLY: That was such a cool thing to watch her go through and it's
   so personal, something that she built with them. That would be really,
   really cool. Just to have that connection to it as well. So, yeah,
   originating would be really like that would great.

   The author with his family on their farm in Shenandoah County,
   Virginia. (Photo provided by the author)

   I live in Shenandoah County, Virginia. I'm a factory worker. A farmer.
   A father of two
   girls, one still in diapers. I get up before the sun, and most days I
   don't sit down until
   after it's gone.

   My partner Hannah and I raise our girls on a small farm in the Valley.
   She works
   full-time too-though nobody calls it that. She's a caregiver, a
   homemaker, a livestock
   handler, and a mother. She doesn't get a paycheck. She doesn't get a
   break. She
   doesn't get counted.

   We've relied on a cistern for water for over three years. I'm trying to
   save up to dig a
   well before it runs dry. We heat with firewood I cut myself. We raise
   animals for milk,
   eggs, and meat because the grocery bill outpaces my paycheck.

   We've stayed unmarried--not because we don't love each other, but
   because getting
   married would kick my partner and our daughters off the Medicaid that
   keeps them
   healthy.

   My employer offers insurance, sure--but only if I pay nearly as much as
   our mortgage. I
   can't, so we stay as we are; in love but locked out.

   I'm not ashamed of our life. It's honest work, and it's full of love.
   However, I am ashamed that in a country as wealthy as ours, people like
   us are left out in the cold.

   When the so-called "Big Beautiful Bill" passed, it was marketed as a
   win for working
   Americans. From where I stand, it looks like the opposite. Cuts to
   Medicaid, reduced
   support for struggling families, and a ballooning deficit that somehow
   still leaves us
   more exposed than before.

   You can dress it up however you want, but if it leaves working families
   behind, it's not
   serving the people.

   This bill, like so many before it, rewards the already powerful while
   punishing the
   people who hold up the economy in invisible ways. It gives to those who
   lobby and
   takes from those who labor. It reinforces a message I've felt in my
   bones for years:
   You're on your own.

   I'm not writing this as a Democrat or a Republican. I'm writing this as
   a man watching
   families like mine wear themselves thin; working hard, doing the right
   things, and still
   falling behind.

   This isn't about Red or Blue. It's about the fact that we're being
   divided against each
   other while both sides forget that real Americans bleed the same when
   the cost of
   insulin triples or the cost of groceries goes up again.

   You shouldn't be able to carry a hundred dollars' worth of groceries in
   two hands. But
   these days, you can-and that's not just wrong, it's dangerous.

   I'm writing to ask one simple thing: Who is this country really for?

   Because if it's not for parents doing their best to raise good kids in
   a broken system...
   If it's not for factory workers and farmers who show up every day, no
   matter how little
   is left in the tank...
   If it's not for families trying to make a life from the land and a
   paycheck...
   Then maybe the flag doesn't wave for all of us after all.

   I don't want handouts. I want fairness. I don't want politics. I want
   policy that works.

   I don't want a revolution of violence. I want a revolution of
   responsibility-one where we
   take care of each other, where people can raise a family without
   choosing between
   groceries and medicine, and where love doesn't have to take a back seat
   to red tape.

   So, if you're in power, hear me: We are not okay. We are drowning
   quietly.

   And if you're not in power, but you're reading this and nodding along,
   then know this:
   you're not alone either.

   We're not enemies. We're neighbors.We're parents, workers, and
   caretakers. And it's time we start acting like it.

   With respect,
   A father holding faith

       Amen to a man and woman who are courageous, smart, responsible,
       caring and respectful people who understand what our country should
       be. A country that cares for one another and should be representing
       all of its citizens.

       I'm with you, brother! I'm old enough to remember when the
       democrats were for working families and I wish they could find
       their way back to that. In the meantime, thanks for speaking out!

A dream study for father-daughter duo

   ASU professor teams up with his 9-year-old daughter to study lucid
   dreams

   October 02, 2025

   Many parents only dream of sharing their passion with their child. But
   one father recently had an opportunity to make that dream a reality.

   Michael Varnum, a psychology professor at Arizona State University, and
   his 9-year-old daughter, Clara Varnum, co-authored a scientific study
   that links personality traits and other individual differences to the
   frequency of lucid dreams.

   Lucid dreaming is the state of consciously realizing you are dreaming
   while still inside of the dream. The study offers insights into what
   makes some people more likely to have these unusual dream experiences.

   "There's not a whole lot of scientific work out there on lucid dreams,
   nor dreams more generally, compared to other topics that modern
   psychologists tend to study," Varnum said. "Dreams are inherently
   fascinating to most of us, and lucid dreams especially. But we know
   very little about them. Clara and I realized we had some new questions
   we wanted to ask about them."

   The study ran in "Dreaming," a scientific journal published by the
   American Psychological Association.

Eye-opening findings

   Our fascination with dreams goes back to ancient times when
   philosophers such as Plato thought  they represented a challenging
   puzzle about the nature of reality. Neurologist Sigmund Freud
   believed they were windows into our deepest fears and desires.

   In psychological studies of dreams, called oneirology, researchers
   focus on how dreams relate to brain function, especially memory and
   mental health. Unlike dream interpretation, which looks for meaning,
   scientific dream research studies how dreaming works using measurable
   data.

   "We sought to explore the relationship of a wide range of individual
   differences and the propensity to experience lucid dreams," wrote
   Varnum in the study. "We attempted to replicate prior associations with
   openness, nightmare frequency and how often people experience lucid
   dreams."

   The researchers explored the link between lucid dream frequency and
   variables such as the need for cognition, vividness of waking visual
   imagery and scholastic aptitude.

   According to the duo's research, people who had a more open attitude
   along with a cognitive curiosity were more likely to have lucid dreams.

   "Big personality traits, people who are more open to new experiences
   and people who are more outgoing reported having more frequent lucid
   dreams," Varnum said.

   The pair discovered that people who have the ability to create more
   vivid visual imagery in their minds when they are awake "also have more
   lucid dreams as well as more unusual dreams -- dreams where the person
   visits the same fictitious place or has dream friends that don't exist
   in real life, that kind of stuff."

   And they found that it is not always "sweet dreams" for lucid dreamers.

   "This is something that was observed in prior studies as well, that
   people who report more nightmares also have more lucid dreams," Varnum
   said.

   That made sense for Clara, who gave a nod to all of those experiences.

   "People with openness are ... generally more trusting. I find that I'm
   quite trusting and ... honest," said Clara, who attended ASU's Child
   Study Lab in preschool and is currently enrolled at the Knox Gifted
   Academy. "And also, it's rare that I have a dream that I remember not
   being a nightmare. And they're very intense nightmares."

   When it came to scholastic aptitude, they found that people with high
   grades on tests such as the SAT or ACT are actually less likely to
   experience lucid dreams. People who were considered "emotionally
   stable" were also less likely to experience lucid dreams. No gender
   factor was found in the study.

The dream team

   The idea for a lucid dream study sprung from an ordinary conversation
   between Varnum and his daughter while they were driving in the car
   -- and it evolved from there.

   "We talk a lot about ideas," Varnum said. "She has a scientist for a
   parent and that's something I love to do and something she finds
   interesting. We were talking about a dream she'd had -- a lucid dream
   -- and how we, and probably lots of other folks, have dreams where we
   sometimes become aware that we're asleep. And we were speculating a
   little bit about what's behind that and whether some people are more
   likely to have them than others.

   "And then she came to my lab every day with me, and I walked her
   through the whole process, from hypothesis to generation," he said.

   Varnum sees this research as a steppingstone toward more scientific
   studies in this area. Dreams have always intrigued people, but lucid
   dreams have been gaining significant scientific attention in recent
   years.

   "I think it seems to be entering the zeitgeist more," he said. "So it
   seems like -- at least among part of the scientific community -- that
   there is a greater interest as well."

   He hopes his experience will also serve as encouragement or perhaps
   even a wake-up call for other scientists with children.

   "I hope this inspires other scientists to take their kids a little more
   seriously in their curiosity," he said. "And just because you're 9
   years old doesn't mean you can't co-author a scientific paper. It
   doesn't mean you can't be part of pretty much every step of the
   process.

   "This is how we train future scientists, right? And even if we're not
   training future scientists, we're helping people to actually understand
   the process."

   Varnum was the lead for data curation on the study, responsible for
   formal analysis, investigation, methodology, project administration,
   writing, reviewing and editing. Clara served in a supporting role for
   investigation, methodology, writing, reviewing and editing.

   This is the fifth grader's first academic publication, and she said
   that coauthoring the study helped her learn more about lucid dreams as
   they relate to her personal experience.

   "I never really thought about them as a thing that some people just
   don't really have," she said.

   And though Clara says she aspires to become a fashion designer when she
   grows up, she also enjoyed the scientific process.

   "I'd really like to do this sort of thing in science again," she said,
   "because I love science, and honestly, when you have a dad who's a
   scientist, it's kind of hard not to."

The price of the American Dream has surpassed $5M -- nearly 50% costlier than
two years ago

   By
   Georgia Worrell
   Published Sep. 13, 2025, 11:24 a.m. ET

   Welcome to the land of the fee and home of the bills.

   The price of the American Dream surpassed $5 million in 2025 - a
   staggering $600,000 more than in 2024 and nearly 50% higher than just
   two years ago, according to a new Investopedia study.

   The eye-watering $5,043,323 sum is the estimated total lifetime cost
   for typical American goals and milestones, including a wedding,
   healthcare, retirement, raising two kids and paying for their college,
   new cars every five years, and owning a home.

   The eye-watering $5,043,323 sum includes the amount needed to raise two
   kids for 18 years and put them both through four-year universities --
   $876,092 -- and the cost of owning a home, which rose to $929,955 this
   year. Studio Romantic - stock.adobe.com

   The dream cost $4.4 million last year and just $3.4 million in 2023,
   the investment site found.

   "What most Americans deem to be reasonable financial milestones in
   their lives are becoming increasingly expensive, outpacing inflation,
   and are seemingly out of reach for many," report author and
   Investopedia's chief editor Caleb Silver told The Post.

   The price surge this year, in part, was due to Investopedia factoring
   in the estimated lifetime cost for healthcare -- $414,208 -- which
   wasn't included in previous breakdowns, Silver explained.

   Meanwhile, the price of retirement jumped to $1,636,881 - a nearly
   $40,000 increase from last year - and the amount needed to raise two
   kids for 18 years and put them both through four-year universities
   climbed roughly the same amount, to $876,092 this year compared to
   $832,172 in 2024.

   In 2025, the average American is expected to shell out $38,200 on a
   wedding; $39,381 on taking care of two pets, a cat and a dog; and
   $180,621 on annual vacations over a lifetime, Investopedia found.

   These figures saw small changes compared to last year.

   In contrast, a family buying 10 new cars over 50 years will now fork
   over $900,346 - nearly $90,000 more than last year's $811,440 estimate
   - thanks to pricier insurance and higher financing costs.

   Up from last year's $929,955 estimate, the cost of purchasing and
   financing a house now stands at $957,594, as "a steady rise in home
   prices alongside high mortgage rates has made the dream of
   homeownership costlier than ever," the report stated.

   While "the reality is that most of us won't earn anywhere close to $5
   million over the course of our adult working careers," Silver said,
   "it's important to note that everyone's dream is different and has its
   own unique price tag."

   And despite the hefty price tag, a survey from earlier this year found
   that hope in the American Dream was alive and well, with nearly seven
   in 10 U.S. adults saying they either believe they'll achieve its key
   milestones or already have.

   More Americans said their family is already living the dream or they
   felt it was within their reach this year compared to last year,
   according to the 2025 American Dream Snapshot.

IAN WALLACE

DREAM PSYCHOLOGIST

A DREAM IS JUST A DREAM UNTIL YOU PUT IT INTO ACTION

   The word dream has two meanings in our language. Dreams can mean the
   nightly phenomena that we all create and can also be our greatest life
   ambitions. Although these two meanings seem quite different, they are
   fundamentally connected by a deeper level of self-awareness. By
   exploring your dreams and becoming more aware of what they mean, you
   naturally connect with practical ways to consistently fulfil your
   deepest aspirations.

About Ian Wallace

   ABOUT IAN WALLACE

   Ian Wallace is a best-selling author and popular broadcaster on the
   subject of dreams and psychology. Ian is widely acclaimed in the media
   for his live dream analysis, performed with an expert empathy and
   immediacy that entertains, informs and educates. He regularly appears
   on television, on radio and in print, where is consistently recognised
   and applauded for his articulacy, his accuracy and his authority. Ian
   is the originator of the Dream Connection Process, a uniquely powerful
   method that enables anyone to connect the imagery and symbolism that
   they create in their dreams to opportunities in waking life where they
   can use this insight to make a healthy difference.

About Dreams

   ABOUT DREAMS

   Your dreams reflect the fundamental patterns of your waking life and,
   although your nightly dreams and your daily life may seem to have no
   connection, the word `dream' also means your waking hopes and
   aspirations, as well as your night-time adventures. Even though the
   intentional pursuit of your waking dreams and the natural creation of
   your nocturnal dreams may seem to be entirely separate, they are both
   primarily driven by a deeper level of self-awareness that we all
   possess. This more elemental understanding of yourself is a natural
   human quality and is known as your unconscious awareness.

About Psychology

   ABOUT PSYCHOLOGY

   When exploring dreams, it can be all too easy to become fixated on the
   dream and find yourself ignoring the dreamer who is creating all the
   dreams. To really understand the meanings and messages from the dreams,
   it is incredibly helpful to have an understanding of the dreamer and
   their potential behaviour patterns. Psychology is the study of human
   behaviour and goes beyond the purely conscious and physical
   manifestations of what it means to be human. Although psychological
   studies can be complex explorations with many apparent contradictions,
   the basics of psychology are who you are, what you need and what you
   believe.

DREAMS DON'T HAPPEN TO YOU, YOU HAPPEN TO YOUR DREAMS

   DREAMS DON'T HAPPEN TO YOU, YOU HAPPEN TO YOUR DREAMS

   Dreams don't just happen to you, you actually happen to your dreams.
   You create everything in your dreams. Every person you encounter, every
   place you go, every event you experience is generated by your
   unconscious self. By understanding why you create your unique dream
   content, you invariably achieve a profound understanding of who you
   really are, what you really need, and what you really believe.

   This is also true for your dreams in waking life. Your greatest
   ambitions and deepest aspirations don't just happen to you - you have
   to actively create them. By using the unconscious understanding you
   create every night in your dreams, you can connect far more deeply and
   successfully with your lifetime ambitions and aspirations.

FAST COMPANY, WORK DREAMS

   Fast Company Magazine, Work Dreams

   As we sleep, our unconscious mind often reflects on the things which we
   are unable to or unwilling to face during the day. And since we spend a
   big chunk of our waking lives at work--and given that we are often
   unable to express our true emotions in professional settings--it should
   come as no surprise that work-related dreams are incredibly common.

   "Part of the excitement of lucid dreaming is the realisation that you

   says Ian Wallace, a psychologist, dream expert, and author of The
   Complete A to Z Dictionary of Dreams. "By using lucid dreams to work
   through challenging situations in your waking life, you naturally begin
   to realise you also have the power to create the day-to-day reality you

   Decoding our work dreams

   Most of our accumulated emotional tension is generated from
   encountering conflicts and challenges at work, particularly with
   colleagues. So, it's natural that our jobs count for a lot of our dream
   activity. However, the work environments and colleagues we create in
   our dreams are not those actual places and people, but rather symbols
   of personal realisation and development.

   What your dreams are trying to tell you and what to do about them

   The prominent dream psychologist says staying within the dream, facing
   your fear and taking control of events can be beneficial to your
   well-being. He believes the images conjured in the mind during slumber
   are linked to someone's abilities and needs in the real world; you just
   need to look closely and read into the symbols encoded within.
   According to Wallace's technique, dreams are a powerful reflective tool
   that can act as a compass pointing towards needs the dreamer didn't
   even know they had.

A Psychologist's Dream Interpretation Of Common Dreams

   A Psychologist's Dream Interpretation Of Common Dreams

   We all have dreams every night. Yes, although sometimes it seems like
   you don't have one. But the reality is you have. Some dreams are
   forgotten when you wake up and some are clear. Well, there is another
   explanation for that which is not the subject of this post. While
   dreams are a common phenomenon to all people across cultures, it is
   also one of the most mysterious human experiences. It produces more
   questions than answers. For instance, you might ask why do we dream?
   Or, what do dreams mean?

What your dreams really mean

   What your dreams really mean

   Whether you're flying, your teeth are falling out or you're trying (but
   failing) to run away from a predator, most of us have dedicated plenty
   of time to trying to make sense of our dreams. Is our subconscious
   trying to tell us something? Is it our brains filing information away?
   Or is it a metaphor for something big happening in our lives? Ian
   Wallace, a globally prominent psychologist, told Coach dreams are
   actually a combination of all three - and it's certainly not about
   mysticism or being psychic. "A dream is how you imagine yourself," he
   explains. "It's how you imagine the person you have been and how you
   imagine the person you would like to become."

DREAMS AND DELIRIUM, INTENSIVE CARE SOCIETY TALK

   Dreams and Delirium are two states of consciousness that often don't

   communication. In this presentation I gave at the `Delirium In The ICU'

   Cognitive Framing methods can be helpful in making sense of apparently

WORKING WITH CHILDRENS DREAMS

   When working with children's dreams, it's clear to see that dreaming is
   a wonderful thing for a child to do. One of the fantastic things about
   dreams is the realization that the dream doesn't happen to you, you
   actually happen to the dream and you create everything you experience
   in it. So what you do in your dream is you are creating a far better
   understanding of who you are, what you need, what you believe - it's
   fantastic snapshot of who you are.  A dream is the ultimate selfie.

   hilarious, just a man lying in bed, unconsciously muttering to himself.
   If Matt was fully awake when expressing himself in this way, it would
   be termed a word salad, an attempt to communicate an idea that just
   emerges in a confused jumble of seemingly random words and phonemes.

BBC IWONDER, LUCID DREAMING

   Do I have the power to control my dreams? How do I recognize a lucid
   dream? We all have the power to dream. But the first step to
   experiencing a lucid dream is recognising that you are in fact
   dreaming. It's not as easy as it sounds and not quite as simple as
   employing the traditional pinch. It may sound a little unusual, but
   just like when we are exploring any intriguing situation, we do this by
   looking out for clues. We can identify these clues that we can create
   in our dreams by being on the look-out for anything that appears
   strange or out of context. And to help us, we can use a powerful
   connection process to recognise them and work with them. We'll start
   with actually identifying the clue.

   Analysing Welsh listeners' dreams from further north on the Celtic
   fringe in BBC Pacific Quay, Glasgow. Dreams analysed include Beryl's
   blood, skeletons and telephone box dream, and Scott's power-sliding
   into a forest dream and then trying to take off in an aeroplane.
   Beryl's dream suggests that she might need to speak up more and express
   her needs in waking life, rather than always looking after the needs of
   other people.

The science of dreams: what happens in the brain when we dream

   Muse Team
   November 03, 2020

   ||Dreaming|||||||||||||||dreams, meditation, sleep|dreams, meditation,
   sleep|dreams, meditation, sleep||||

TL;DR:

   What happens when we dream may still feel mysterious, but research is
   beginning to uncover what's happening in the brain. During REM sleep,
   brain activity increases--especially in the regions that regulate
   memory and emotion. While the science behind dreams is still unfolding,
   experts believe dreaming helps us process emotions, store key memories,
   and prepare for challenges we face when awake.

   dreams, meditation, sleep

   Let's be real - dreams are dreamy. There's so much we don't know about
   them, and yet they can reveal so much. From flying through clouds to
   seeing people from your past, our dreams are full of mystery and
   meaning.

   For centuries, humans believed dreams were messages from the gods or
   windows into the subconscious(1).Today, science is beginning to unpack
   what really happens in the brain while we sleep--and why dreams might
   serve a deeper purpose than we once thought.

   In this article, we'll explore the science behind dreaming: how dreams
   are formed in the brain, what REM sleep really does, and why you often
   can't remember a single thing by morning.

How do dreams work?

   Dreaming has fascinated humans for centuries. When you look at ancient
   civilizations, they believed dreams were prophecies or divine messages
   (2), and Freud later proposed they revealed repressed desires (2).
   While the exact purpose of dreaming remains unclear, modern science has
   shifted the conversation from symbolism to brain function, offering new
   insights into what happens when we sleep(3).

REM sleep

   REM sleep, known as the stage where dreams are most vivid--activates
   areas like the amygdala, hippocampus, and visual cortex, while
   deactivating the prefrontal cortex, which explains why dreams often
   feel illogical (3). These neural patterns support theories that dreams
   help process emotions, consolidate memory, and simulate real-life
   scenarios. REM sleep also supports neuroplasticity, as it can
   strengthen and organize neural connections tied to learning and memory.

   To activate REM sleep, one needs to get sufficient sleep, which is 7-9
   hours per night,(4), and studies show that REM periods lengthen and
   intensify in the final sleep cycles (5). REM sleep has been linked to
   emotional regulation, creative insight, and next-day problem-solving
   (6;3).

Alternative function of dreaming

   Some researchers believe dreams serve practical functions beyond
   storytelling. The threat simulation theory suggests dreaming evolved to
   help us mentally rehearse danger in a safe, low-risk setting (15).

   Others argue dreams act as neural housekeeping, clearing out irrelevant
   memories to make space for more useful ones (16). While no single
   theory has been proven, most agree that dreaming reflects coordinated
   brain activity tied to memory, emotion, and adaptation.

What part of the brain controls dreams?

   Dreams aren't driven by a single control center--they emerge from a
   network of brain regions working together. Research shows that the
   default mode network (DMN), a system linked to spontaneous thought and
   imagination, remains active during REM sleep and may help construct the
   narrative flow of dreams (9).

   The parietal lobes, which help the brain understand space and where
   things are, are thought to support the immersive, scene-like quality of
   dreams--like walking through a room or flying over a city (10). The
   temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), where the temporal and parietal lobes
   meet, has been linked to self-awareness during dreaming, and may play a
   key role in lucid dreaming, which is when someone realizes they're
   dreaming while it's happening (11).
   Despite advances in neuroscience, there's still no single, proven
   theory that explains exactly why we dream or how dreams are generated
   in one definite way. Crazy, right?

Dreams & what's happening in the brain

   Dreaming is such a fascinating topic because everyone dreams (even if
   you don't remember them), but the experience of dreaming can vary from
   person to person. We do know that most dreams last about 5-20 minutes,
   and you can have multiple dreams in a night. The variability is in the
   experience of dreaming, recollection, and intensity (12).

   Some people remember their dreams vividly, and others do not. Some have
   the same dream over and over while others rarely repeat a dream. Some
   remember only a handful of dreams in their lifetime but others can
   recall dreams nightly. Some are lucid dreamers, and most of us are not.
   Others dream in color, while some dream in black and white (13).

   dreams, meditation, sleep


Muse's EEG Spectogram image above shows the intensity of brainwave activity
over time. High-intensity regions are indicated by tones of red, yellow,
green, and low-intensity regions are indicated by tones of blue.

   Up until the advent of the electroencephalogram (EEG), researchers were
   unable to access or measure electrical activity that occurs in the
   brain during all states of consciousness. It was once assumed that the
   brain simply "shut off" at night--but we now know that's far from true.
   In fact there are varying levels of brain activity that occur during
   different stages of sleep. As we cycle through different sleep stages,
   the brain shifts between distinct brainwave frequencies like alpha,
   theta, delta, and beta--each linked to different levels of awareness,
   rest, and recovery.

A deeper look: dreams in REM

   You can dream in any stage, but most dreaming appears to occur during
   the REM stage. During REM sleep, brain activity most closely resembles
   that of a wakeful state (14). People also tend to remember most of
   their dreams in a REM state, compared to other states, and after REM
   sleep, i.e. a restful, nourishing night of sleep, cognitive function
   improves. This is something you can measure with the Muse headband.

   Interestingly, a study conducted by J. Allan Hobson at the Division of
   Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School proposed that "REM sleep
   dreaming can be viewed as a virtual reality created from our brain's
   devise." In other words, "we sense, we act and we feel" what we dream
   (15). The theory inspired a team of sleep engineers at MIT's Sleep &
   Neurophysiology Lab to investigate if receiving sensory stimuli while
   sleeping could shape our dreams.

dreams, meditation, sleep Muse's sleep stages graph (hypnogram) above shows
the different stages of sleep of participants during their session.


   To do this, they recorded a group of participant's body and brainwave
   patterns while sleeping and computed their sleep stages and sleep
   scores using Muse. While asleep, participants underwent sensory dream
   engineering techniques using Dormio, the first interactive interface
   for sleep. These techniques include; receiving a burst of scent or
   placing a heated eye mask over their eyes (16). So, what did the study
   uncover?
    1. Ameliorated Dream Valence - After introducing pleasurable or
       familiar scents and temperatures, participants showed positive
       affective responses (17) while dreaming that are associated with
       patterns of respiration, heart rate, and muscular activity
       (particularly during REM sleep), improved sleep quality, and mood.
    2. Alleviated Nightmares - Participants showed fewer biomarkers
       associated with nightmares, such as increased and elevated heart
       rate, increased eye movements, increased respiration rate, and the
       interference of REM sleep.

   When you dream, your whole brain is active at some level. However,
   during REM sleep, your prefrontal cortex is less active. This is the
   part of the brain that is responsible for planning and logic. Since
   activity in the prefrontal cortex is lower during REM sleep, we often
   don't recognize the strangeness or implausibility of a dream until we
   wake up (2). This is why your ability to fly or the appearance of
   monsters seems so realistic until you wake up from that dream (or
   nightmare).

Modern theories on dreams

   While the science behind sleep and sleep tracking continues to evolve,
   some modern theories suggest that dreams may not carry deep symbolic
   meaning at all. Instead, they may be the brain's way of stitching
   together fragments of recent memories, thoughts, or emotional
   residue--often from the things we've been thinking about most.

   Still, other researchers argue that dreaming serves a deeper
   function--one that plays a vital role in cognitive health and emotional
   resilience. As we better understand the relationship between sleep and
   mental fitness, tools like Muse allow us to track brain activity in
   real time, revealing how quality sleep can impact focus, stress, and
   recovery.

   Here are three leading theories on why we dream:

1. Memory Consolidation

   Sleep is essential for memory formation. Without enough rest, the brain
   struggles to retain and recall information. Some researchers believe
   that REM sleep--and the dreaming that occurs during it--helps sort,
   store, or even discard memories. In this view, dreaming is like a
   nightly cleanup: clearing space for more relevant information to take
   hold (1).

2. Evolutionary Purpose

   Because dreaming is present in other mammals, some believe it serves an
   evolutionary function. One theory suggests dreams allow us to mentally
   rehearse difficult or threatening situations, helping us become more
   adaptive in waking life. Others propose that dreaming supports
   problem-solving in a safe, altered state--essentially a sandbox for the
   subconscious (2).

3. Emotional Processing

   REM sleep may play a vital role in helping the brain regulate emotions.
   A  study from the Sleep and Neuroimaging Laboratory at Berkeley found
   that during REM sleep, the limbic system--which processes fear and
   emotion--becomes highly active while also working to block negative
   emotions such as fear and anger (18). This process may help reset
   emotional sensitivity, which explains why people who get less REM sleep
   (and therefore dream less) often show more difficulty managing emotions
   in their waking hours.

   So while the exact purpose of dreaming isn't fully proven, the evidence
   suggests it may serve multiple roles across memory, survival, and
   emotional balance--all essential components of mental fitness.

   Even though we may not fully understand why we dream, or how the brain
   pulls it off so vividly, what we do know is this: dreams aren't just
   stories we sleep through. They're a sign that the brain is working,
   adapting, and healing in the background. And thanks to tools like Muse
   and digital sleeping pills, we don't have to leave that mystery
   entirely in the dark.

   Start tracking today, and start improving your mental fitness by
   starting with your sleep!

Frequently asked questions about dreams & the brain

   What happens in the brain when we dream?

   When we dream, especially during REM sleep, brain activity increases in
   regions like the amygdala (emotion), hippocampus (memory), and visual
   cortex (imagery), while the prefrontal cortex (logic) quiets down. This
   combination allows dreams to be vivid, emotional, and often surreal.

   What part of the brain controls dreaming?

   Dreams are shaped by a network of brain regions, including the default
   mode network (DMN), parietal lobes (spatial awareness), and the
   temporo-parietal junction (linked to self-awareness and lucid
   dreaming). There is no single "dream center."

   How long do dreams last?

   Most dreams last between 5 to 20 minutes, and you can have several
   dreams throughout the night, especially during longer REM sleep cycles
   in the second half of your sleep.

   Can you control your dreams?

   Yes--this is called lucid dreaming. It happens when the dreamer becomes
   aware they're dreaming and may even influence the dream's direction.
   Lucid dreaming is often linked to activity in the temporo-parietal
   junction (TPJ).

   Why don't we remember our dreams?

   You're more likely to remember a dream if you wake up during or right
   after REM sleep. Low activity in the prefrontal cortex during REM may
   also limit the brain's ability to encode dream content into long-term
   memory.

   Does dreaming serve a purpose?

   While still debated, current research suggests dreaming may support
   emotional regulation, memory consolidation, and problem-solving. Some
   scientists also believe it helps the brain "reset" emotional responses
   after stressful experiences.

   Grace Richardson is now the first openly gay Miss England, organisers
   said

   A woman who was bullied at school for being gay has said she has
   "achieved her dream" after being crowned Miss England.

   Grace Richardson said she suffered constant teasing due to her
   sexuality while at school in Leicestershire.

   The musical theatre student, from Leicester, said she was proud to have
   ignored the negativity, going on to win the prize after entering the
   competition for only the second time.

   She is now the first openly gay Miss England, after being crowned at an
   event in Wolverhampton on Friday.

   Miss Richardson, who will now represent England at Miss World 2026,
   said she was bullied "horrendously" while at school.

   She said: "So I was 15 when I came out. It was just after Covid and my
   peers at school just really weren't very nice to me, which definitely
   took a bit of a toll on my mental health.

   "I used to get picked on for countless things, being too skinny, being
   really short and then becoming really tall.

   "It's almost like everything I did was wrong.

   "So it's nice being able to stand up now and say, 'look at what I've
   done'.

   "I've ignored everything negative that they said to me and actually
   I've gone on to achieve my dreams."

   The 20-year-old was one of 12 women to qualify for the final round of
   the competition, having won the "talent" category.

   She was set to perform a ballet dance, but broke her foot the week
   after entering the event, and so used another of her musical theatre
   talents to impress the judges.

   Her rendition of Never Enough by Loren Allred, a song from The Greatest
   Showman, saw her take top prize.

   The Leicester College of Performing Arts student will now fly the
   England flag at Miss World, which is set to take place early next year
   in a location yet to be announced.

   She could become the first British winner of the competition since
   1983.

   "It would be absolutely incredible to be able to bring Miss World back
   to England, but you never know how it's going to go," she said.

     Dreams are the guiding words of the soul. Why should I henceforth
     not love my dreams and not make their riddling images into objects
     of my daily consideration?

     Carl Jung, The Red Book

   Last weekend, I had a dream that mystified me so much that I had to
   analyze it.

   This article describes a step-by-step process in dream interpretation
   based on Carl Jung's work. If you've ever wanted to understand your
   dreams, I recommend a good book to get you started.

   But first, I want to tell you about the dream.

The Dream

   I'm at work in an open-concept office where cubicles are in an assembly
   line formation. Each cubicle shares a middle partition with a
   mirror-cubicle on the other side. In this dream, I'm sitting on one
   side, while my co-worker Phillip is sitting opposite me on the other
   side.

   "Hey Jonah, do you want to sit beside me, or do you want to stay where
   you are on your side?" Phillip asks.

   As I'm debating the pros/cons of where I should sit, Reid, my boss,
   comes over and says, "Jonah, can I see you in my office?"

   So, I walk into his office, and I see a leather club chair. As I walk
   closer, I realize that the chair is teeming with ants and some sticky
   substance like honey or tree sap. I couldn't tell which.

   "How am I going to sit on that? I would have to clean that off first."
   I said to myself.

   Then, I woke up.

   I usually don't remember my dreams, but this one was so vivid that I
   excitedly recounted it to my partner that Sunday morning. Later in the
   day, we walked around the Baltimore Inner Harbor, stopped at the newly
   opened Whole Foods at Harbor East, and decided to sit by the water for
   a bit. Picking a spot, I sat down on a wood bench. I looked down and
   couldn't believe my eyes. Ants. I saw the ants from my dream.

Where Do Dreams Come From?

   In my research for this article, I was surprised that even in the 21st
   century, the "why" and "how" of dreams are largely undeveloped from the
   time of Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung. Of the two, I was attracted to
   Carl Jung's theory. He considered dreams to be messages from the
   unconscious:

     "Dreams are impartial, spontaneous products of the unconscious
     psyche, outside the control of the will. They are pure nature; they
     show us the unvarnished, natural truth, and are therefore fitted, as
     nothing else is, to give us back an attitude that accords with our
     basic human nature when our consciousness has strayed too far from
     its foundations and run into an impasse."

     Carl Jung, CW 10:317

   This is an exciting finding as I'm already curious about synchronicity
   and mythology. Now I can add dreams and the unconscious to the mix of
   mysteries.

   If dreams are messages from the unconscious, then what was my
   unconscious trying to say?

A Warning about Dream Analysis

   But before we begin, a word of caution. Dream analysis engages the
   unconscious, and it might bring up contents you don't want to face.
   It's not a game. Here's what Jung had to say about it:

     We are greatly mistaken if we think that the unconscious is
     something harmless that could be made into an object of
     entertainment, a parlour game. Certainly the unconscious is not
     always and in all circumstances dangerous, but as soon as a neurosis
     is present it is a sign of a special heaping up of energy in the
     unconscious, like a charge that may explode. Here caution is
     indicated. One never knows what one may be releasing when one begins
     to analyse dreams. Something deeply buried and invisible may thereby
     be set in motion, very probably something that would have come to
     light sooner or later anyway--but again, it might not. It is as if
     one were digging an artesian well and ran the risk of stumbling on a
     volcano. When neurotic symptoms are present one must proceed very
     carefully.

     Carl Jung, CW 7:192

   In other words, please be careful. Stop if you sense that something is
   wrong. And if you are still interested in exploring dream
   interpretation, why not see a Jungian analyst in your area? That would
   be a good idea.

Step-by-Step Process for Interpreting Dreams

   The steps below are from a Jungian psychotherapist, Robert Johnson, who
   wrote Inner Work: Using Dreams and Active Imagination for Personal
   Growth (affiliate link). I read this book four years ago but had no
   interest in writing about it until now.
    1. Write the Dream in Detail
    2. Make Associations
    3. Connect Dream Images to What's Happening Internally
    4. Interpret the Dream
    5. Do a Ritual to Make the Dream Concrete

Step 1 Write the Dream in Detail

   Write your dream immediately after waking up. Otherwise, you will
   forget. In the article Follow Your Bliss, I recommend keeping a
   journal. Dreams would be a great addition to that journal.

   Write down all the dream details even if they appear unimportant:
   setting, people, objects, dialogue, smells, sounds, color, and your
   "internal talk" and emotions while dreaming the dream.

Step 2 Make Associations

   The next step is to make associations. Think of the dream image and
   then write down everything that comes to mind. For example, in my
   dream, the "work setting" symbolized drudgery, stress, and competition.
   Do this for every dream detail you wrote down in your journal.

   Don't consult a dream dictionary. Dream symbols are unique to you, so
   there is no sense in asking other people or reading about it. The only
   exception is if the dream contains archetypal motifs common to the
   human race. These would include characters like father, mother, child,
   wise old man, hero, maiden, or trickster. With archetypes, it doesn't
   matter whether you are white, black, or brown. We come from the same
   ground and live and die under the same blue sky, so the meaning of
   archetypes will be the same.

Step 3 Connect Dream Images to What's Happening Internally

   Just like when reading mythology, dreams are not meant to be
   interpreted literally. The language of dreams and the unconscious is
   the symbolic image. Therefore, the unconscious borrows images from your
   external environment to symbolize things in the dream. For example, in
   my dream, the characters Phillip and Reid do not actually refer to the
   real counterparts. Each character represents something else. Thus,
   dreams are usually about the interior world rather than the external
   one.

Step 4 Interpret the Dream

   Taking all the things you wrote before, interpret the dream. Remember
   that a dream is a coherent message from the unconscious cloaked in
   symbolism. When you interpret the dream and arrive at an interpretation
   that "clicks" or makes you say "a-ha," then you're on the right path. A
   couple of caveats:
     * Your unconscious will not send you a message that you already know
       or are conscious of. Thus the dream's message should be a surprise
       to you.
     * If you arrive at a dream interpretation that is self-congratulatory
       and self-inflating, then that interpretation is probably incorrect.
     * If you arrive at an interpretation that blames others, then that
       interpretation is also incorrect. Dreams are about you and not
       others. Remember that all the characters in your dream represent
       aspects of yourself, even if they look like somebody you know.

Step 5 Do a Ritual to Make the Dream Concrete

   After interpreting the dream, honor it by doing something physical (and
   not just thinking about it). By doing something physical, you integrate
   the dream, which was unconscious, into your conscious waking life. The
   ritual is a way to send the message to your unconscious that you heard
   it. Write in your journal, pray, light a candle, or make art out of it.
   The physical act should not be loud or expensive. The smaller and the
   more intimate, the better.

My Dream Interpretation

   Now, I'm going to apply these steps to my dream. I cover a number of
   symbols from my dream: the work setting, the mirror-cubicle setup, my
   co-worker Phillip, my boss Reid, the leather club chair, the ants, and
   honey/tree sap. This is a work in progress, so the final interpretation
   may change the more I think about the dream in the coming days.

The Symbol of Work Setting

   The work setting confused me for a long time. I associated it with my
   accounting job, but I quit that last October to be a full-time artist.
   So, why did this dream show that I was back at my accounting job? That
   didn't make any sense to me. Then it hit me: the work setting was a
   symbol. My unconscious borrowed the image of my former accounting job
   to symbolize my current job as an artist. Once I realized what the work
   setting meant, some of the other associations fell into place.

The Symbol of Mirror-Cubicle Setup

   I wrote down many associations for the mirror-cubicle setup but none
   clicked, so I set it aside and focused on my co-worker Phillip.

The Symbol of Phillip

   What did Phillip represent? After going over many associations, the
   following clicked. Phillip is a real person, and a long time ago as
   part of a get-to-know session at a company retreat, he shared with
   everyone that he was related to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the writer of
   Sherlock Holmes. Suddenly, the mirror-cubicle setup made sense! Phillip
   represented the writer side of my psyche. Phillip sat directly opposite
   me. What the dream was really asking was, "Hey Jonah, do you want to be
   a writer, or do you want to stay where you are on your side?"

The Symbol of Reid

   This "writer" interpretation solidified when I considered Reid. Reid is
   also a very real person, but not my real boss. Reid Callanan is the
   director of the Santa Fe Photographic Workshops. I've never met Reid,
   and yet here he was in my dream personifying photography.

The Symbol of the Leather Club Chair

   I associate the leather club chair with comfort, luxury, wealth, or a
   man-cave. The association that resonated the most was luxury. That
   luxurious leather chair invited me to sink into and be enveloped by it.
   It occurred to me that it was like the snake that appears in many
   mythologies around the world. The leather club chair was a trickster or
   troublemaker. This is the only dream detail that feels archetypal. Is
   this the definitive interpretation? I'm not feeling a click or an a-ha
   yet, but it feels very close.

The Symbol of the Ants

   I tried many associations for the ants and honey/tree sap, separately
   and together. I was stumped on this one. I took a break and walked
   outside. I think I was afraid of what I might discover if I continued
   interpreting the dream. I wanted the dream to have a positive outcome,
   I have to admit that.

   I wrote about the associations in my journal over a couple of days
   after the dream. In the end, the following strangely resonated:
     * The leather club chair is in Reid's office and, therefore,
       represents the photography world.
     * The leather chair is like the archetypal snake as temptation
       inviting me to sit down, BUT
     * I can't sit on the chair because it was overflowing with ants that
       bite.
     * In addition, the sticky tree sap could trap me like a Venus
       flytrap, and I would be unable to get up from the chair.

What Does this Dream Mean?

   Taking all the above into account, I now believe that this dream is
   sending a message that there is a tug-of-war between photography and
   writing in the interior landscape of my unconscious. I was not aware of
   this, but I sense that this conclusion is true. The dream seems to be
   saying that I should not sit on the photography chair because of the
   biting ants and the sticky tree sap. I hesitated moving to the writer
   chair, so that appears out as well. The dream is saying that I have to
   find my own path: it's not photography, and it's not writing.

   What is interesting about the dream is that it actually had three
   chairs: the chair I was sitting on at the beginning of the dream, the
   writer chair, and the photographer chair. The question now is, what
   did the first chair represent? I don't know. No other characters spoke
   during the dream. I will have to think about it in the coming days.
   Usually in dream interpretation, the unconscious leaves a little clue
   as to what the solution is, but it's escaping me at the moment.

   In the meantime, I completed a ritual to acknowledge this dream. I
   created cyanotype art from it.

Interested in Analyzing Your Dream?

   I hope you found this article helpful in describing how to interpret a
   dream. This article barely scratches the surface of Carl Jung dream
   analysis approach. To know more, I highly recommend reading Johnson's
   Inner Work: Using Dreams and Active Imagination for Personal
   Growth (affiliate link). Good luck!

Update: The Symbol of The Third Chair!

   I had another dream on August 6, 2020, that clarified the meaning of
   the third chair. Read The Dream That Changed My Life.

       I've always been fascinated with dream interpretations, so I'm glad
       to hear about the Jungian approach. I didn't know about the rituals
       to reinforce the dreams, so I'll dig a bit deeper into them.

   Dreams can feel stunningly real, leave us shaken, and surprise us with
   their surreal storylines. But do they actually mean anything? Sigmund
   Freud, the famed neurologist and founder of modern-day psychoanalysis,
   had a lot to say about how we might interpret the visual, emotional,
   and cognitive sensations we experience while asleep. He believed our
   dreams are actually the disguised representations of our unconscious
   desires, thoughts, wishes, and motivations. It's a theory is still very
   much alive today.

   "Throughout history, there has been both fascination and debate about
   what dreams are, what causes them, what they mean, and the benefit they
   may carry," wellness astrologer and author of "The Complete Book of
   Dreams" Stephanie Gailing explains. "Since antiquity, they have
   maintained a very important role in cultures across the globe, revered
   for their visionary wisdom."

   The act of trying to suss out the possible meaning of dreams can be
   traced as far back as the ancient Sumerian civilization, when many
   people used them as prophetic guides and to help them make important
   decisions. According to Gailing, it wasn't until the early 20th
   century--and the birth of modern psychology--that dreams were seen as a
   reflection of the subconscious. Nowadays, it's common to interpret
   dreams in order to better understand our overall well-being.

   Thea Gallagher, PsyD, clinical associate professor of psychiatry at NYU
   Langone Health, breaks down dreams, which typically occur in the rapid
   eye movement (REM) sleep stage where images or stories play out in our
   minds, into three types: a pleasant dream with an ideal outcome, one
   with a less preferred outcome (or oftentimes a bizarre one), and a
   nightmare. What these dreams mean is personal and can vary; it all
   depends on the dreamer.

   "Dreams can show us things that we are experiencing in waking life but
   are not acknowledged in our conscious minds," explains Gailing. "Either
   because we don't have space to process them or we don't want to deal
   with certain feelings or thoughts."

   Though the interpretation of dreams will be different for everyone,
   there are universal themes that pop up and are worth looking into if
   you're trying to figure out what you're own dreams might mean. Consider
   this your crash course in basic dream analysis--or, a handy little
   dream dictionary, just for you. Read on for 14 of the most common types
   of dreams and what they could mean for you.

Dreams of Being Pregnant

   Depending on what is going on in your life, being pregnant in a dream
   can mean totally different things. Gailing says it's important to look
   at the details of your dream to help flesh out the overall meaning.
   You'll also want to explore how you're feeling after the dream; she
   says your emotional reaction can provide insights into what the dream
   might mean to you personally.

   "For example, if you have a dream about being pregnant, and you have
   been working hard on a creative project, the dream may relate to this
   period of creativity you are experiencing and how you feel about it,"
   she explains. "It's always important to take the dream into context of
   what is happening in a person's waking life."

Dreams of Falling

   If you're dreaming about being in a free fall, Gailing says it could
   mean that you feel out of control and don't "have steady footing" in
   some aspect of your life. On the other end of that spectrum, however,
   she says that if you find yourself falling in a dream but then start
   flying, it could represent freedom and trusting the timing of your
   life.

Dreams of Being Chased

   Someone chasing you in your dreams is another sign that you might not
   feel in control. Gailing says it could signify a couple of different
   fears, such as concern that someone is out to get you or that you're
   avoiding certain responsibilities.

Dreams of Flying

   Whether you're dreaming of flying like a bird or cos-playing your
   favorite Marvel superhero, Gailing says that the vivid dream of flying
   symbolizes freedom and a need for adventure. However if the dream turns
   into you falling as you fly, it could also mean you feel ungrounded. So
   remember to try to pay attention to what's going on in the dream and
   how you feel.

Dreams of Death

   An obvious reading, Gailing says, of dreaming about death is that it
   could signify your internal fear about dying. But here's another way
   she says that you can look at it: it could just be giving you a sense
   that a chapter or situation in your life is coming to an end--and that
   doesn't always have to be a bad thing.

Dreams of Your Teeth Falling Out

   One of the most common dreams people tend to have is one that involves
   teeth falling out. Gailing says that there are three main dream
   interpretations for this. First, it could signify some sort of rebirth
   and transformation, as you're releasing something old and making space
   for something new. The other two are more introspective and could
   signify feeling some sort of loss of control or internal concerns about
   how you present in public.

Dreams of Being Late or Missing a Deadline

   These habits of tardiness showing up in your dreams usually shows some
   sort of worry you have internally. Gailing says that it could represent
   worrying about a lost opportunity or stress around your relationship
   with time. It could also show that you're overwhelmed by being
   overcommitted with responsibilities.

Dreams of Being Naked in Public

   Have you recently fallen flat on your face while walking through a
   crowd? Or accidentally liked an old photo of an ex while on a social
   media (read: stalking) deep dive? If you're not one to brush it off and
   keep it moving, those embarrassed feelings may manifest in dreamland as
   you sleep. If you find yourself dreaming about being naked in public,
   Gailing says it's most likely connected to a recent embarrassing
   situation you've found yourself in.

Dreams of Infidelity

   The good news: dreaming of infidelity isn't necessarily a sign from the
   universe that you're with the wrong person or that you're tapping into
   some psychic ability to predict the demise of your current
   relationship. The bad news: you might be dealing with trust issues in
   general and operating from a place of fear. Both Gallagher and Gailing
   say that if you're not feeling secure or have been betrayed in the
   past, it's normal to have those subconscious feelings of distrust creep
   up. Maybe you're having this dream because a partner has cheated on you
   in the past or you're scared something will ruin a beautiful current
   connection. Just remember, it's important to ground yourself rather
   than lash out over this particular dream.

   "Relationships are one [thing] that can conjure up a lot of uncertainty
   because we don't know...there's so many things that could happen in a
   relationship," says Gallagher. "I think if it's really something that
   has no evidence based in the present, it's about saying `I got to live
   my life' and engage with this without knowing every possible outcome."

Dreams of Phobias

   No one wants to see insects or any sort of creature they're afraid of
   while they're sleeping. So why is your unconscious mind doing you dirty
   in your dreams? Gailing says that if you're dreaming of your phobias,
   you're most likely afraid of not having control in some situation in
   your life. "[You're] face to face with something that haunts or scares
   you," she says.

   She adds that certain animals and what those animals are doing
   represent different types of fears. For example, a rat could reflect
   that you're hiding or shunning something.

Dreams of Your Ex

   Don't let the TikTok tarot cards fool you: a dream about your ex isn't
   their way of manifesting you back into their lives. So before you undo
   all that healing by breaking the "no contact rule," both Gailing and
   Thea want you to take a step back and evaluate your feelings
   surrounding that dream. "Were you thrilled, horrified, or puzzled that
   your ex starred in your dream? Also, what's your relationship with your
   ex? Do you never want to see them again [or] do you pine for them? Do
   you regret or feel shame that you broke up? The context is super
   important here in understanding what the dream is revealing," says
   Gailing.

   Once you process your feelings about the dream (and your ex), you can
   then determine whether or not you're harboring any unresolved emotions
   about the relationship. Gallagher says it's normal to think about
   people in your past who you've had a significant relationship with, but
   it doesn't always have to a deeper meaning about the specific person.
   "What do you want to do about [the dream]?" asks Gallagher. "Sometimes
   people struggle with `I regret that I broke up with this person' or `I
   feel sadness that they cheated on me.' [They also think], `I just feel
   like it was the wrong time, wrong place, and what could have been.' I
   think processing those feelings is really important with our
   relationships."

Dreams that Feel Like a Premonition

   Better known as precognitive dreams, Gailing says, "These are the ones
   in which you dream of an event that has yet to occur, only for it to
   happen later. Some people [believe] that they are able to foretell the
   future through their dreams while others don't sense that their dreams
   are precognitive until after an event that they dreamed about occurs."

   But not every dream is a precognitive dream and you shouldn't live in
   fear thinking you've predicted your future every time you sleep.
   Instead, she says to just take note of times when your dreams come into
   fruition and  "Embrace the power of [your] intuition and ability to
   hone in on subtle perceptions of awareness," she says. In other words,
   this is a great way to "further develop this skill."

   Gallagher agrees and says to have fun with it. "It doesn't have to be
   that serious or deep," she says. "I think [it] could be something
   that's kind of neat and fun. [It could] sometimes make us feel
   connected to a greater sense of our consciousness."

Dreams of Seeing a Loved One Who Has Passed Away

   When Gallagher's sister passed and visited her in a dream, Gallagher
   says she focused on the fact that it gave her a chance to create
   another memory with a person she misses dearly instead of trying to
   figure out whether her sister was sending her a message from the great
   beyond. This is something she encourages others to do as well.
   "Sometimes it's really nice to have that experience where you maybe
   connect with someone you've lost in a dream," she says. "It was such a
   beautiful experience to have this kind of dream with my sister in it."

   If you're feeling anxious or stressed after being visited by a lost
   loved one in your dreams, Gallagher recommends working through those
   feelings with a trusted friend, family member, or therapist. It might
   prove to be a meaningful moment of reflection and insight. "Dreams
   reflect things in our lives that are very much connected to strong
   emotions; it's no surprise that sometimes those will show up in our
   dreams," she says. "I think that can be a beautiful thing."

Dreams of Your Losing Hair

   Gailing says that dreams of losing one's hair may be linked to some
   sort of worry you might have. This will be dependent on what's going on
   in your life, but some common meanings behind this include loss of
   control, worrying about aging, or worrying about your appearance.

Dreams of Fires

   Dreaming about fires has a wide range of meanings. One of the most
   common interpretations of this type of destruction, says Gailing, is
   that you're in a situation where you have no power. It can also
   represent feelings of great passion or your anger towards something (or
   someone) in your life. On the flipside, it could mean some sort of
   purification and clearing away of the old.

Dreams of Drowning

   According to Gailing, water oftentimes symbolizes emotions of feeling
   overwhelmed or consumed with something. This could mean too much
   pressure from a situation, too much work, too much responsibility in
   something, etc. "Basically whatever in your waking life that you feel
   like you're drowning in," she says.

Dreams of Snakes

   Snakes in general, says Gailing, are associated with some sort of
   transformation and metamorphosis.She goes on to explain that if you
   dream about a snake, it may be because you're in a powerful time of
   letting things go and shedding the things you've outgrown. While it
   sounds like a good thing, she says that it can be scary letting go of
   what you've known to invite the unknown.

   Other things that the snake might represent include a form of healing
   (she points out that the modern symbol associated with medicine
   features two snakes and that the symbol associated with the Greek
   father of medicine Asclepius is a staff with a snake circling around it
   ), passion, or a sign someone around you is being deceitful or
   untrustworthy.

Nightmares

   While not pleasant, nightmares can clue you in to any unresolved
   emotional conflicts that you might be carrying around. "[They] shine a
   light on what it is you are fearful of," says Gailing. "They give us
   the opportunity to process unprocessed feelings."

   For the most part, you don't have to be too concerned with having a
   nightmare. But Gallagher says that if you're having recurring dreams of
   a traumatic event that has happened to you, you should seek out
   professional help to work through it. "It's a clinical symptom," she
   explains. "[A recurring nightmare about a traumatic event] could be
   indicating that you have some `unfinished business' that you have to
   process, which is really important in healing from PTSD."

   If it's a nightmare that you're scared will come true, she says it's
   normal to feel a bit uneasy. But she encourages you to speak with
   someone so that the fears don't affect how you live out your personal
   life.

   Both Gailing and Gallagher encourage those interested in interpreting
   their own dreams to keep a dream journal; this will help recall the
   dreams and make sense of what they might mean to you in the present
   moment. It might just prove to be emotionally helpful, as well. "A
   dream journal offers you a deeper level of understanding about yourself
   and/or the world around you," explains Gailing. "Even if a dream is
   full of fancy or nothing more than a recounting of the day's events...I
   think that opening up to our dreams can leave us in awe and inspire us
   to feel more awe at the complexity and mystery of life."

What is the most common dream?

   Gailing says that she hasn't come across a singular dream that most
   people experience. Instead, she says there are a series of most popular
   themes that have been found amongst people across all different
   cultures. Those include being chased, falling, arriving late, death,
   teeth falling out, flying, and being naked in public.

What does a recurring dream mean?

   It's pretty common to have a recurring dream, says Gailing. This can
   mean a number of different things, such as a sign from our psyche that
   wants us to pay attention to a certain thing or an unresolved issue
   that calls for healing. This might also be a side effect of
   post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), where she says that recurring
   dreams may be the reliving of the traumatic experiences while one
   sleeps.

   When this happens, she recommends journaling about it, or seeing a
   therapist or dream interpreter to discuss it and see what meaning it
   has. The most important thing to do is to pay attention to it. "Often
   by giving it an audience, it will bring the unconscious inspiration to
   light and from there you can work things through on a conscious level,"
   she says. "If there is resolve, then the dream may not appear as
   frequently or may not even appear again (as its job may be complete)."

Why do people dream?

   The million dollar question that no one has a straightforward answer
   to. Gailing says there are many theories on why we dream, such as our
   subconscious taking the time to process the things we can't while we're
   conscious or just chalking it up to normal neurological processes that
   have no real meaning behind them. Many cultures also believe that our
   dreams are ways our spirits and ancestors communicate with us. But just
   as the meaning of our dreams is dependent on our experiences and
   feelings, why we dream in the first place might be a personal answer
   that only you can answer. At least for now.

   "We are such stuff/As dreams are made on, and our little life/Is
   rounded with a sleep."
   -- William Shakespeare, The Tempest (1611)

   "A candy-colored clown they call the sandman/tiptoes to my room every
   night/just to sprinkle stardust and to whisper/'Go to sleep, everything
   is alright.'"
   -- Roy Orbison, "In Dreams" (1963)

   cover Amongst the green-dappled Malvern Hills, where sunlight spools
   onto spring leaves like puddles of water in autumn, a peasant named
   Will is imagined to have fallen asleep on a May day when both the
   warmth and the light induce dreams. Sometime in the late
   fourteenth-century (as near as we can tell between 1370 and 1390), the
   poet William Langland wrote of a character in Piers Plowman who shared
   his name and happened to fall asleep. "In a summer season," Langland
   begins, "when soft was the sun, /I clothed myself in a cloak as I
   shepherd were... And went wide in the world wonders to hear."
   Presentism is a critical vice, a fallacy of misreading yourself into a
   work, supposedly especially perilous if it's one that's nearly seven
   centuries old. Hard not to commit that sin sometimes. "But on a May
   morning," Langland writes, and I note his words those seven centuries
   later on a May afternoon, when the sun is similarly soft, and the
   inevitable drowsiness of warm contentment takes over my own nodding
   head and drowsy eyes so that I can't help but see myself in the opening
   stanza of Piers Plowman.

   "A marvel befell me of fairy, methought./I was weary with wandering and
   went me to rest/Under a broad bank by a brook's side,/And as I lay and
   leaned over and looked into the water/I fell into a sleep for it
   sounded so merry." Good close readers that we are all supposed to be,
   it's imperative that we don't read into the poem things that aren't
   actually in it, and yet I can't help but imagine what that daytime
   nocturn was like. The soft gurgle of a creek through English fields,
   the feeling of damp grass underneath dirtied hands, and of scratchy
   cloak against unwashed skin; the sunlight tanning the backs of his
   eyelids; that dull, corpuscular red of daytime sleep, the warmth of
   day's glow flushing his cheeks, and the almost preternatural quiet save
   for some bird chirping. The sort of sleep you fall into when you're on
   a train that rocks you to sleep in the sunlight of late afternoon. It
   sounds nice.

   cover Piers Plowman is of a medieval poetic genre known as a dream
   allegory, or even more enticingly as a dream vision. Most famous of
   these is Dante Alighieri's The Divine Comedy, where its central
   character (who as in Piers Plowman shares the poet's name) discovers
   himself in a less pleasant wood than does Will, for that "When I had
   journeyed half of our life's way,/I found myself within a shadowed
   forest,/for I had lost the path that does not stray." The Middle Ages
   didn't originate the dream vision, but it was the golden age of the
   form, where poets could express mystical truths in journeys that only
   happened within heads resting upon rough, straw-stuffed pillows.
   Langland's century alone saw Geoffrey Chaucer's Parliament of Fowls,
   John Gower's Vox Clamantis, John Lydgate's The Temple of Glass, and the
   anonymously written Pearl (by the same lady or gent who wrote Sir
   Gawain and the Green Knight). Those are only English examples (or I
   should say examples by the English; Gower was writing in Latin), for
   the form was popular in France and Italy as well. A.C. Spearing
   explains in Medieval Dream-Poetry that while sleeping "we undergo
   experiences in which we are freed from the constraints of everyday
   possibility, and which we feel to have some hidden significance," a
   sentiment which motivated the poetry of Langland and Dante.

   Dante famously claimed that his visions -- of perdition, purgatory, and
   paradise -- were not dreams, and yet everything in The Divine Comedy
   holds to the genre's conventions. Both Langland and Dante engage the
   strange logic of the nocturne, the way in which the subconscious seems
   to rearrange and illuminate reality in a manner that the prosaicness of
   overrated wakefulness simply cannot. Dante writes that the "night hides
   things from us," but his epic is itself proof that the night can just
   as often reveal things. Within The Divine Comedy Dante is guided
   through the nine circles of hell by the Roman poet Virgil, from the
   antechamber of the inferno wherein dwell the righteous pagans and
   classical philosophers, down through the frozen environs of the lowest
   domain whereby Lucifer forever torments and is tormented by that
   trinity of traitors composed of Cassius, Brutus, and Judas. Along the
   way Dante is privy to any number of nightmares, from self-disemboweling
   prophets to lovers forever buffeted around on violent winds (bearing no
   similarity to a gentle Malvern breeze). In the Purgatorio and Paradiso
   he is spectator to far more pleasant scenes (though telling that more
   people have read Inferno, as our nightmares are always easiest to
   remember), whereby he sees a heaven that's the "color that paints the
   morning and evening clouds that face the sun," almost a description of
   the peacefulness of accidentally nodding off on an early summer day.

   Both The Divine Comedy and Piers Plowman express verities accessed by
   the mind in repose; Langland's poem, for not beginning in a dark wood
   but rather in a sunny field, embodies mystical apprehensions as surely
   as does Dante. A key difference is that Langland's allegory is so
   obvious (as anyone who has seen the medieval play Everyman can attest
   is true of the period). Characters named after the Seven Deadly Sins,
   or called Patience, Clergy, and Scripture (and Old Age, Death, and
   Pestilence) all interact with Will -- whose name has its own obvious
   implications. By contrast, Dante's characters bear a resemblance to
   actual people (or they are actual people, from Aristotle in Limbo to
   Thomas Aquinas in Heaven), even while the events depicted are seemingly
   more fantastic (though in Piers Plowman Will witness both the fall of
   man and the harrowing of hell). Both are, however, written in the
   substance of dreams. Forget the didactic obviousness of allegory, the
   literal cipher that defines that form, and believe that in a field
   between Worcestershire and Hertfordshire Will did plumb the mysteries
   of eternity while sleeping. What makes the dream vision a chimerical
   form is that maybe he did. That's the thing with dreams and their
   visions; there is no need to suspend disbelief. We're not in the realm
   of fantasy or myth, for in dreams order has been abolished, anything is
   possible, and nothing is prohibited, not even flouting the arid rules
   of logic.

   A danger to this, for to dream is to court the absolute when we're at
   our most vulnerable, to find eternity in a sleep. Piers Plowman had the
   taint of heresy about it, as it inspired the revolutionaries of 1381's
   Peasant Rebellion, as well as the adherents of a schismatic group of
   proto-Protestants known as Lollards. Arguably the crushing of the
   rebellion led to an attendant attack by authorities on vernacular
   literature like Piers Plowman, in part explaining the general
   dismalness of English literature in the fifteenth-century (which
   excluding Mallory and Skelton is the worst century of writing).
   Scholars have long debated the relationship between Langland and
   Lollardy, but we'll let others more informed tease out those
   connections[. T]he larger point is that dreaming can get you in
   trouble. That's because dreaming is the only realm in which we're
   simultaneously complete sovereign and lowly subject; the cinema we
   watch when our eyes are closed. Sleep is a domain that can't be reached
   by monarch, tyrant, state, or corporation -- it is our realm.

   cover Dreams had a radical import in George Orwell's dystopian classic
   1984. You'll recall that in that novel the main character of Winston
   Smith is a minor bureaucrat in totalitarian Oceania. Every aspect of
   Smith's life is carefully controlled; his life is under total
   surveillance, all speech is regulated (or made redundant by New Speak),
   and even the truth is censored, altered, and transformed (which the
   character himself has a role in). Yet his dreams are one aspect of his
   life which the government can't quite control, for Smith "had dreamed
   that he was walking through a pitch-dark room. And someone sitting to
   one side of him had said as he passed: `We shall meet in the place
   where there is no darkness.'" Sleep is an anarchic space where the
   dreamer is at the whims of something much larger and more powerful than
   themselves, and by contrast where sometimes the dreamer finds
   themselves transformed into a god. A warning here though -- when total
   independence erupts from our skulls into the wider world (for after
   all, it is common to mutter in one's sleep) there is the potential that
   your unconsciousness can betray you. Smith, after all, is always
   monitored by his telescreen.

   Whether it's the thirteenth or the twenty-first centuries, dreaming
   remains bizarre. Whether we reduce dreams to messages from the gods and
   the dead, or repressed memories and neurosis playing in the nursery of
   our unconscious, or simply random electric flickering of neurons, the
   fact that we spend long stretches of our life submerging ourselves in
   bizarre parallel dimensions is so odd that I can't help but wonder why
   we don't talk about it more (beyond painful conversations recounting
   dreams). So strange is it that we spend a third of our lives journeying
   to fantastic realms where every law of spatiality and temporality and
   every axiom of identity and principle of logic is flouted, that you'd
   think we'd conduct ourselves with a bit more humility when dismissing
   that which seems fantastic in the experience of those from generations
   past who've long since gone to eternal sleep. Which is just to wonder
   that when William Langland dreamt, is it possible that he dreamt of me?

   Even with our advancements in the modern scientific study of the
   phenomenon, their mysteriousness hasn't entirely dissipated. If our
   ancestors saw in dreams portents and prophecies, then this oracular
   aspect was only extended by Sigmund Freud's The Interpretation of
   Dreams. He who inaugurated the nascent field of psychoanalysis
   explained dreams as a complex tapestry of wish fulfillment and
   sublimation, an encoded narrative that mapped onto the patient's waking
   life and that could be deciphered by the trained therapist. Freud
   writes that there "exists a psychological technique by which dreams may
   be interpreted and that upon the application of this method every dream
   will show itself to be a senseful psychological structure which may be
   introduced into an assignable place in the psychic activity of the
   waking state." Not so different from Will sleeping in his field. The
   origin may be different -- Langland sees in dreams visions imparted
   from God and Freud finds their origin in the holy unconsciousness, but
   the idea isn't dissimilar. Dreaming imparts an ordered and ultimately
   comprehensible message, even though the imagery may be cryptic.

   Freud has been left to us literary critics (who've even grown tired of
   him over the past generation), and science has abandoned terms like id,
   ego, and superego in favor of neurons and biochemistry, synapses and
   serotonin. For neurologists, dreaming is a function of the prefrontal
   cortex powering down during REM sleep, and of the hippocampus severing
   its waking relationship with the neocortex, allowing for a bit of a
   free-for-all in the brain. Scientists have discovered much about how
   and why dreaming happens -- what parts of the brain are involved, what
   cycles of wakefulness and restfulness a person will experience, when
   dreaming evolved, and what functions (if any) it could possibly serve.
   Gone are the simple reductionisms of dream interpretation manuals with
   their categorized entries about your teeth falling out or of showing up
   naked to your high school biology final. Neuroscientists favor a more
   sober view of dreaming, whereby random bits of imagery and thought
   thrown out by your groggy chemical induced brain rearrange themselves
   into a narrative which isn't really a narrative. Still, as Andrea Rock
   notes in The Mind at Night: The New Science of How and Why we Dream,
   "it's impossible for scientists to agree on something as seemingly
   simple as the definition of dreaming." If we're such stuff as dreams
   are made of, the forensics remain inconclusive.

   cover Not that dreaming is exclusively a human activity. Scientists
   have been able to demonstrate that all mammals have some form of
   nocturnal hallucination, from gorillas to duck-billed platypuses,
   dolphins to hamsters. Anyone with a dog has seen their friend fall into
   a deep reverie; their legs pump as if they're running, occasionally
   they'll even startle-bark themselves awake. One summer day my wife and
   I entertained our French bulldog by having her chase a sprinkler's
   spray. She flapped her jowly face at the cool gush of water with a
   happiness that no human is capable of. That evening, while she was
   asleep, she began to flap her mouth again, finally settling into a
   deeper reverie where she just smiled. Dreaming may not necessarily be a
   mammalian affair -- there are indications that both birds and reptiles
   dream -- albeit it's harder to study creatures more distant from us.
   Regardless, evidence is that animals have been sleeping perchance to
   dream for a very long time, as it turns out. Rock writes that "Because
   the more common forms of mammals we see today branched off from the
   monotreme line about 140 million years ago... REM sleep as it exists in
   most animals also emerged at about the time that split occurred." We
   don't know if dinosaurs dreamt, but something skittering around and out
   of the way of their feet certainly did.

   cover If animal brains are capable of generating pyrotechnic missives,
   and if dreaming goes back to the Cretaceous, what then of the future of
   dreaming? If dogs and donkeys, cats and camels are capable of dreaming,
   will artificial intelligences dream? This is the question asked by
   Philip K. Dick`s Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, which was itself
   the source material for Ridley Scott's science fiction film classic
   Blade Runner. Dick was an author as obsessed with illusion and reality,
   the unattainability of truth, and doubt as much as any writer since
   Plato.[DEL: :DEL] In his novel's account of the bounty hunter Rick
   Deckard's decommissioning of sentient androids, there is his usual
   examination of what defines consciousness, and the ways in which its
   illusions can present realities. "Everything is true... Everything
   anybody has ever thought," one character says, a pithy encapsulation of
   the radical potential of dreams. Dick imagined robots capable of
   dreaming with such verisimilitude that they misapprehended themselves
   to be human, but as it turns out our digital tools are able to slumber
   in silicon.

   Computer scientists at Google have investigated what random images are
   produced by a complex artificial neural network as it "dreams,"
   allowing the devices to filter various images they've encountered and
   to recombine, recontextualize, and regenerate new pictures. In The
   Atlantic, Adrienne LaFrance writes that the "computer-made images
   feature scrolls of color, swirling lines, stretched faces, floating
   eyeballs, and uneasy waves of shadow and light. The machines seemed to
   be hallucinating, and in a way that appeared uncannily human."
   Artificial Intelligence has improved to an unsettling degree in just
   the past decade, even though a constructed mind capable of easily
   passing the Turing Test has yet to be created, though that seems more
   an issue of time than possibility. If all of the flotsam and jetsam of
   the internet could coalesce into a collective consciousness emerging
   from the digital primordial like some archaic demigod birthing Herself
   from chaos, what dreams could be generated therein? Or if it's possible
   to program a computer, a robot, an android, an automaton to dream, then
   what oracles of Artificial Intelligence could be birthed? I can't help
   but thrill to the idea that we'll be able to program a desktop version
   of the Delphic Oracle analyzing its own microchipped dreams. "The
   electric things have their life too," Dick wrote.

   We've already developed AI capable of generating completely
   realistic-looking but totally fictional women and men. Software
   engineer Philip Wang invented a program at ThisPersonDoesNotExist.com
   which does exactly what its title advertises itself as doing: it gives
   you a picture of a person who doesn't exist. Using an algorithm that
   combs through actual images, Wang's site uses something called a
   generative adversarial network to create pictures of people who never
   lived. If you refresh the site, you'll see that the humans dreamt of by
   the neural network aren't cartoons or caricatures, but photorealistic
   images so accurate that they look like they could be used for a
   passport. So far I've been presented with an attractive butch woman
   with sparkling brown eyes, a broad smile, and short curly auburn hair;
   a strong jawed man in his 30s with an unfortunate bowl cut and a day's
   worth of stubble who looks a bit like swimmer Michael Phelps; and a
   nerdy-looking Asian man with a pleasant smile and horn-rimmed glasses.
   Every single person the AI presented looked completely average and
   real, so that if I encountered them in the grocery store or at
   Starbucks I wouldn't think twice, and yet not a single one of them was
   real. I'd read once (though I can't remember where) that every invented
   person we encounter in our dreams has a corollary to somebody that we
   once met briefly in real life, a waitress or a store clerk whose paths
   we crossed for a few minutes drudged up from the unconscious and
   commissioned into our narrative. I now think that all of those people
   come from ThisPersonDoesNotExist.com.

   One fictional person who reoccurs in many of our dreams is "This Man,"
   a pudgy, unattractive balding man with thick eyebrows, and an
   approachable smile who was the subject of Italian marketer Andrea
   Natella's now defunct website "Ever Dream This Man?" According to
   Natella, scores of people had dreams about the man (occasionally
   nightmares) across all continents and in dozens of countries. Blake
   Butler, writing in Vice Magazine, explains that "His presence seems
   both menacing and foreboding at the same time, unclear in purpose, but
   haunting to those in whom he does appear." This Man doesn't
   particularly look like any famous figure, nor is he so generic that his
   presence can be dismissed as mere coincidence. A spooky resonance
   concerns this guy who looks like he manages a diner on First Avenue and
   65^th emerging simultaneously in thousands of peoples' dreams (his
   cameo is far less creepy after you're aware of the website). Multiple
   hypotheses were proffered, ranging from This Man being the product of
   the collective unconscious as described by Carl Jung to Him being a
   manifestation of God appearing to people from Seattle to Shanghai (my
   preferred theory). As it turns out, he was simply the result of a viral
   marketing campaign.

   Meme campaigns aside, the sheer weirdness of dreams can't quite
   exorcize them of a supernatural import -- we're all looking for
   portents, predictions, and prophecies. Being submerged into what's
   effectively another universe can't help but alter our sense of reality,
   or at least make us question what exactly that word means. For years
   now I've had dreams that take place in the same recurring location -- a
   detailed, complex, baroque alternate version of my hometown of
   Pittsburgh. This parallel universe Pittsburgh roughly maps onto the
   actual place, though it appears much larger and there are notable
   differences. Downtown, for example, is a network of towering,
   interconnected skyscrapers all accessible from within one another
   (there's a good bookstore there); a portion of Squirrel Hill is given
   over to a Wild West experience set. It's not that I have the same
   dreams about this place, it's that the place is the same, regardless of
   what happens to me in those dreams when I'm there. So much so that I
   experience the uncanny feeling of not dreaming, but rather of sliding
   into some other dimension. An eerie feeling comes to me from a life
   closer then my own breath, existing somewhere in the space between
   atoms, and yet totally invisible to my conscious eye.

   Such is the realm of seers and shamans, poets and prophets, as well as
   no doubt yourself -- the dream realm is accessible to everyone. As
   internal messages from a universe hidden within, whereby the muse and
   oracle are within your own skull. Long have serendipitous missives
   arisen from our slumber, even while we debate their ultimate origin.
   Social activist Julia Ward Howe wrote "Battle Hymn of the Republic"
   when staying at Washington D.C.'s Ward Hotel in 1861, the "dirtiest,
   dustiest filthiest place I ever saw." While "in a half dreaming state"
   she heard a group of Union soldiers marching down Pennsylvania Avenue
   singing "John Brown's Body," and based on that song Howe composed her
   own hymn while in a reverie. Howe's dreaming was in keeping with a
   melancholic era enraptured to spiritualism and occultism, for she
   commonly was imparted with "attacks of versification [that] had visited
   me in the night." The apocalyptic Civil War altered peoples' dreams, it
   would seem. Jonathan White explores the sleep-world of
   nineteenth-century Americans in his unusual and exhaustive study
   Midnight in America: Darkness, Sleep, and Dreams During the Civil War,
   arguing that peoples' "dream reports were often remarkably raw and
   unfiltered... vividly bringing to life the horrors of the conflict; for
   others, nighttime was an escape from the hard realities of life and
   death in wartime."

   Every era imparts its own images, symbols, and themes into dreams, so
   that collective analysis can tell us about the concerns of any given
   era. White writes that during the Civil War people used dreams to
   relive "distant memories or horrific experiences in battle, longing for
   a return to peace and life as they had known it before the war, kissing
   loved ones that had not seen for years, communing with the dead,
   traveling to faraway places they wished they could see in real life,"
   which even if the particulars may be different, is not so altered from
   our current reposes. One of the most famous of Civil War dreamers was
   Abraham Lincoln, whose own morbid visions were in keeping with
   slumber's prophetic purposes. Only days before his assassination,
   Lincoln recounted to his bodyguard that he'd had an eerily realistic
   dream in which he wandered from room to room in the White House. "I
   heard subdued sobs," Lincoln said, as "if a number of people were
   weeping." The president was disturbed by the sound of mourning, "so
   mysterious and so shocking," until he arrived in the East Room. "Before
   me was a catafalque, on which rested a corpse wrapped in funeral
   vestments," the body inside being that of Lincoln. Such dreams are
   significant -- as the disquieting quarantine visions people have had
   over the past two months can attest to. We should listen -- they have
   something to tell us.

   cover Within literature dreams seem to always have something to say, a
   realm of the fantastic visited in novels as diverse as L. Frank Baum's
   Wizard of Oz, Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol, Neil Gaiman's
   Sandman, and Lewis Carol's Alice in Wonderland. The dream kingdom is a
   place where the laws of physics are muted, where logic and reason no
   longer hold domain, and the wild kings of absurdity are allowed to
   reign triumphant. Those aforementioned novels are ones in which
   characters like Dorothy, Ebenezer Scrooge, Morpheus, and Alice are
   subsumed into a fantastical dream realm, but there are plenty of books
   with more prosaic dream sequences, from Mr. Lockwood's harrowing
   nightmare in Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights to Raskolnikov's violent
   childhood dreams in Fyodor Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment. "I've
   dreamt in my life dreams that have stayed with me ever after, and
   changed my ideas," writes Brontë, "they've gone through and through me,
   like wine through water, and altered the color of my mind." Then there
   is the literature that emerges from dreams, the half-remembered
   snippets and surreal plot lines, the riffs of dialogue and the turns of
   phrase that are birthed from the baked brain of night. Think of the
   poppy reveries of Thomas DeQuincy's Confessions of an English
   Opium-Eater or the delicious purpose of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's
   "Kubla Khan" written in a similar drug haze until the poet was
   interrupted by that damned person from Porlock.

   Spearing writes that "from the time of the Homeric poems down to the
   modern novel, it is surely true that the scene of the great bulk of
   Western literature has not been the internal world of the mind, in
   which dreams transact themselves, but the outer, public world of
   objective reality," but this misses an important point. All novels
   actually occur in the internal world of the mind, no matter how
   vigorous their subjects may be. I'll never be able to see the exact
   same cool colors of Jay Gatsby's shirts that you envision, nor will I
   hear the exact timber of Mr. Darcy's voice that you imagine, in the
   same way that no photographs or drawings or paintings can be brought
   back from the place you go to when you sleep. Dreaming and reading are
   unified in being activities of fully created, totally self-contained
   realities. Furthermore, there is a utopian freedom in this, for that
   closed off dimension, that pinched off universe which you travel to in
   reveries nocturnal or readerly is free of the contagion of the
   corrupted outside world. There are no pop-up ads in dreams, there are
   no telemarketers calling you. Even our nightmares are at least our own.
   Here, as in the novel, the person may be truly free.

   Dreaming is the substance of literature. It's what comes before,
   during, and after writing and reading, and there can be no fiction or
   poetry without it. There is no activity in waking life more similar to
   dreaming than reading (and by proxy writing, which is just
   self-directed reading). All necessitate the complete creation of a
   totally constructed universe constrained within your own head and
   accessible only to the individual. The only difference between reading
   and dreaming is who directs the story. As in a book as in our slumber,
   the world which is entered is one that is singular to the
   dreamer/reader. What you see when you close your eyes is forever
   foreign to me, as I may never enter the exact same story-world that you
   do when you crack open a novel. "Life, what is it but a dream?" Carol
   astutely asks.

   We spend a third of our day in dream realms, which is why philosophers
   and poets have always rightly been preoccupied with them. Dreams
   necessarily make us question that border between waking and sleeping,
   truth and falsity, reality and illusion. That is the substance of
   storytelling as well, and that shared aspect between literature and
   dreaming is just as important as the oddity of existing for a spell in
   entirely closed off, totally self-invented, and completely free worlds.
   What unites the illusions of dreams and our complete ownership of them
   is subjectivity, and that is the charged medium through which
   literature must forever be conducted. Alfred North Whitehead once
   claimed that all of philosophy was mere footnotes to Plato -- accurate
   to say that all of philosophy since then has been variations on the
   theme of kicking the tires of reality and questioning whether this
   exact moment is lived or dreamt.

   The pre-Socratic metaphysician Gorgias was a radical solipsist who
   thought that all the world was the dream of God and the dreamer was
   himself. Plato envisioned our waking life as but a pale shadow of a
   greater world of Forms. Rene Descartes in Meditations on First
   Philosophy forged a methodology of radical doubt, whereby he imagined
   that a malicious demon could potentially deceive him into thinking that
   the "sky, the air, the earth, colors, shapes, sounds and all external
   things are merely the delusions of dreams which he has devised to
   ensnare my judgment. I shall consider myself as not having hands or
   eyes, or flesh, or blood or senses, but as falsely believing that I
   have all these things." So, from the assumption that everything is a
   dream, Descartes tried to latch onto anything that could be certain.
   Other than his own mind, he wasn't able to find much. In dreams there
   is the beginning of metaphysics, for nothing else compels us to
   consider that the world which we see is not the world which there is,
   and yet such philosophical speculation need not philosophers, since
   children engage in it from the moment they can first think.

   When I was a little kid, I misunderstood that old nursery rhyme "Row
   Your Boat." When it queried if "life is but a dream," I took that
   literally to mean that all which we experience is illusion, specter,
   artifice. In my own abstract way I assumed that according to the song,
   all of this which we see: the sun and moon, the trees and flowers, our
   friends and family, are but a dream. And I wondered what it would be
   like when I woke up, who I would recount that marvelous dream too? "I
   had the strangest dream last night," I imagined telling faces unknown
   with names unconveyed. I assumed the song meant that all of this, for
   all of us, was a dream -- and who is to know what that world might look
   like when you wake up? Such a theme is explored in pop culture from the
   cyberpunk dystopia The Matrix to the sitcom finale Newhart, because
   this sense of unreality, of dreams impinging on our not-quite-real
   world is hard to shake. Writing about a classic metaphysical
   thought-experiment known as the Omphalos Argument (from the Greek for
   "navel," as relating to a question of Eden), philosopher Bertrand
   Russell wrote in The Analysis of Mind that "There is no logical
   impossibility... that the world sprang into being five minutes ago,
   exactly as it then was, with a population that `remembered' a wholly
   unreal past." Perhaps we've just dozed off for a few minutes then?
   Here's the thing though -- even if all of this is a dream -- it doesn't
   matter. Because in dreams you're innocent. In dreams you're free.

         Revelation, Nonsense or Dyspepsia: Victorian Dream Theories

   Upon reading a dream episode in a novel by Dickens, or the Brontes, or
   Wilkie Collins, we might pause and ask, What did the Victorians
   consider dreams to be? This simple question leads to others: are
   literary dreams the same as real dreams? should we interpret them as
   such? perhaps even, what do we believe dreams to be? If we distinguish
   real dreams from those in novels--that is, in conventionalized,
   artificial forms--then the interpretation of these literary dreams
   presents certain problems for the cautious critic. We assume a
   character's dreams contain some significance, of course. We can consult
   various psychoanalytic methodologies for interpretive guidelines, and
   these will often produce fascinating readings, yet we may experience a
   certain intellectual dissatisfaction with interpretations which must be
   so alien to what the author and original audience of a text might have
   imagined the dream to have meant. Warnings against the intentional
   fallacy notwithstanding, an author's apprehensions of what dreams are,
   how they may be used in literature, and how readers will respond to
   them clearly matter in the process of composing a dream episode. These
   considerations suggest a cultural and historical approach, rather than
   a psychanalytic one. Perhaps no better test case for this approach
   exists than in the works of Charles Dickens, so let us ask, What did
   Dickens believe dreams to be?

   Dickens composed a vast quantity of literary dreams throughout his
   career. They appear in his earliest writings--Sketches by Boz and The
   Pickwick Papers--and in his last, unfinished novel: The Mystery of
   Edwin Drood. In between, they proliferate in Dickens's novels (for
   example, in David Copperfield, Bleak House, Hard Times and Great
   Expectations), and create the essential structure for shorter prose
   fiction, like A Christmas Carol and The Chimes. Dickens depicts dreams
   and dreaming not only in his manifestly fictional works, but also in
   his ostensibly nonfictional ones: examples include "An Italian Dream"
   in Pictures From Italy, and "Night Walks" in The Uncommercial Traveler.
   Furthermore, he published numerous articles on dreams in his magazines
   Household Words and All the Year Round, and speaks of them in his
   letters.

   This wealth of material has received surprisingly little critical
   attention. Catherine Bernard has one of the most focused discussions of
   Dickens and Victorian theories of dreaming, published in 1981 in the
   collection Victorian Science and Victorian Values. She posits Dickens
   as a proto-Freudian, however, claiming for example that "Dickens
   anticipated Freud's idea of day residues and the distinction between
   latent and manifest content" and further that he "intuitively perceived
   the autobiographical origins of dreams" (205). Ronald R. Thomas
   continues the interweaving of Freud and Dickens in his discussions of
   Great Expectations and A Christmas Carol in Dream s of Authority: Freud
   and the Fictions of the Unconscious (1990).

   Such an approach is understandable. Sigmund Freud's The Interpretation
   of Dreams (published one hundred years ago) revolutionized the
   scientific study of dreams, and provided a framework for the
   interpretation of these phenomena. We are all familiar with Freud's
   model of the unconscious and with his theories of the underlying causes
   of dreams, and so our tendency may be to apply these notions to the
   dreams we find in novels written before 1900 as well as to those
   written after. By doing so we assume that authors such as Dickens
   somehow had a modern understanding of the unconscious and an
   intuitively Freudian notion of dreaming. We also assume that literary
   dreams operate in the same manner as actual dreams (Freud himself
   proposes this approach in "Delusions and Dreams in Jensen's Gradiva").
   These assumptions require careful scrutiny, however, if literary dreams
   are not real dreams (that is,artifacts of the unconscious), but
   consciously created imitations of them. This paper argues that literary
   dreams arise from a historical and cultural context, and reflect not
   just their author's insights into the human mind, but also contemporary
   theories about dreams (from both scientific and popular sources), as
   well as conventional literary representations of dreams and visions. To
   attribute to Dickens a modern understanding of the unconscious or an
   intuitively Freudian notion of dreaming is to wrench him from his
   historical context. To do so is also to ignore the complications of the
   textual evidence, for Dickens's own writings on dreams reveal complex
   assumptions about the causes and meanings of dreams. This complexity
   stems from the conflicting theories of dreaming in the Victorian
   period.

   In order to understand how Dickens used dreams, then, we must return to
   the question: What would he consider dreams to be? Dickens grew up
   under the dual influence of the Romantic movement's fascination with
   states of marginal consciousness, and neuroscience's new theories and
   advances in the study of the brain. The change in long accepted
   paradigms of the structure of the nervous system, and the
   well-publicized and revolutionary work in organology and phrenology of
   Franz Joseph Gall and Caspar Spurzheim, "all helped to focus the
   attention of the layman as well as the scientist on the nervous system
   and, in particular, on the brain" (Clarke and Jacyna 5). Roger Cooter
   notes, "Gall's doctrine beckoned into its orbit every one of the
   social, psychological, intellectual, political and religious concerns
   that had been aggravated and heightened by the conditions of rapid and
   pervasive social and economic change" (6). The operation of the
   sleeping mind became an important focal point for supporters and
   opponents of Gall, and this attention encouraged widespread speculation
   on the mysterious nature and meaning of dreams.

   That speculation manifested itself in two broad paradigms: the
   scientific and the spiritual. Perhaps the next step to answering our
   initial question, then, is to ask, "What would Dickens have been
   reading about dreams?" Scientific studies, or at least studies which
   assumed the prestige and authority (if not the pure methods) of
   science, proliferated in the early nineteenth century. But these
   studies coexisted in the book stalls and the magazines with works of
   oneirocriticism (or dream interpretation guides) and spiritual accounts
   of revelatory dreams.

   The foundation for most scientific studies of mental activity was
   associationism, which David Hartley popularized in his Observations on
   Man (1749). Hartley deduces three causes for dreams: the residue of
   daily impressions, the physical state of the dreamer's stomach and
   brain, and, most importantly, the associations of thoughts and images
   which always go on in the mind, but which are more vivid and less
   controlled during sleep. Most later scientific studies accept Hartley's
   associationist paradigm; a partial list of those published during
   Dicken's life includes William Newnham's Essays on Superstition (1830);
   John Abercrombie's Inquiries Concerning the Intellectual Powers and the
   Investigation of Truth (1831); Walter C. Dendy's On the Phenomena of
   Dreams and Other Transient Illusions (1832); Robert Macnish's The
   Philosophy of Sleep (1834); Alexander Grant's The Literature and
   Curiosities of Dreams (1865); and William Hammond's Sleep and Its
   Derangements (1869). Although these works differ in terminology and
   emphasis, their similarities are striking. The authors, all physicians
   or surgeons, employ little scientific rigor to support their claims.
   More frequently, they rely on second-hand anecdotal evidence, classical
   sources (usually Pliny, Plutarch and Suetonius) or literature (often
   Sir Walter Scott's The Antiquary). We can follow the trail of one
   anecdote as a typical example: to illustrate how sensory impressions
   shape our dreams, Abercrombie describes how his friend, James Gregory,
   gave him a manuscript by his father, Dr. Gregory, which relates that
   the doctor had gone to bed with a hot water bottle at his feet, and had
   dreamed he was walking on Mt. Aetna (260). Abercrombie makes no
   apparent effort to check this story's veracity or to duplicate it.
   Macnish repeats the anecdote of Dr. Gregory's dream, and thirty-seven
   years later, Hammond continues its use in this fairly effaced form:
   "Instances are given of persons sleeping with bottles of hot water
   applied to their feet dreaming of walking on burning lava, or some
   other hot substance" (133). A scientific methodology to study whether
   the same stimulus will produce similar dreams did not appear until
   Alfred Maury's Le Sommeil et le Reves (1865), which pioneered the role
   of stimulation and suggestion in shaping dreams.

   Certain general assumptions about dreams recur in these scientific
   studies. One often repeated point is that dreams only occur in
   imperfect sleep. Newnham states, "There are no dreams in natural
   sleep--that is, in sound and quiet sleep--the body being healthy, and
   the mind at ease." Dreams occur only in a "morbid" state, when the
   brain is disordered by certain irritants, such as strong emotions,
   prolonged study, approaching sickness, dyspepsia or other states which
   impair sleeping (163). Macnish employs a phrenological model, stating
   that in "perfect sleep" all the brain's organs are at rest; but if one
   or more of the organs remain awake while the others sleep, dreaming
   results (43). The rationale seems to be that dreaming has to occur in
   an aberrant state of mind, because of the irrational nature of dreams.
   Another general feature of these studies is the analogy between
   dreaming and insanity. Abercrombie compares how in both dreaming and
   madness the mind acts without volition, and follows whatever "chain of
   thought" or associated images are present at the moment (256). Macnish
   calls a dream a "transient delirium," which resembles insanity in the
   absence of the mental faculty of judgement (45). All the studies assert
   that dreams originate in both previous mental associations and existing
   sensory impressions. Macnish speaks at greater length than the others
   on the effect of diet on the content of dreams. He contends that "a
   disordered state of the stomach and liver will often produce dreams,"
   and that as a general rule dyspepsia produces bad dreams (53). A final
   and crucial point of agreement in these various scientific studies is
   their denial of prophetic powers in dreams. Dendy states that although
   the notion of revelatory dreams is "entertained generally," we no
   longer live in "days of special inspiration"; therefore, he cannot
   rationally accept "the visions of slumbers as revelations or
   prognostics" (70). Macnish advances the same argument, and comments
   that the idea "is so singularly unphilosophical, that I would not have
   noticed it, were it not advocated even by persons of good sense and
   education" (102). This last remark is important, for it indicates that
   the scientific view of dreams had strong competition for popular
   acceptance.

   We find that competition in dream books and spiritual accounts of
   revelatory dreams. Dream books, inexpensive handbooks for the most
   general and least educated audiences, contain encyclopedic lists of
   objects or actions, and provide instructions on how to interpret any of
   them if they appear in the reader's dreams. These books invariably
   claim that an understanding of dreams will help the reader prosper, or
   will warn of coming trouble. Stemming in principle from the
   second-century dream book the Oneirocriticon (or The Interpretation of
   Dreams) of Artemidorus (first translated into English in 1643),
   nineteenth-century dream books are often anonymous works plagiarized
   heavily from previous dream books, sometimes only altering the title
   page in hopes of attracting new buyers. One such work I have examined
   is the anonymous, undated Nocturnal Revels: or, Universal Interpreter
   of Dreams and Visions. This text presents "the Nature, Causes, and Uses
   of various kinds of Dreams and Representations," and lists various
   objects and actions in dreams, with their meanings. Another widely read
   type of dream book, more spiritual and less pragmatic, catalogues
   narratives of revelatory dreams and other mysterious phenomena. Some of
   these works insist on a divine or supernatural origin for this
   capacity, while others claim it is a natural human power. For example,
   Mrs. Blair's Dreams and Dreaming (1843) contains narratives of
   premonitory dreams drawn from the Bible and contemporary accounts, and
   the author treats these dreams as divine revelations that God offers as
   moral directives. She asks, "Does it not savour of infidelity to say,
   that the Divine Being has neither the will nor the ability to instruct
   his creatures asleep as well as awake?" (114). Similarly, an anonymous
   article in the Baptist Magazine in 1828 asserts, "Insignificant as
   dreams in general are, there are doubtless two classes of agents that
   have access to our minds when sleep has impaired our own agency"--those
   classes are good angels (or "ministering spirits") and evil angels (who
   tempt the weak to wickedness) (qtd. in Grant 160-62). In contrast to
   such religious theories are those who assert a natural origin. Thomas
   De Quincey speaks in Suspiria de Profundis (1845) of "the machinery for
   dreaming planted in the human brain" as "a dreaming organ" analogous to
   other sensory organs (88), and "the one great tube through which man
   communicates with the shadowy" (88). Catherine Crowe's The Night Side
   of Nature (1850), provides many anecdotal examples of presentiments and
   prophetic dreams, and explains that "The soul, which is designed as the
   mirror of a superior spiritual order (to which it belongs), still
   receives, in dreams, some rays from above, and enjoys a foretaste of
   its future condition" (47). Yet Crowe asserts that "the faculty of
   presentiment [is] a natural one, though only imperfectly and
   capriciously developed" (47). Some few studies tried to link the
   spiritual and scientific theories. Joseph Haven, in Mental Philosophy:
   including the Intellect, Sensibilities, and Will (1857), tenatively
   asserts, "A dream may be prophetic, yet not supernatural. Some law, not
   fully known to us, may exist, by virtue of which the nervous system,
   when in a highly excited state, becomes susceptible of impressions not
   ordinarily received ... so as to become strangely cognizant of the
   coming future. Can anyone show that this is impossible? Is it more
   improbable than that the cases recorded are mere chance coincidences?"
   (qtd. in Grant 165).

   This survey of the competing discussions of dreams suggests the real
   diversity of theories and explanations which coexisted. The two broad
   streams of scientific and spiritual dream theories, each with
   subcurrents of disputes over method or essence, run parallel and in
   continual debate throughout the nineteenth century. These debates
   mirror Victorian cultural tensions and uncertainties; dreams become a
   focus for discussions of the nature of the mind and the soul, matter
   and spirit, science and religion. Most Victorians, immersed in this
   debate, aware of both channels of thought, considered dreams to be
   meaningless and meaningful, mere physiological artifacts and messages
   from the great beyond.

   Dickens was not only aware of but also keenly interested in this topic.
   George Henry Lewes reports that dreams were "a subject which always
   interested him, and on which he had stored many striking anecdotes"
   (72). Dickens owned several of the major studies of dreams, including
   ones by Macnish and Abercrombie (Bernard 202). Determining Dickens's
   actual view of dreams, however, is problematic, because his comments in
   letters and essays often appear at odds with his practice in the
   novels. Selecting representative examples from his letters, essays and
   novels, we can better see the diversity of his views.

   Outside of his fiction, Dickens tends on the whole to favor the
   scientific view over the supernatural. He parodies popular dreambooks
   in the essay "Dictionary Dreams," published in All the Year Round (31
   August, 1861), which sarcastically refutes the accuracy of The Ladies'
   Own Dreambook and ridicules popular oneirocriticism (549-552). For
   instance, the narrator of the essay reads that "To dream of cucumbers
   denotes recovery to the sick, and you will fall speedily in love; . . .
   also moderate success in trade." The narrator, a believer in modern
   associationist theories, sarcastically conjectures whether it would not
   be possible to cultivate such an auspicious dream by contemplating and
   then devouring an enormous cucumber before bedtime (551).

   Dickens also tends to explore the workings of the sleeping mind as
   Macnish and Abercrombie do, emphasizing the chaotic whirl of thoughts
   freed from the control of waking reason. In "Early Coaches," which
   appears in Sketches by Boz (1836), he depicts the fitful sleep of a man
   awaiting a predawn call to wake him for a business trip. In this
   passage he exhibits a classic scientific paradigm of dreams-caused by
   imperfect sleep, shaped by associated thoughts and external auditory
   sensations, and perceived half-incredulously by the half-conscious
   mind:
   You left strict orders, overnight, to be called at half-past four, and
   you have done nothing all night but doze for five minutes at a time,
   and start up suddenly from a terrific dream of a large church-clock
   with the small hand running round, with astonishing rapidity, to every
   figure on the dial-plate. At last, completely exhausted, you fall
   gradually into a refreshing sleep--your thoughts grow confused--the
   stage-coaches, which have been 'going off' before your eyes all night,
   become less and less distinct, until they go off altogether; one moment
   you are driving with all the skill and smartness of an experienced
   whip--the next...you are closely muffled up, inside, and have just
   recognised in the person of the guard an old schoolfellow, whose
   funeral, even in your dream, you remember to have attended eighteen
   years ago. At last you fall into a state of complete oblivion, from
   which you are aroused, as if into a new state of existence, by a
   singular illusion. You are apprenticed to a trunk-maker; how, or why,
   or when, or wherefore, you don't take the trouble to inquire; but there
   you are, pasting the lining in the lid of a portmanteau. Confound that
   other apprentice in the back shop, how he is hammering!--rap, rap,
   rap-- what an industrious fellow he must be! you have heard him at work
   for half an hour past, and he has been hammering incessantly the whole
   time. Rap, rap, rap, again--he's talking now--what's that he said? Five
   o'clock! You make a violent exertion, and start up in bed.
   This passage seems well informed by scientific studies: the dreams
   occur only before and after the period of sound sleep (or "oblivion"),
   not during it; the perception of time is warped during the dream, so
   that a brief moment of dreaming seems to contain an immense span of
   time; and the mind creates a dream to explain the sounds perceived
   during sleep. The second-person narration of this dream emphasizes its
   familiarity; this is the sort of dream, Dickens suggests, that anyone
   would have under these conditions-even the reader.

   Dickens interpreted his own dreams from this scientific standpoint as
   well. In a letter to John Forster in September of 1844, he describes a
   vivid dream he had while in Italy with his family: the spirit of Mary
   Hogarth appears to him, veiled in blue like the Madonna but
   nevertheless recognizable. He pleads for a sign that the visit is real,
   asking for the comfort of her mother, and also for the answer to the
   question, "What is the True religion?" Dickens relates,
   As it paused without replying, I said--Good God, in such an agony of
   haste, lest it should go away!-- 'You think, as I do, that the Form of
   religion does not so greatly matter, if we try to do good?--or,' I
   said, observing that it still hesitated, and was moved with the
   greatest compassion for me, 'perhaps the Roman Catholic is the
   best?'....'For you,' said the Spirit, full of such heavenly tenderness
   for me, that I felt as if my heart would break; 'for you, it is the
   best!' Then I awoke, with the tears running down my face. (4.196)

   This experience would seem to epitomize a revelatory vision: the spirit
   of a woman he idolized comes to him from the other world and answers
   one of the profound questions of his life. Yet rather than musing on
   any serious significance in the dream (or converting to Catholicism),
   Dickens instead explains it away. He speculates on "the fragments of
   reality...which helped to make it up," including a painful recurrence
   of rheumatism which upset his sleep, the near drowning of his son Fred
   the week before which directed his thoughts toward death, the presence
   in the room of an altar with a missing religious picture (which had
   caused Dickens to wonder what the face in the picture had looked like),
   and the nearby convent bells which had supplied the "thought, no doubt,
   of Roman Catholic services" (4.196). This letter suggests Dickens was
   not only familiar with the standard scientific explanations of dreams,
   but tended to accept them and apply them to his own dreams.

   Dreams were a recurring topic in his magazines, suggesting that the
   topic interested a general audience. Dickens' published the essays
   "Dreams" in Household Words (8 March 1851), and "A Physician's Dreams,"
   in two parts in All the Year Round (26 November and 3 December 1859).
   Both tend to reflect the accepted scientific explanations of the
   causes, types and meaning of dreams. The Household Words essayis more
   interesting because it provided Dickens with an opportunity to discuss
   his observations on the topic. In a letter he instructed Dr. Thomas
   Stone, the author, to revise the article, stating, "If I venture to say
   I think it may be made a little more original, and a little less
   recapitulative of the usual stories in the books, it is because I have
   read something on the subject, and have long observed it with the
   greatest attention and interest" (Letters 6:276). Dickens's views,
   while informed by scientific explanations and literary conventions of
   dreams, accept neither fully. In contrast to most scientific views of
   the day, Dickens opposes the idea that a residue of the day's events
   chiefly makes up our nightly dreams: "I would suggest that the
   influence of the day's occurrences, and of recent events, is by no
   means so great (generally speaking) as is usually supposed....When
   dreams can be directly traced to any incidents of recent occurrence, it
   appears to me that the incidents are usually of the most insignificant
   character-such as made no impression, of which we were conscious, at
   the time" (6.276-277). His own dreams, he states, are more often scenes
   from his youth, and he marvels that although he had been married
   fourteen years and had nine children, he never dreamed of them. He
   argues that his experience is more common than not, based on many
   conversations on the subject. He also asserts that there is "a
   remarkable sameness" in our dreams, which are not, as Stone supposed,
   "very various and different" (6.278). He adds,
   how many dreams are common to us all, from the Queen to the
   Costermonger! We all fall off that Tower-we all skim above the ground
   at a great pace and can't keep on it--...we all take unheard-of trouble
   to go to the Theatre and never get in--or to go to a Feast, which can't
   be eaten or drunk-or to read letters, or placards, or books, that no
   study will render legible--or to break some Thraldom or other, from
   which we can't escape--or we all confound the living with the dead, and
   all frequently have a knowledge or suspicion that we are doing it--we
   all astonish ourselves by telling ourselves, in a dialogue with
   ourselves, the most astonishing and terrific secrets--we all go to
   public places in our night dresses, and are horribly disconcerted, lest
   the company should discern it. (6.278-279)
   Stone's article makes use of Dickens' suggestions-even to the extent of
   paraphrasing and quoting his examples.

   Besides establishing Dickens' fascination with and expertise in the
   study of dreams, the letter also provides two interesting statements
   about his theory of dreams in literature. One suggests that dreams can
   contain a hidden but discernible meaning: "I should say the chances
   were a thousand to one against anybody's dreaming of the subject
   closely occupying the waking mind--except--and this I wish particularly
   to suggest to you--in a sort of allegorical manner" (276). He also
   discusses the use of dreams as a plot device: "The obvious convenience
   and effect of making the dreams of heroes and heroines bear on the
   great themes of a story as illustrated by their late experiences, seem
   to me to have led the Poets away from the truth, on this head-and to
   have established the conventional beliefs from which I differ" (277).
   He may have discounted the conventions, but he also found them too
   convenient and effective not to use in his own novels.

   There is a tension between what Dickens in his letters asserts real
   dreams are, and what he creates in his fiction to represent a dream.
   That tension between scientific and supernatural poles varies in
   different episodes from different novels. We might plot a line, with
   the fever dreams which arise as recognizable medical symptoms in Bleak
   House and Great Expectations on one end, and the overtly supernatural
   dream visions in A Christmas Carol and The Chimes on the other; in
   between we might place revelatory dreams which exist in a more or less
   psychologically believable milieu: Montague Tigg's nightmare in Martin
   Chuzzlewit, or Stephen Blackpool's vision in Hard Times. Such an
   organizing principle helps to suggest the variety of Dickens' literary
   dreams. Despite the useful metaphor of a line between two opposite
   points, though, even the scientifically explicable fever dreams contain
   true revelations, and even the supernatural visions are accompanied by
   rational dismissals within the text. Both paradigms coexist in the
   dream episode. Dickens takes pains to construct around his dream
   episodes a rational frame which explains it away as originating within
   the dreamer. In Martin Chuzzlewit, for instance, Montague Tigg has a
   nightmare of a door that he cannot keep closed, and of a dangerous man
   named J. His dream may be a result of his waking thoughts and restless
   mind (Tigg worries about the door in his room he cannot lock, and "his
   fears or evil conscience reproduced this door in all his dreams"
   (651)), or imperfect slumber (Tigg sleeps in a strange bed, during a
   thunderstorm), or dim awareness of external sensations (Tigg wakes to
   find Jonas Chuzzlewit "standing at his bedside watching him. And that
   very door wide open" (651)). Other common explanations are incipient
   illness (Esther Summerson's smallpox) or indigestion (as Scrooge
   exclaims to Marley's ghost, "You may be an undigested bit of beef, a
   blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato.
   There's more of gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are!"(12)).
   The dream itself, however, follows the (conventionally literary)
   tradition that dreams are true revelations. Tigg's own ghost appears in
   the dream as "a man with a bloody smear upon his head" to reveal his
   fate: Jonas will kill him with a blow to the head five chapters later.

   The tension between a suspicion of and a faith in the revelatory power
   of dreams is, of course, quite ancient, but the ambivalence continues
   throughout the nineteenth century and directly shapes Dickens's
   discussion of and attitude toward dreams. Further exploration of how
   popular theories of dreams--which exist on the smudged boundaries of
   science, religion and folklore-influenced Dickens's creation of
   literary dreams would form an important contribution to the study of
   his works. In her essay "Against Tradition: The Case for a
   Particularized Historical Method," Marilyn Butler emphasizes that, "A
   genuinely historical perspective discourages dogmatism, by obliging us
   to foreground the differences between our circumstances, aims, and
   language, and those of the past" (44). Only by recognizing those
   differences, and the original contexts which produced Dickens's novels,
   can we hope to understand the meaning of the literary dreams, rather
   than project meaning upon them.

   What, to the Writer, <br>Are Dreams?

What, to the Writer,
Are Dreams?

Lauren Acampora on the Mythic Links Between
Dream Life and Creativity

   via Grove
   Lauren Acampora June 11, 2019

   "Dream is the personalized myth, myth the depersonalized dream."
   -Joseph Campbell
   Article continues after advertisement

   One morning, when I was younger, I gave a detailed description of my
   previous night's dream to my mother. When I finished, she said, "I'm
   going to tell you something. Don't ever share your dreams with anyone
   except your spouse. It's boring to listen to other people's dreams."

   I was offended at first. How could anyone, not to mention my own
   mother, fail to find my dreams as fascinating as I did? But of course
   she was right; it's almost always deadly to hear other people talk
   about their dreams. As a rule, dreams die in the glare of the waking
   world, their shimmering aura evaporating in the harsh air outside the
   psyche. And yet, paradoxically, it's the emotional aura of dreams that
   makes them feel so urgently worth sharing in the first place.

   Needless to say, I didn't listen to my mother. That is, I still share
   my dreams promiscuously--just not verbally.

   Like so many other writers and artists, I employ dreams in my creative
   work. They're an engine, a lending library. It's a thrill to awake with
   a strange, arresting image in mind, or still grasping the thread of an
   allegorical dream story. Sometimes, a vision or scenario arrives as a
   package deal: the story is encased within the vision, packed up tight
   with a certain mood. For me, entire short stories have sprung from such
   vision: a woman alone in a pool, a finger touching a brain, a
   blindfolded child. A haunting dream of orange curtains in a hotel room
   has rolled into an entire novel (in which orange hotel curtains do not
   ever appear). And the power and mystery of dreams themselves inspired
   my novel The Paper Wasp, in which the narrator illustrates--and
   ultimately enters--her vivid, seemingly premonitory dreams.
   Article continues after advertisement

   There's no shortage of literature and art that we know to have sprung
   from dreams. As legend has it, the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge
   transcribed the first lines of "Kubla Khan" from a dream; the idea for
   Frankenstein came to Mary Shelley in her sleep; Robert Louis Stevenson
   conceived of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in a consumptive fever dream;
   Stephen King came up with the idea for Misery while napping on a plane;
   William Styron had a dream that inspired Sophie's Choice. One of the
   most prolific dream miners of all was Edgar Allen Poe, who used his
   frequent nightmares in much of his work. And famously, Paul McCartney
   dreamed the tune for the song "Yesterday." Upon waking, he asked his
   friends if they knew it. "It's a good little tune," he said, "but I
   couldn't have written it because I dreamt it."

   Dreams can feel like messages from another place, so it's no surprise
   that many ancient cultures believed dreams to be transmissions of
   divine knowledge. The Ancient Egyptians considered dreams to be
   oracular and held vivid dreamers in high regard. They practiced dream
   incubation and lucid dreaming, and employed dream guides called the
   "Masters of Secret Things" who lived in dream temples. The Greeks, too,
   incubated dreams, and thought that gods came to dreamers through a
   keyhole to deliver messages. The Aboriginal Australians and the
   Iroquois started their day by sharing dreams, which were considered a
   source of guidance for both the individual and the community. The Hindu
   religion, too, believes that in dreams one is given a glimpse of
   Vishnu, whose own dreaming mind creates our reality. It isn't difficult
   to understand where such beliefs come from if you've ever dreamed of
   reading a book, sentence after lucid, elaborate sentence. "I couldn't
   have written it," you might think, "because I dreamt it."

   It's difficult, even paradoxical, to try to bear total witness to
   dreams, akin to pinning down the present moment, halting the slippage
   of time.

   Brain science validates this phenomenon. Dreaming occurs during REM
   sleep, when the frontal lobe, the executive area of the brain, is shut
   down. Dreams are the mysterious activity of another part of the brain,
   beneath the scrutiny of the frontal lobe. Neurologically speaking, we
   really are receiving transmissions from a foreign entity; the
   unconscious, unobserved self slips through the keyhole when the guard
   is off duty.

   Even during waking hours, the human brain is divided: the
   executive-desk frontal lobe and the inscrutable, intuitive limbic
   system are strangers to each other. In sleep, they are incommunicado.
   Because of this deep rift, the great majority of our dreams go
   unremembered, except on a buried emotional level. It's difficult, even
   paradoxical, to try to bear total witness to them, akin to pinning down
   the present moment, halting the slippage of time. Just as the present
   can only be considered in retrospect, the unconscious mind can only be
   discerned via the remembered scraps of dreams. Any glimmers of
   awareness that may come during sleep, when a dream is fleetingly
   apprehended, are instances of the conscious half of the brain briefly
   observing and translating the activity of the submerged half:
   interpreting the enigmatic message of a stranger. These glimmers are
   rare and fleeting, occurring only during the hypnogogic and hypnopompic
   states, the liminal states between wakefulness and sleep.

   In siphoning dreams for their work, writers and artists are tapping a
   valuable well. Dream logic and imagery carries an uncanny, allegorical
   quality that resonates deeply with readers and audiences. And it's
   possible that dream recall actually enhances artistic output during
   waking hours. Scientific studies have confirmed a correlation between
   dream recall and creativity; those who recall dreams actually perform
   better on creativity evaluations. This may be because creative people
   are naturally better at recalling their dreams. It's a chicken or egg
   situation: do creative people have more vivid and memorable dreams
   because they are innately creative, or can a brain become more creative
   through strengthening dream recall? Whatever the case, making use of
   dreams in art is a powerful way to reflect our foreign selves back to
   ourselves, while projecting that mystery self out to the world as
   archetypal image and story--dream as personalized myth, myth as
   depersonalized dream.

   For writers, plugging into the unconscious provides a direct line to
   the human imagination in all its splendor and darkness. Indeed, in the
   midst of composing, it's often unclear where the words are coming from.
   Sentences and imagery sometimes bubble up from a hidden well that
   surprises the conscious, transcribing mind. Some writers will tell you
   that they write in order to exorcise their demons, cleanse their
   psyches, to bring their fears and darkness into the light. Some will
   tell you that it's better than therapy.

   Writing at full tilt can be a euphoric state, tantamount to lucid
   dreaming. It's half-awareness--one foot in, one foot out--a balance on
   the brink of consciousness. It's not just in dreams that we can
   experience the ecstasy of flight and the exhilaration of omnipotence,
   but also when writing, when the words are flowing, the images
   appearing. Just as in a lucid dream, this exhilaration is paired with
   the knowledge that it can't last, that it's a temporary spell. Soon,
   we'll become too aware of flying, and the spell will break and drop us
   to the ground. Still, we endeavor to capture and recapture this ecstasy
   of creative freedom, the ability to travel lightly anywhere at will,
   the bliss of floating to the treetops.

   If writing fiction is analogous to dreaming, the experience of reading
   fiction can be, too. When we're reading, another person is able to
   intrude into our psyches through the use of words alone, remotely
   projecting imagery onto the screens of our minds, suffusing them with
   atmosphere and mood. We are, in a way, sharing a dream with a stranger.
   And fiction, at its best, places a mirror before us, evoking terror and
   wonder. It affects us on an emotional level beyond language, and brings
   a frisson of recognition. There's a momentary astonishment to encounter
   the familiar within the strange, something of our own inner lives on
   the page. There's the eerie sense that the author has somehow entered
   and seen into us. The best art carries this sense of inevitability, of
   allegory, myth, dream--a truth that has always been there, that we
   already know in some deep part of ourselves.

   This flare of astonishment is arguably the purpose of art. It's the
   sudden thinning of the distance between us, the erosion of barriers
   that have been built and propped up by our conscious, waking lives.
   Like a flash of lightning, great art illuminates the human landscape in
   its breathtaking entirety and shows that the barriers are flimsy,
   false, only temporarily there. All at once, we are taken outside
   ourselves and given a glimpse of the Jungian collective unconscious,
   the subliminal wholeness of life, the enveloping dream of Vishnu. What
   is the purpose of all art, if not to puncture the illusion of
   fragmentation, to reveal the commonality of human experience, to return
   us--if briefly--to those collective waters?

   Phenomenon of the mind while sleeping
   For other uses, see Dream (disambiguation) and Dreams (disambiguation).

   [500px-A_dream_%28BM_1868%2C0808.9057%29.jpg] In this illustration,
   politician Daniel O'Connell dreams of a confrontation between his
   outfit and that of George IV (r. 1820-1830; shown via a thought bubble)

   A dream is a succession of images, dynamic scenes and situations,
   ideas, emotions, and sensations that usually occur involuntarily in the
   mind during certain stages of sleep.^[1] Humans spend more than two
   hours dreaming per night,^[2] and each dream lasts around 5-20
   minutes.^[3]

   The content and function of dreams have been topics of scientific,
   philosophical and religious interest throughout recorded history. Dream
   interpretation, practiced by the Babylonians in the third millennium
   BCE^[4] and even earlier by the ancient Sumerians,^[5]^[6] figures
   prominently in religious texts in several traditions, and has played a
   lead role in psychotherapy.^[7]^[8] Dreamwork is similar, but does not
   seek to conclude with definite meaning. The scientific study of dreams
   is called oneirology.^[9] Most modern dream study focuses on the
   neurophysiology of dreams and on proposing and testing hypotheses
   regarding dream function. It is not known where in the brain dreams
   originate, if there is a single origin for dreams or if multiple
   regions of the brain are involved, or what the purpose of dreaming is
   for the body (or brain or mind).

   The human dream experience and what to make of it has undergone sizable
   shifts over the course of history.^[10]^[11] Long ago, according to
   writings from Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt, dreams dictated post-dream
   behaviors to an extent that was sharply reduced in later
   millennia.^[clarification needed] These ancient writings about dreams
   highlight visitation dreams, where a dream figure, usually a deity or a
   prominent forebear, commands the dreamer to take specific actions, and
   which may predict future events.^[12]^[13]^[14] Framing the dream
   experience varies across cultures as well as through time.

   Dreaming and sleep are intertwined. Dreams occur mainly in the
   rapid-eye movement (REM) stage of sleep--when brain activity is high
   and resembles that of being awake. Because REM sleep is detectable in
   many species, and because research suggests that all mammals experience
   REM,^[15] linking dreams to REM sleep has led to conjectures that
   animals dream. However, humans dream during non-REM sleep, also, and
   not all REM awakenings elicit dream reports.^[16] To be studied, a
   dream must first be reduced to a verbal report, which is an account of
   the subject's memory of the dream, not the subject's dream experience
   itself. Therefore, dreaming by non-humans is currently unprovable, as
   is dreaming by human fetuses and pre-verbal infants.^[17]

Etymology

   In Old English, the word dream was used to describe "noise", "joy", or
   "music", but not related to the sleep-induced brain activity. It was
   only in the 13th century that the word dream was used to describe "a
   series of thoughts, images or emotions occurring during sleep".
   Etymologists believe that this change was influenced due to the Old
   Norse draumr, which had the same meaning as the word dream
   nowadays.^[18]

   Preserved writings from early Mediterranean civilizations indicate a
   relatively abrupt change in subjective dream experience between Bronze
   Age antiquity and the beginnings of the classical era.^[19]

   In visitation dreams reported in ancient writings, dreamers were
   largely passive in their dreams, and visual content served primarily to
   frame authoritative auditory messaging.^[20]^[10]^[21] Gudea, the king
   of the Sumerian city-state of Lagash (reigned c. 2144-2124 BCE),
   rebuilt the temple of Ningirsu as the result of a dream in which he was
   told to do so.^[6] After antiquity, the passive hearing of visitation
   dreams essentially gave way to visualized narratives in which the
   dreamer becomes a character who actively participates.

   From the 1940s to 1985, Calvin S. Hall collected more than 50,000 dream
   reports at Western Reserve University. In 1966, Hall and Robert Van de
   Castle published The Content Analysis of Dreams, outlining a coding
   system to study 1,000 dream reports from college students.^[22] Results
   indicated that participants from varying parts of the world
   demonstrated similarity in their dream content. The only residue of
   antiquity's authoritative dream figure in the Hall and Van de Castle
   listing of dream characters is the inclusion of God in the category of
   prominent persons.^[23] Hall's complete dream reports were made
   publicly available in the mid-1990s by his protégé William Domhoff.
   More recent studies of dream reports, while providing more detail,
   continue to cite the Hall study favorably.^[24]

   In the Hall study, the most common emotion experienced in dreams was
   anxiety. Other emotions included abandonment, anger, fear, joy, and
   happiness. Negative emotions were much more common than positive
   ones.^[22] The Hall data analysis showed that sexual dreams occur no
   more than 10% of the time and are more prevalent in young to
   mid-teens.^[22] Another study showed that 8% of both men's and women's
   dreams have sexual content.^[25] In some cases, sexual dreams may
   result in orgasms or nocturnal emissions. These are colloquially known
   as "wet dreams".^[26]

   The visual nature of dreams is generally highly phantasmagoric; that
   is, different locations and objects continuously blend into each other.
   The visuals (including locations, people, and objects) are generally
   reflective of a person's memories and experiences, but conversation can
   take on highly exaggerated and bizarre forms. Some dreams may even tell
   elaborate stories wherein the dreamer enters entirely new, complex
   worlds and awakes with ideas, thoughts, and feelings never experienced
   before the dream.

   People who are blind from birth do not have visual dreams. Their dream
   contents are related to other senses, such as hearing, touch, smell,
   and taste, whichever are present since birth.^[27]

Effects of regional or global catastrophes

   The COVID-19 pandemic also influenced the content of people's dreams,
   according to a scientific study of over 15,000 dream reports by Deirdre
   Barrett. This analysis revealed that themes involving fear, illness,
   and death were two to four times more prevalent in dreams following the
   onset of the pandemic than they were before.^[28]

Neurophysiology

   Main article: Cognitive neuroscience of dreams
   Further information: Neuroscience of sleep

   Dream study is popular with scientists exploring the mind-brain
   problem. Some "propose to reduce aspects of dream phenomenology to
   neurobiology."^[29] But current science cannot specify dream physiology
   in detail. Protocols in most nations restrict human brain research to
   non-invasive procedures. In the United States, invasive brain
   procedures with a human subject are allowed only when these are deemed
   necessary in surgical treatment to address medical needs of the same
   human subject.^[30] Non-invasive measures of brain activity like
   electroencephalogram (EEG) voltage averaging or cerebral blood flow
   cannot identify small but influential neuronal populations.^[31] Also,
   fMRI signals are too slow to explain how brains compute in real
   time.^[32]

   Scientists researching some brain functions can work around current
   restrictions by examining animal subjects. As stated by the Society for
   Neuroscience, "Because no adequate alternatives exist, much of this
   research must [sic] be done on animal subjects."^[33] However, since
   animal dreaming can be only inferred, not confirmed, animal studies
   yield no hard facts to illuminate the neurophysiology of dreams.
   Examining human subjects with brain lesions can provide clues, but the
   lesion method cannot discriminate between the effects of destruction
   and disconnection and cannot target specific neuronal groups in
   heterogeneous regions like the brain stem.^[31]

   Denied precision tools and obliged to depend on imaging, much dream
   research has succumbed to the law of the instrument. Studies detect an
   increase of blood flow in a specific brain region and then credit that
   region with a role in generating dreams. But pooling study results has
   led to the newer conclusion that dreaming involves large numbers of
   regions and pathways, which likely are different for different dream
   events.^[34]

   Image creation in the brain involves significant neural activity
   downstream from eye intake, and it is theorized that "the visual
   imagery of dreams is produced by activation during sleep of the same
   structures that generate complex visual imagery in waking
   perception."^[35]

   Dreams present a running narrative rather than exclusively visual
   imagery. Following their work with split-brain subjects, Gazzaniga and
   LeDoux postulated, without attempting to specify the neural mechanisms,
   a "left-brain interpreter" that seeks to create a plausible narrative
   from whatever electro-chemical signals reach the brain's left
   hemisphere. Sleep research has determined that some brain regions fully
   active during waking are, during REM sleep, activated only in a partial
   or fragmentary way.^[36] Drawing on this knowledge, textbook author
   James W. Kalat explains, "[A] dream represents the brain's effort to
   make sense of sparse and distorted information.... The cortex combines
   this haphazard input with whatever other activity was already occurring
   and does its best to synthesize a story that makes sense of the
   information."^[37] Neuroscientist Indre Viskontas is even more blunt,
   calling often bizarre dream content "just the result of your
   interpreter trying to create a story out of random neural
   signaling."^[38]

Theories on function

   Main article: Oneirology
   Further information: Rapid eye movement sleep

   For many humans across multiple eras and cultures, dreams are believed
   to have functioned as revealers of truths sourced during sleep from
   gods or other external entities.^[39] Ancient Egyptians believed that
   dreams were the best way to receive divine revelation, and thus they
   would induce (or "incubate") dreams. They went to sanctuaries and slept
   on special "dream beds" in hope of receiving advice, comfort, or
   healing from the gods.^[14] From a Darwinian perspective dreams would
   have to fulfill some kind of biological requirement, provide some
   benefit for natural selection to take place, or at least have no
   negative impact on fitness. Robert (1886),^[40] a physician from
   Hamburg, was the first who suggested that dreams are a need and that
   they have the function to erase (a) sensory impressions that were not
   fully worked up, and (b) ideas that were not fully developed during the
   day. In dreams, incomplete material is either removed (suppressed) or
   deepened and included into memory. Freud, whose dream studies focused
   on interpreting dreams, not explaining how or why humans dream,
   disputed Robert's hypothesis^[41] and proposed that dreams preserve
   sleep by representing as fulfilled those wishes that otherwise would
   awaken the dreamer.^[42] Freud wrote that dreams "serve the purpose of
   prolonging sleep instead of waking up. Dreams are the GUARDIANS of
   sleep and not its disturbers."^[43]

   Granddaughter Dream (1839 or 1840). Taras Shevchenko

   A turning point in theorizing about dream function came in 1953, when
   Science published the Aserinsky and Kleitman paper^[44] establishing
   REM sleep as a distinct phase of sleep and linking dreams to REM
   sleep.^[45] Until and even after publication of the Solms 2000 paper
   that certified the separability of REM sleep and dream phenomena,^[16]
   many studies purporting to uncover the function of dreams have in fact
   been studying not dreams but measurable REM sleep.

   Theories of dream function since the identification of REM sleep
   include:

   Hobson's and McCarley's 1977 activation-synthesis hypothesis, which
   proposed "a functional role for dreaming sleep in promoting some aspect
   of the learning process...."^[46] In 2010 a Harvard study was published
   showing experimental evidence that dreams were correlated with improved
   learning.^[47]

   Crick's and Mitchison's 1983 "reverse learning" theory, which states
   that dreams are like the cleaning-up operations of computers when they
   are offline, removing (suppressing) parasitic nodes and other "junk"
   from the mind during sleep.^[48]^[49]

   Hartmann's 1995 proposal that dreams serve a "quasi-therapeutic"
   function, enabling the dreamer to process trauma in a safe place.^[50]

   Revonsuo's 2000 threat simulation hypothesis, whose premise is that
   during much of human evolution, physical and interpersonal threats were
   serious, giving reproductive advantage to those who survived them.
   Dreaming aided survival by replicating these threats and providing the
   dreamer with practice in dealing with them.^[51] In 2015, Revonsuo
   proposed social simulation theory, which describes dreams as a
   simulation for training social skills and bonds.^[52]

   Eagleman's and Vaughn's 2021 defensive activation theory, which says
   that, given the brain's neuroplasticity, dreams evolved as a visual
   hallucinatory activity during sleep's extended periods of darkness,
   busying the occipital lobe and thereby protecting it from possible
   appropriation by other, non-vision, sense operations.^[53]

   Erik Hoel proposes, based on artificial neural networks, that dreams
   prevent overfitting to past experiences; that is, they enable the
   dreamer to learn from novel situations.^[54]^[55]

Religious and other cultural contexts

   Dreams figure prominently in major world religions. The dream
   experience for early humans, according to one interpretation, gave rise
   to the notion of a human "soul",^[56] a central element in much
   religious thought. J. W. Dunne wrote:

     But there can be no reasonable doubt that the idea of a soul must
     have first arisen in the mind of primitive man as a result of
     observation of his dreams. Ignorant as he was, he could have come to
     no other conclusion but that, in dreams, he left his sleeping body
     in one universe and went wandering off into another. It is
     considered that, but for that savage, the idea of such a thing as a
     'soul' would never have even occurred to mankind....^[57]

Hindu

   In the Mandukya Upanishad, part of the Veda scriptures of Indian
   Hinduism, a dream is one of three states that the soul experiences
   during its lifetime, the other two states being the waking state and
   the sleep state.^[58] The earliest Upanishads, written before 300 BCE,
   emphasize two meanings of dreams. The first says that dreams are merely
   expressions of inner desires. The second is the belief of the soul
   leaving the body and being guided until awakened.

Abrahamic

   ladder of angels, c. 1690. Michael Willmann

   In Judaism, dreams are considered part of the experience of the world
   that can be interpreted and from which lessons can be garnered. It is
   discussed in the Talmud, Tractate Berachot 55-60.

   The ancient Hebrews connected their dreams heavily with their religion,
   though the Hebrews were monotheistic and believed that dreams were the
   voice of one God alone. Hebrews also differentiated between good dreams
   (from God) and bad dreams (from evil spirits). The Hebrews, like many
   other ancient cultures, incubated dreams in order to receive a divine
   revelation. For example, the Hebrew prophet Samuel would "lie down and
   sleep in the temple at Shiloh before the Ark and receive the word of
   the Lord", and Joseph interpreted a Pharaoh's dream of seven lean cows
   swallowing seven fat cows as meaning the subsequent seven years would
   be bountiful, followed by seven years of famine. Most of the dreams in
   the Bible are in the Book of Genesis.^[59]

   Christians mostly shared the beliefs of the Hebrews and thought that
   dreams were of a supernatural character because the Old Testament
   includes frequent stories of dreams with divine inspiration. The most
   famous of these dream stories was Jacob's dream of a ladder that
   stretches from Earth to Heaven. Many Christians preach that God can
   speak to people through their dreams. The famous glossary, the Somniale
   Danielis, written in the name of Daniel, attempted to teach Christian
   populations to interpret their dreams.

   Iain R. Edgar has researched the role of dreams in Islam.^[60] He has
   argued that dreams play an important role in the history of Islam and
   the lives of Muslims, since dream interpretation is the only way that
   Muslims can receive revelations from God since the death of the last
   prophet, Muhammad.^[61] According to Edgar, Islam classifies three
   types of dreams.^[62] Firstly, there is the true dream (al-ru'ya), then
   the false dream, which may come from the devil (shaytan), and finally,
   the meaningless everyday dream (hulm). This last dream could be brought
   forth by the dreamer's ego or base appetite based on what they
   experienced in the real world. The true dream is often indicated by
   Islam's hadith tradition.^[61] In one narration by Aisha, the wife of
   the Prophet, it is said that the Prophet's dreams would come true like
   the ocean's waves.^[61] Just as in its predecessors, the Quran also
   recounts the story of Joseph and his unique ability to interpret
   dreams.^[61]

   In both Christianity and Islam dreams feature in conversion
   stories.^[63] According to ancient authors, Constantine the Great
   started his conversion to Christianity because he had a dream which
   prophesied that he would win the battle of the Milvian Bridge if he
   adopted the Chi-Rho as his battle standard."^[64]^[65]

Buddhist

   In Buddhism, ideas about dreams are similar to the classical and folk
   traditions in South Asia. The same dream is sometimes experienced by
   multiple people, as in the case of the Buddha-to-be, before he is
   leaving his home. It is described in the Mahavastu that several of the
   Buddha's relatives had premonitory dreams preceding this. Some dreams
   are also seen to transcend time: the Buddha-to-be has certain dreams
   that are the same as those of previous Buddhas, the Lalitavistara
   states. In Buddhist literature, dreams often function as a "signpost"
   motif to mark certain stages in the life of the main character.^[66]

   Buddhist views about dreams are expressed in the Pali Commentaries and
   the Milinda Pañha.^[66]

Other

   In Chinese history, people wrote of two vital aspects of the soul of
   which one is freed from the body during slumber to journey in a dream
   realm, while the other remained in the body.^[67] This belief and dream
   interpretation had been questioned since early times, such as by the
   philosopher Wang Chong (27-97 CE).^[67]

   The Babylonians and Assyrians divided dreams into "good," which were
   sent by the gods, and "bad," sent by demons.^[68] A surviving
   collection of dream omens entitled Iskar Zaqiqu records various dream
   scenarios as well as prognostications of what will happen to the person
   who experiences each dream, apparently based on previous
   cases.^[6]^[69] Some list different possible outcomes, based on
   occasions in which people experienced similar dreams with different
   results.^[6] The Greeks shared their beliefs with the Egyptians on how
   to interpret good and bad dreams, and the idea of incubating dreams.
   Morpheus, the Greek god of dreams, also sent warnings and prophecies to
   those who slept at shrines and temples. The earliest Greek beliefs
   about dreams were that their gods physically visited the dreamers,
   where they entered through a keyhole, exiting the same way after the
   divine message was given.

   Antiphon wrote the first known Greek book on dreams in the 5th century
   BCE. In that century, other cultures influenced Greeks to develop the
   belief that souls left the sleeping body.^[70] The father of modern
   medicine, Hippocrates (460-375 BCE), thought dreams could analyze
   illness and predict diseases.^[71] For instance, a dream of a dim star
   high in the night sky indicated problems in the head region, while low
   in the night sky indicated bowel issues.^[72]^[73] Galen (129-216 AD)
   believed the same thing.^[74] Greek philosopher Plato (427-347 BCE)
   wrote that people harbor secret, repressed desires, such as incest,
   murder, adultery, and conquest, which build up during the day and run
   rampant during the night in dreams.^[75] Plato's student, Aristotle
   (384-322 BCE), believed dreams were caused by processing incomplete
   physiological activity during sleep, such as eyes trying to see while
   the sleeper's eyelids were closed.^[76] Marcus Tullius Cicero, for his
   part, believed that all dreams are produced by thoughts and
   conversations a dreamer had during the preceding days.^[77] Cicero's
   Somnium Scipionis described a lengthy dream vision, which in turn was
   commented on by Macrobius in his Commentarii in Somnium Scipionis.

   Herodotus in his The Histories, writes "The visions that occur to us in
   dreams are, more often than not, the things we have been concerned
   about during the day."^[78]

   The Dreaming is a common term within the animist creation narrative of
   indigenous Australians for a personal, or group, creation and for what
   may be understood as the "timeless time" of formative creation and
   perpetual creating.^[79]

   Some Indigenous American tribes and Mexican populations believe that
   dreams are a way of visiting and having contact with their
   ancestors.^[80] Some Native American tribes have used vision quests as
   a rite of passage, fasting and praying until an anticipated guiding
   dream was received, to be shared with the rest of the tribe upon their
   return.^[81]^[82]

Interpretation

   Interprets Pharaoh's Dream c. 1896-1902. Jacques Joseph Tissot
   (1836-1902).

   Beginning in the late 19th century, Austrian neurologist Sigmund Freud,
   founder of psychoanalysis, theorized that dreams reflect the dreamer's
   unconscious mind and specifically that dream content is shaped by
   unconscious wish fulfillment. He argued that important unconscious
   desires often relate to early childhood memories and experiences.^[7]
   Carl Jung and others expanded on Freud's idea that dream content
   reflects the dreamer's unconscious desires.

   Dream interpretation can be a result of subjective ideas and
   experiences. One study found that most people believe that "their
   dreams reveal meaningful hidden truths".^[83] The researchers surveyed
   students in the United States, South Korea, and India, and found that
   74% of Indians, 65% of South Koreans and 56% of Americans believed
   their dream content provided them with meaningful insight into their
   unconscious beliefs and desires. This Freudian view of dreaming was
   believed significantly more than theories of dreaming that attribute
   dream content to memory consolidation, problem-solving, or as a
   byproduct of unrelated brain activity. The same study found that people
   attribute more importance to dream content than to similar thought
   content that occurs while they are awake. Americans were more likely to
   report that they would intentionally miss their flight if they dreamt
   of their plane crashing than if they thought of their plane crashing
   the night before flying (while awake), and that they would be as likely
   to miss their flight if they dreamt of their plane crashing the night
   before their flight as if there was an actual plane crash on the route
   they intended to take. Participants in the study were more likely to
   perceive dreams to be meaningful when the content of dreams was in
   accordance with their beliefs and desires while awake. They were more
   likely to view a positive dream about a friend to be meaningful than a
   positive dream about someone they disliked, for example, and were more
   likely to view a negative dream about a person they disliked as
   meaningful than a negative dream about a person they liked.

   According to surveys, it is common for people to feel their dreams are
   predicting subsequent life events.^[84] Psychologists have explained
   these experiences in terms of memory biases, namely a selective memory
   for accurate predictions and distorted memory so that dreams are
   retrospectively fitted onto life experiences.^[84] The multi-faceted
   nature of dreams makes it easy to find connections between dream
   content and real events.^[85] The term "veridical dream" has been used
   to indicate dreams that reveal or contain truths not yet known to the
   dreamer, whether future events or secrets.^[86]

   In one experiment, subjects were asked to write down their dreams in a
   diary. This prevented the selective memory effect, and the dreams no
   longer seemed accurate about the future.^[87] Another experiment gave
   subjects a fake diary of a student with apparently precognitive dreams.
   This diary described events from the person's life, as well as some
   predictive dreams and some non-predictive dreams. When subjects were
   asked to recall the dreams they had read, they remembered more of the
   successful predictions than unsuccessful ones.^[88]

   Graphic artists, writers and filmmakers all have found dreams to offer
   a rich vein for creative expression. In the West, artists' depictions
   of dreams in Renaissance and Baroque art often were related to Biblical
   narrative. Especially preferred by visual artists were the Jacob's
   Ladder dream in Genesis and St. Joseph's dreams in the Gospel according
   to Matthew.

   Many later graphic artists have depicted dreams, including Japanese
   woodblock artist Hokusai (1760-1849) and Western European painters
   Rousseau (1844-1910), Picasso (1881-1973), and Dalí (1904-1989).

   In literature, dream frames were frequently used in medieval allegory
   to justify the narrative; The Book of the Duchess^[89] and The Vision
   Concerning Piers Plowman^[90] are two such dream visions. Even before
   them, in antiquity, the same device had been used by Cicero and Lucian
   of Samosata.

   edition

   Dreams have also featured in fantasy and speculative fiction since the
   19th century. One of the best-known dream worlds is Wonderland from
   Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, as well as
   Looking-Glass Land from its sequel, Through the Looking-Glass. Unlike
   many dream worlds, Carroll's logic is like that of actual dreams, with
   transitions and flexible causality.

   Other fictional dream worlds include the Dreamlands of H. P.
   Lovecraft's Dream Cycle^[91] and The Neverending Story's^[92] world of
   Fantastica, which includes places like the Desert of Lost Dreams, the
   Sea of Possibilities and the Swamps of Sadness. Dreamworlds, shared
   hallucinations and other alternate realities feature in a number of
   works by Philip K. Dick, such as The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch
   and Ubik. Similar themes were explored by Jorge Luis Borges, for
   instance in The Circular Ruins.

   Modern popular culture often conceives of dreams, as did Freud, as
   expressions of the dreamer's deepest fears and desires.^[93] In
   speculative fiction, the line between dreams and reality may be blurred
   even more in service to the story.^[94] Dreams may be psychically
   invaded or manipulated (Dreamscape, 1984; the Nightmare on Elm Street
   films, 1984-2010; Inception, 2010) or even come literally true (as in
   The Lathe of Heaven, 1971).^[93]

Lucidity

   Main article: Lucid dream

   Lucid dreaming is the conscious perception of one's state while
   dreaming. In this state the dreamer may often have some degree of
   control over their own actions within the dream or even the characters
   and the environment of the dream. Dream control has been reported to
   improve with practiced deliberate lucid dreaming, but the ability to
   control aspects of the dream is not necessary for a dream to qualify as
   "lucid"--a lucid dream is any dream during which the dreamer knows they
   are dreaming.^[95] The occurrence of lucid dreaming has been
   scientifically verified.^[96]

   "Oneironaut" is a term sometimes used for those who lucidly dream.

   In 1975, psychologist Keith Hearne successfully recorded a
   communication from a dreamer experiencing a lucid dream. On April 12,
   1975, after agreeing to move his eyes left and right upon becoming
   lucid, the subject and Hearne's co-author on the resulting article,
   Alan Worsley, successfully carried out this task.^[97] Years later,
   psychophysiologist Stephen LaBerge conducted similar work including:
     * Using eye signals to map the subjective sense of time in dreams.
     * Comparing the electrical activity of the brain while singing awake
       and while dreaming.
     * Studies comparing in-dream sex, arousal, and orgasm.^[98]

   Communication between two dreamers has also been documented. The
   processes involved included EEG monitoring, ocular signaling,
   incorporation of reality in the form of red light stimuli and a
   coordinating website. The website tracked when both dreamers were
   dreaming and sent the stimulus to one of the dreamers where it was
   incorporated into the dream. This dreamer, upon becoming lucid,
   signaled with eye movements; this was detected by the website whereupon
   the stimulus was sent to the second dreamer, invoking incorporation
   into that dreamer's dream.^[99]

Recollection

   Further information: Dream diary

   [250px-Riepenhausen_Raphael%27s_dream.jpg] Raphael's dream (1821).
   Johannes Riepenhausen and Franz Riepenhausen.

   The recollection of dreams is extremely unreliable, though it is a
   skill that can be trained. Dreams can usually be recalled if a person
   is awakened while dreaming.^[100] Women tend to have more frequent
   dream recall than men.^[100] Dreams that are difficult to recall may be
   characterized by relatively little affect, and factors such as
   salience, arousal, and interference play a role in dream recall. Often,
   a dream may be recalled upon viewing or hearing a random trigger or
   stimulus. The salience hypothesis proposes that dream content that is
   salient, that is, novel, intense, or unusual, is more easily
   remembered. There is considerable evidence that vivid, intense, or
   unusual dream content is more frequently recalled.^[101] A dream
   journal can be used to assist dream recall, for personal interest or
   psychotherapy purposes.

   Adults report remembering around two dreams per week, on
   average.^[102]^[103] Unless a dream is particularly vivid and if one
   wakes during or immediately after it, the content of the dream is
   typically not remembered.^[104]

   In line with the salience hypothesis, there is considerable evidence
   that people who have more vivid, intense or unusual dreams show better
   recall. There is evidence that continuity of consciousness is related
   to recall. Specifically, people who have vivid and unusual experiences
   during the day tend to have more memorable dream content and hence
   better dream recall. People who score high on measures of personality
   traits associated with creativity, imagination, and fantasy, such as
   openness to experience, daydreaming, fantasy proneness, absorption, and
   hypnotic susceptibility, tend to show more frequent dream recall.^[101]
   There is also evidence for continuity between the bizarre aspects of
   dreaming and waking experience. That is, people who report more bizarre
   experiences during the day, such as people high in schizotypy
   (psychosis proneness), have more frequent dream recall and also report
   more frequent nightmares.^[101]

Dream-recording machine

   Recording or reconstructing dreams may one day assist with dream
   recall.^[105]^[106] Using the permitted non-invasive technologies,
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electromyography
   (EMG), researchers have been able to identify basic dream
   imagery,^[107] dream speech activity^[108] and dream motor behavior
   (such as walking and hand movements).^[109]^[110]

Illusion of reality

   Main article: Dream argument

   Some philosophers have proposed that what we think of as the "real
   world" could be or is an illusion (an idea known as the skeptical
   hypothesis about ontology). The first recorded mention of the idea was
   in the 4th century BCE by Zhuangzi, and in Eastern philosophy, the
   problem has been named the "Zhuangzi Paradox."

     He who dreams of drinking wine may weep when morning comes; he who
     dreams of weeping may in the morning go off to hunt. While he is
     dreaming he does not know it is a dream, and in his dream he may
     even try to interpret a dream. Only after he wakes does he know it
     was a dream. And someday there will be a great awakening when we
     know that this is all a great dream. Yet the stupid believe they are
     awake, busily and brightly assuming they understand things, calling
     this man ruler, that one herdsman--how dense! Confucius and you are
     both dreaming! And when I say you are dreaming, I am dreaming, too.
     Words like these will be labeled the Supreme Swindle. Yet, after ten
     thousand generations, a great sage may appear who will know their
     meaning, and it will still be as though he appeared with astonishing
     speed.^[111]

   The idea also is discussed in Hindu and Buddhist writings.^[112] It was
   formally introduced to Western philosophy by Descartes in the 17th
   century in his Meditations on First Philosophy.

Absent-minded transgression

   Dreams of absent-minded transgression (DAMT) are dreams wherein the
   dreamer absent-mindedly performs an action that he or she has been
   trying to stop (one classic example is of a quitting smoker having
   dreams of lighting a cigarette). Subjects who have had DAMT have
   reported waking with intense feelings of guilt. One study found a
   positive association between having these dreams and successfully
   stopping the behavior.^[113]

Non-REM dreams

   Hypnogogic and hypnopompic dreams, dreamlike states shortly after
   falling asleep and shortly before awakening, and dreams during stage 2
   of NREM-sleep, also occur, but are shorter than REM-dreams.^[114]^[115]

Daydreams

   Main article: Daydream

   [250px-Joseph_Noel_Paton_-_Dante_Meditating.jpg] Dante Meditating,
   1852, by Joseph Noel Paton

   A daydream is a visionary fantasy, especially one of happy, pleasant
   thoughts, hopes or ambitions, imagined as coming to pass, and
   experienced while awake.^[116] There are many different types of
   daydreams, and there is no consistent definition amongst
   psychologists.^[116] The general public also uses the term for a broad
   variety of experiences. Research by Harvard psychologist Deirdre
   Barrett has found that people who experience vivid dreamlike mental
   images reserve the word for these, whereas many other people refer to
   milder imagery, realistic future planning, review of memories or just
   "spacing out"--i.e. one's mind going relatively blank--when they talk
   about "daydreaming".^[117]^[118]

   While daydreaming has long been derided as a lazy, non-productive
   pastime, it is now commonly acknowledged that daydreaming can be
   constructive in some contexts.^[119] There are numerous examples of
   people in creative or artistic careers, such as composers, novelists
   and filmmakers, developing new ideas through daydreaming. Similarly,
   research scientists, mathematicians and physicists have developed new
   ideas by daydreaming about their subject areas.

Hallucination

   Main article: Hallucination

   A hallucination, in the broadest sense of the word, is a perception in
   the absence of a stimulus. In a stricter sense, hallucinations are
   perceptions in a conscious and awake state, in the absence of external
   stimuli, and have qualities of real perception, in that they are vivid,
   substantial, and located in external objective space. The latter
   definition distinguishes hallucinations from the related phenomena of
   dreaming, which does not involve wakefulness.

Nightmare

   Main article: Nightmare

   [250px-A_perturbed_young_woman_fast_asleep_Wellcome_V0016638.jpg] Woman
   having a nightmare. Jean-Pierre Simon (1764-1810 or 1813).

   A nightmare is an unpleasant dream that can cause a strong negative
   emotional response from the mind, typically fear or horror, but also
   despair, anxiety and great sadness. The dream may contain situations of
   danger, discomfort, psychological or physical terror. Sufferers usually
   awaken in a state of distress and may be unable to return to sleep for
   a prolonged period of time.^[120]

Night terror

   Main article: Night terror

   A night terror, also known as a sleep terror or pavor nocturnus, is a
   parasomnia disorder that predominantly affects children, causing
   feelings of terror or dread. Night terrors should not be confused with
   nightmares, which are bad dreams that cause the feeling of horror or
   fear.^[121]

Déjà vu

   Main article: Déjà vu

   One theory of déjà vu attributes the feeling of having previously seen
   or experienced something to having dreamed about a similar situation or
   place, and forgetting about it until one seems to be mysteriously
   reminded of the situation or the place while awake.^[122]

Melatonin

   Main article: Melatonin

   Melatonin is a natural hormone secreted by the brain's pineal gland,
   inducing nocturnal behaviors in animals and sleep in humans during
   nighttime. Chemically isolated in 1958, melatonin has been marketed as
   a sleep aid since the 1990s and is currently sold in the United States
   as an over-the-counter product requiring no prescription. Anecdotal
   reports and formal research studies over the past few decades have
   established a link between melatonin supplementation and more vivid
   dreams.^[123]

   Have you ever dreamed about someone you know?

   Dreams are a mix of the strange and the familiar. While sometimes in
   nighttime dreams we interact with people we've never met before, often
   we find that we know the people we see and speak to while asleep. Is
   there something for us to learn in these interactions?

   Perhaps surprisingly, the material in our night dreams and even
   daydreams offer unexpected ways to improve our existing, waking
   relationships. With a little reflection, they can help us expand our
   self-awareness and provide insights about the ways we interact with
   others. Here are three tools for using our nighttime dreams and
   daydreaming to improve our relationships.

Relationship Tool 1: Dreams Hold Other Perspectives

   Challenges are inevitable in any relationship. However, when we
   encounter relationship roadblocks, we usually retreat to our most
   familiar scripts, seeing the other person through a narrow lens. When
   we're angry at a spouse, for example, it may seem impossible to
   remember them as the person we fell in love with; a flare-up with our
   boss and we forget what a chance they took on us early in our career.
   Yet our nighttime dreams can help return us to a more expanded view.

   While we dream about people we know in waking time, rarely do the
   familiar faces in our dreams behave exactly as we would expect them to
   in waking life. The staid, strict mother is suddenly carefree; the
   couch-surfing, irresponsible brother-in-law now owns a modern, upscale
   house. Waking up, we have the possibility to curiously reflect on the
   differences. We can ask ourselves whether there is something more or
   different to the person than the way we've been viewing them in waking
   time.

   Often the difference between a person in our dreams and the way we
   perceive them in waking life puts the new perspectives into motion
   without much effort. From time to time, though, we might even get
   something more direct. For example, once I dreamed of a work colleague
   who, in waking life, was critical of new ideas, making discussions
   difficult. In the dream, the same person knocked on my door and, when I
   opened it, said, "I'm not such a bad egg, after all."

   In the dream, I simply listened, then shut the door. But in the
   morning, reflecting on the dream, I asked myself whether there was
   something I was missing. The next time a prickly work conversation
   arose I decided to be curious instead of closed off. I noticed that
   underlying the criticisms of new ideas was a respect for process and
   stability. I appreciated such a point of view, and my own prickliness
   eased as a result, shifting our dialogues.

Relationship Tool 2: Imagining How the Other Person Feels

   Most impasses begin with our own hurt feelings. To move out of that, we
   have to bring in other perspectives, including that of the other
   person.

   Daydreaming utilizes the same default network of neural processing that
   operates in our night dreams. We think about this cognitive powerhouse
   as the seat of the imagination, but we also use it to evaluate
   sociomoral scenarios. For example, we use it to reflect on an event and
   the different ways that it could have played out, or to consider how
   other people may have felt about our actions.

   If you think about it, it takes imagination to step into someone else's
   shoes and sense how they might feel. Likewise, it takes creativity to
   come up with solutions for moving out of conflict and back to
   communication. Imagining the same event from the other person's point
   of view, and finding new ways of seeing the situation, helps us move
   beyond impasses and back to dialogue.

Relationship Tool 3: "They" Are Me

   One approach to understanding dreams is to view each of the aspects of
   a dream as an aspect of the dreamer. In other words, the people we
   think of as being separate others are in fact reflecting a part of our
   own self.

   What better way to engender compassion than to remember our own
   multiple facets, including the occasional less-favorable qualities and
   traits we tend to assign to others. Peering into the mirror of our
   dreams, we can consider, for example, our own moments of acting staid
   and rigid, shirking responsibility, or being a bad egg.

   What Are Dreams Made Of?

   We all have moments that could use a little tweaking, and recognizing
   that can open a door to renewed conversation. At the same time, the
   myriad perspectives in our dreams remind us that whatever our current
   facet, it is merely one of many aspects, and others are available.
   Knowing that helps us to shift into a more positive aspect of
   ourselves.

   Dreams and our imagination offer a library of feelings, solutions,
   perspectives, and experiences that we can draw on to recognize more
   about ourselves and our relationships. We can get along better with
   others, and in the world, simply by looking within at this treasure
   trove that our own mind generates for us on a nightly basis, or that we
   sink into in our daydreaming. You'll be surprised how much you can
   learn from people you meet (and know) when you close your eyes.

Philosophy of Dreaming

   According to Owen Flanagan (2000), there are four major philosophical
   questions about dreaming:

   1. How can I be sure I am not always dreaming?

   2. Can I be immoral in dreams?

   3. Are dreams conscious experiences that occur during sleep?

   4. Does dreaming have an evolutionary function?

   These interrelated questions cover philosophical domains as diverse as
   metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, scientific methodology, and the
   philosophy of biology, mind and language. This article covers the four
   questions and also looks at some newly emerging philosophical questions
   about dreams:

   5. Is dreaming an ideal scientific model for consciousness research?

   6. Is dreaming an instance of hallucinating or imagining?

   Section 1 introduces the traditional philosophical question that
   Descartes asked himself, a question which has championed scepticism
   about the external world. How can I be sure I am not always dreaming,
   or dreaming right now? Philosophers have typically looked for features
   that distinguish dreams from waking life and one key debate centres on
   whether it is possible to feel pain in a dream.

   Section 2 surveys the ethics of dreaming. The classical view of
   Augustine is contrasted with more abstract ethical positions, namely,
   those of the Deontologist, the Consequentialist and the Virtue
   Ethicist. The notion of lucid dreaming is examined here in light of the
   question of responsibility during dreaming and how we treat other dream
   characters.

   Sections 3 covers the various different positions, objections and
   replies to question 3: the debate about whether dreaming is, or is not,
   a conscious state. The challenges from Malcolm and Dennett are covered.
   These challenges question the authority of the common-sense view of
   dreaming as a consciously experienced state. Malcolm argues that the
   concept of dreaming is incoherent, while Dennett puts forward a theory
   of dreaming without appealing to consciousness.

   Section 4 covers the evolutionary debate, where empirical work
   ultimately leaves us uncertain of the extent to which natural selection
   has shaped dreaming, if at all. Early approaches by Freud and Jung are
   reviewed, followed by approaches by Flanagan and Revonsuo. Though
   Freud, Jung and Revonsuo have argued that dreaming is functional,
   Flanagan represents a view shared by many neuroscientists that dreaming
   has no function at all.

   Section 5 looks at questions 5 and 6. Question 5 is about the cutting
   edge issue of precisely how dreaming should be integrated into the
   research program of consciousness. Should dreaming be taken as a
   scientific model of consciousness? Might dreaming play another role
   such as a contrast analysis with other mental states? Question 6, which
   raises a question of the exact qualitative nature of dreaming, has a
   longer history, though it is also receiving contemporary attention. The
   section outlines reasons favouring the orthodox view of psychology,
   that dream imagery is perceptual (hallucinatory), and reasons favouring
   the philosophical challenge to that orthodoxy, that dreams are
   ultimately imaginative in nature.

1. Dreaming in Epistemology

a. Descartes' Dream Argument

   Descartes strove for certainty in the beliefs we hold. In his
   Meditations on First Philosophy he wanted to find out what we can
   believe with certainty and thereby claim as knowledge. He begins by
   stating that he is certain of being seated by the fire in front of him.
   He then dismisses the idea that this belief could be certain because he
   has been deceived before in dreams where he has similarly been
   convinced that he was seated by a fire, only to wake and discover that
   he was only dreaming that he was seated by a fire. How can I know that
   I am not now dreaming? is the resulting famous question Descartes asked
   himself. Though Descartes was not the first to ask himself this
   question (see Zhuangzi's eponymous work, Plato's Theaetetus and
   Aristotle's Metaphysics) he was the first philosopher to doggedly
   pursue and try to answer the question. In answering the question, due
   to the sensory deception of dreams, Descartes believes that we cannot
   trust our senses in waking life (without invoking a benevolent God who
   would surely not deceive us).

   The phenomenon of dreaming is used as key evidence for the sceptical
   hypothesis that everything we currently believe to be true could be
   false and generated by a dream. Descartes holds the common-sense view
   that dreams, which regularly occur in all people, are a sequence of
   experiences often similar to those we have in waking life (this has
   come to be labelled as the "received view" of dreaming). A dream makes
   it feel as though the dreamer is carrying out actions in waking life,
   for during a dream we do not realize that it is a dream we are
   experiencing. Descartes claims that the experience of a dream could in
   principle be indistinguishable from waking life - whatever apparent
   subjective differences there are between waking life and dreaming, they
   are insufficient differences to gain certainty that I am not now
   dreaming. Descartes is left unsure that the objects in front of him are
   real - whether he is dreaming of their existence or whether they really
   are there. Dreaming was the first source for motivating Descartes'
   method of doubt which came to threaten perceptual and introspective
   knowledge. In this method, he would use any means to subject a
   statement or allegedly true belief to the most critical scrutiny.

   Descartes' dream argument began with the claim that dreams and waking
   life can have the same content. There is, Descartes alleges, a
   sufficient similarity between the two experiences for dreamers to be
   routinely deceived into believing that they are having waking
   experiences while we are actually asleep and dreaming.  The dream
   argument has similarities to his later evil demon argument. According
   to this later argument, I cannot be sure anything I believe for I may
   just be being deceived by a malevolent demon. Both arguments have the
   same structure: nothing can rule out my being duped into believing I am
   having experience X, when I am really in state Y, hence I cannot have
   knowledge Z, about my current state. Even if the individuals happen to
   be right in their belief that they are not being deceived by an evil
   demon and even if individuals really are having a waking life
   experience, they are left unable to distinguish reality from their
   dream experiences in order to gain certainty in their belief that they
   are not now dreaming.

b. Objections and Replies

   Since the Meditations on First Philosophy was published, Descartes'
   argument has been replied to. One main claim that has been replied to
   is the idea that there are no certain marks to distinguish waking
   consciousness from dreaming. Hobbes believed that an absence of the
   absurd in waking life was a key difference (Hobbes, 1651: Part 1,
   Chapter 2). Though sleeping individuals are too wrapped up in the
   absurdity of their dreams to be able to distinguish their states, an
   individual who is awake can tell, simply because the absurdity is no
   longer there during wakefulness. Locke compared real pain to dream
   pain. He asks Descartes to consider the difference between dreaming of
   being in the fire and actually being in the fire (Locke, 1690: Book 4,
   Chapter 2, § 2). Locke's claim is that we cannot have physical pain in
   dreams as we do in waking life. His claim, if true, undermines
   Descartes' premise that there are no certain marks to distinguish
   dreaming from waking life such that we could ever be sure we are in one
   or the other states.

   Descartes thought that dreams are protean (Hill, 2004b). By "protean",
   Hill means that dream experience can replicate the panoply of any
   possible waking life experience; to put it negatively, there is no
   experience in waking life that could not be realistically simulated
   (and thereby be phenomenally indistinguishable) in dreams. This protean
   claim was necessary for Descartes to mount his sceptical argument about
   the external world. After all, if there was even one experience during
   waking life which simply could not occur during dreaming, then, in that
   moment at least, we could be sure we are awake and in contact with the
   external world, rather than dreaming. Locke alleged that he had found a
   gap in this protean claim: we do not and cannot feel pain in dreams.
   The notion of pain occurring in a dream has now been put to the test in
   a number of scientific studies through quantitative analysis of the
   content of dream diaries in the case of ordinary dreams and also by
   participating lucid dreamers. The conclusion reached independently by
   these various studies is that the occurrence of sharply localized pains
   can occur in dreams, though they are rare (Zadra, and others 1998;
   LaBerge & DeGracia, 2000). According to the empirical work then, Locke
   is wrong about his claim, though he might still query whether really
   agonizing and ongoing pain (as in his original request of being in a
   fire) might not be possible in dreams. The empirical work supports
   Descartes' conviction that dreams can recapitulate any waking state,
   meaning that there is no essential difference between waking and
   dreaming thereby ruling out certainty that this is not now a dream.

   Another common attempt to distinguish waking life from dreaming is the
   "principle of coherence" (Malcolm, 1959: Chapter 17). We are awake and
   not asleep dreaming if we can connect our current experiences to the
   overall course of our lives. Essentially, through using the principle
   of coherence, we can think more critically in waking life. Hobbes seems
   to adhere to something like the principle of coherence in his appeal to
   absurdity as a key feature of dreams. Though dreams do have a tendency
   to involve a lack of critical thinking, it still seems possible that we
   could wake with a dream connecting to the overall course of our lives.
   It is generally accepted that there is no certain way to distinguish
   dreaming from waking life, though the claim that this ought to
   undermine our knowledge in any way is controversial.

   For an alternative response to Descartes' sceptical dream argument see
   Sosa (2007), who says that "in dreaming we do not really believe; we
   only make-believe." He argues that in dreaming we actually only ever
   imagine scenarios, which never involve deceptive beliefs, and so we
   have no reason to feel our ordinary waking life beliefs can be
   undermined. Descartes relied on a notion of belief that was the same in
   both dreaming and waking life. Of course, if I have never believed, in
   sleep, that I was seated by the fire when I was actually asleep in bed,
   then none of my dreams challenge the perceptual and introspective
   beliefs I have during waking life. Ichikawa (2008) agrees with Sosa
   that in dreams we imagine scenarios (rather than believe we are engaged
   in scenarios as though awake), but he argues in contrast to Sosa, that
   this does not avoid scepticism about the external world. Even when
   dreams trade in imaginings rather than beliefs, the dreams still create
   subjectively indistinguishable experiences from waking experience. Due
   to the similarity in experience, it would be "epistemically
   irresponsible" to believe that we are engaged in waking experiences
   when we think we are on the sole basis that we imagine our dream
   experiences and imaginings are not beliefs. I still cannot really tell
   the difference between the experiences. The new worry is whether the
   belief I have in waking life is really a belief, rather than an
   imagining during dreaming and so scepticism is not avoided, so Ichikawa
   claims.

2. The Ethics of Dreaming

   Since the late twentieth century, discussion of the moral and criminal
   responsibility of dreaming has been centred on sleep walking, where
   sleep-walkers have harmed others. The assessment has typically been
   carried out in practical, rather than theoretical, settings, for
   example law courts. Setting aside the notion of sleepwalking,
   philosophers are more concerned with the phenomenology of ordinary
   dreams. Does the notion of right and wrong apply to dreams themselves,
   as well as actions done by sleepwalkers?

a. Saint Augustine on the Morality of Dreaming

   Saint Augustine, seeking to live a morally perfect life, was worried
   about some of the actions he carried out in dreams. For somebody who
   devoted his life to celibacy, his sexual dreams of fornication worried
   him. In his Confessions (Book X; Chapter 30), he writes to God. He
   talks of his success in quelling sexual thoughts and earlier habits
   from his life before his religious conversion. But he declares that in
   dreams he seems to have little control over committing the acts that he
   avoids during the waking day. He rhetorically asks "am I not myself
   during sleep?" believing that it really is him who is the central
   character of his dreams. In trying to solve the problem Augustine
   appeals to the apparent experiential difference between waking and
   dreaming life. He draws a crucial distinction between "happenings" and
   "actions." Dreams fall into the former category. Augustine was not
   carrying out actions but was rather undergoing an experience which
   happened to him without choice on his part. By effectively removing
   agency from dreaming, we cannot be responsible for what happens in our
   dreams. As a result, the notion of sin or moral responsibility cannot
   be applied to our dreams (Flanagan, 2000: p.18; pp. 179 - 183).
   According to Augustine, only actions are morally evaluable. He is
   committed to the claim that all events that occur in dreams are
   non-actions. The claim that actions do not occur during sleep is
   brought into question by lucid dreams which seem to involve genuine
   actions and decision making processes whereby dreaming individuals can
   control, affect and alter the course of the dream. The success of
   Augustine's argument hinges on there being no actions in dreams. Lucid
   dreaming is therefore evidence against this premise. We have now seen
   Augustine's argument that moral notions never apply to dreams fail
   (because they can involve actions rather than happenings). In the next
   section we will see what the two main ethical positions might say on
   the issue of right and wrong in dreams.

b. Consequentialist vs. Deontological Positions on Dreaming

   Dreaming is an instance of a more general concern about a subset of
   thoughts - fantasies - that occur, potentially without affecting
   behaviour We seem to carry out actions during dreams in simulated
   realities involving other characters. So perhaps we ought to consider
   whether we are morally responsible for actions in dreams. More
   generally, are we morally obliged to not entertain certain thoughts,
   even if these thoughts do not affect our later actions and do not harm
   others? The same issue might be pressed with the use of violent video
   games, though the link to later behaviour is more controversial. Some
   people enjoy playing violent video games and the more graphic the
   better. Is that unethical in and of itself? Why should we excuse
   people's thoughts - when, if they were carried out as actual actions
   they would be grossly wrong? Dreaming is perhaps a special instance
   because in ordinary dreams we believe we are carrying out actions in
   real life. What might the two main moral theories say about the issue,
   with the assumption in place that what we do in dreams does not affect
   our behaviour in waking life?

   Consequentialism is a broad family of ethical doctrines which always
   assesses an action in terms of the consequences it has. There are two
   separate issues - ethical and empirical. The empirical question asks
   whether dreams, fantasies and video games are really without
   behavioural consequence towards others. To be clear, the
   Consequentialist is not arguing that dreams do not have any
   consequences, only that if they really do have no consequences then
   they are not morally evaluable or should be deemed neutral.
   Consequentialist theories may well argue that, provided that dreams
   really do not affect my behaviour later, it is not morally wrong to
   "harm" other dream characters, even in lucid dreaming. The more liberal
   Consequentialists might even see value in these instances of free
   thought. That is, there might be some intrinsic good in allowing such
   freedom of the mind but this is not a value that can be outweighed by
   actual harm to others, so the Consequentialists might claim. If having
   such lucid dreams makes me nicer to people in waking life, then the
   Consequentialist will actually endorse such activity during sleep.

   Consequentialists will grant their argument even though dream content
   has an intentional relation to other people. Namely, dreams can often
   have singular content. Singular content, or singular thought, is to be
   contrasted with general content (the notion of singular thought is
   somewhat complex. Readers should consult Jeshion, 2010). If I simply
   form a mental representation of a blond Hollywood actor, the features
   of the representation might be too vague to pick out any particular
   individual. My representation could equally be fulfilled by Brad Pitt,
   Steve McQueen, a fictional movie star or countless other individuals.
   If I deliberately think of Brad Pitt, or if the images come to me
   detailed enough, then my thought does not have general content but is
   about that particular individual. Dreams are not always about people
   with general features (though they can be), but are rather often about
   people the sleeping individual is actually acquainted with - particular
   people from that individual's own life - family, friends, and so forth.

   Deontological theories, in stark contrast to Consequential theories,
   believe that we have obligations to act and think, or not act and
   think, in certain ways regardless of effects on other people. According
   to Deontological moral theories, I have a duty to never entertain
   certain thoughts because it is wrong in itself. Deontological theories
   see individuals as more important than mere consequences of action.
   Individuals are "ends-in-themselves" and not the means to a desirable
   state of affairs. Since dreams are often actually about real people, I
   am not treating that individual as an end-in-itself if I chose to harm
   their "dream representative". The basic Deontological maxim to treat
   someone as an end rather than a means to my entertainment can apply to
   dreams.

   As the debate between Deontologists and Consequentialists plays out,
   nuanced positions will reveal themselves. Perhaps there is room for
   agreement between the Consequentialist and Deontologist. Maybe I can
   carry out otherwise immoral acts on dream characters with general
   features where these characters do not represent any particular
   individuals of the waking world. Some Deontologists might still be
   unhappy with the notion that in dreams one crucial element of singular
   content remains - we represent ourselves in dreams. The
   arch-Deontologist Kant will argue that one is not treating oneself as
   an end-in-itself but a means to other ends by carrying out the acts;
   namely, there is something inherently wrong about even pretending to
   carry out an immoral action because in doing so we depersonalize
   ourselves. Other Deontologists might want to speak about fantasies
   being different from dreams. Fantasies are actions, where I sit down
   and decide to indulge my daydreams, whereas dreams might be more
   passive and therefore might respect the Augustinian distinction between
   actions and happenings. On this view, I am not using someone as a means
   to an end if I am just passively dreaming whereas I am if I start
   actively thinking about that individual. So maybe the Deontologist case
   only applies to lucid dreaming, where Augustine's distinction would
   still be at work. This might exempt a large number of dreams from being
   wicked, but not all of them.

c. Virtue Ethics of Dreaming

   Deontology and Consequentialism are the two main moral positions. The
   third is Virtue Ethics, which emphasizes the role of character. This
   moral approach involves going beyond actions of right and wrong,
   avoiding harm and maximizing pleasure, and instead considers an
   individual for his or her overall life, how to make it a good one and
   develop that individual's character. Where might dreaming fit in with
   the third moral position - that of the Virtue Ethicist? Virtue Ethics
   takes the question "what is the right action?" and turns it into the
   broader question: "how should I live?" The question "can we have
   immoral dreams?" needs to be opened up to: "what can I get out of
   dreaming to help me acquire virtuousness?"

   The Virtue Ethics of dreaming might be pursued in a Freudian or Jungian
   vein. Dreams arguably put us in touch with our unconscious and
   indirectly tell us about our motives and habits in life:

   "[I]t is in the world of dreaming that the unconscious is working out
   its powerful dynamics. It is there that the great forces do battle or
   combine to produce the attitudes, ideals, beliefs, and compulsions that
   motivate most of our behavior Once we become sensitive to dreams, we
   discover that every dynamic in a dream is manifesting itself in some
   way in our practical lives--in our actions, relationships, decisions,
   automatic routines, urges, and feelings." (Johnson, 2009: p.19)

   Similarly:

   "Studying our own dreams can be valuable in all sorts of ways. They can
   be reveal our inner motivations and hopes, help us face our fears,
   encourage growing awareness and even be a source of creativity and
   insight." (Blackmore, 2004: p.338)

   In order to achieve happiness, fulfilment and developing virtuousness
   we owe it to ourselves to recall and pay attention to our dreams.
   However, this line of argument relies on the claim that dreams really
   do function in a way that Freud or Jung thought they do, which is
   controversial: dream analysis of any kind lacks scientific status and
   is more of an art. But then social dynamics and the development of
   character is more of an art than a science. Virtue Ethics is perhaps
   the opposite side of the coin of psychotherapy. The former focuses on
   positive improvement of character, whereas the latter focuses on
   avoiding negative setbacks in mind and behaviour Whether psychotherapy
   should be used more for positive improvement of character is a question
   approached in the philosophy of medicine. These considerations touch on
   a further question of whether dreams should be used in therapy.

   Certain changes people make in waking life do eventually "show up" in
   dreams. Dreams, as unconsciously instantiated, capture patterns of
   thought from waking life. New modes of thinking can be introduced and
   this is the process by which people learn to lucid dream. By
   periodically introducing thoughts about whether one is awake or not
   during the day, every day for some period of time, this pattern of
   thinking eventually occurs in dreams. By constantly asking "am I
   awake?" in the day it becomes more likely to ask oneself in a dream, to
   realize that one is not awake and answer in the negative (Blackmore,
   1991). With the possibility that dreams do capture waking life thinking
   and the notion that one can learn to lucid dream one may ask whether
   Augustine tried his hardest at stopping the dreams that troubled him
   and whether he was really as successful at quelling sexual urges in
   waking life as he thought he was.

   Ordinary dreams are commonly thought to not actually involve choices
   and corresponding agency. Lucid dreaming invokes our ability to make
   choices, often to the same extent as in waking life. Lucid dreaming
   represents an example of being able to live and act in a virtual
   reality and is especially timely due to the rise in number of lucid
   dreamers (popular manuals on how to lucid dream are sold and actively
   endorsed by some leading psychologists; see LaBerge & Rheingold, 1990;
   Love, 2013) and the increase of virtual realities on computers. Whereas
   Deontologists and Consequentialists are likely to be more interested in
   the content of the dreams, the Virtue Ethicist will likely be more
   interested in dreaming as an overall activity and how it fits in with
   one's life. Stephen LaBerge is perhaps an implicit Virtue Ethicist of
   dreaming. Though humans are thought to be moral agents, we spend a
   third of our lives asleep. 11% of our mental experiences are dreams
   (Love, 2013: p.2). The dreams we experience during sleep are mostly
   non-agentic and this amounts to a significant unfulfilled portion of
   our lives. LaBerge argues that by not cultivating lucid dreams, we miss
   out on opportunities to explore our own minds and ultimately enrich our
   waking lives (LaBerge & Rheingold, 1990: p.9). Arguably then, the
   fulfilled virtuous person will try to develop the skill of lucid
   dreaming. One could object that the dreamer should just get on with
   life in the real world. After all, learning to lucid dream for most
   people takes time and practice, requiring the individual to think about
   their dreams for periods of time in their waking life. They could be
   spending their time instead doing voluntary work for charity in real
   life. In reply, the Virtue Ethicist can show how parallel arguments can
   be made for meditation: individuals are calmer in situations that
   threaten their morality and are working on longer-term habits.
   Similarly, the lucid dreamer is achieving fulfilment and nurturing
   important long term traits and habits. By gaining control of dreams,
   there is the opportunity to examine relationships with people by
   representing them in dreams. Lucid dreams might aid in getting an
   individual to carry out a difficult task in real life by allowing them
   to practice it in life-like settings (that go beyond merely imagining
   the scenario in waking life). Lucid dreams may then help to play a role
   in developing traits that people otherwise would not develop, and act
   as an outlet for encouraging the "thick moral concepts" of oneself -
   courage, bravery, wisdom, and so forth. Lucid dreaming helps in
   developing such traits and so can be seen as a means to the end of
   virtuousness or act as a supplementary virtue. Human experience can be
   taken as any area in which a choice is required. At the very least
   then, lucid dreaming signifies an expansion of agency.

3. Are Dreams Consciously Experienced?

a. The Received View of Dreaming

   There is an implicit, unquestioned commitment in both Descartes' dream
   argument and Augustine's argument on the morality of dreaming. This is
   the received view, which is the platitudinous claim that a dream is a
   sequence of experiences that occur during sleep. The received view
   typically adheres to a number of further claims: that dreams play out
   approximately in real time and do not happen in a flash. When a dream
   is successfully remembered, the content of the dream is to a large
   extent what is remembered after waking (see Fig. 1 below), and an
   individual's dream report is taken as excellent evidence for that dream
   having taken place.

   Fig 1


   The received view is committed to the claim that we do not wake up with
   misleading memories. Any failure of memory is of omission rather than
   error. I might wake unable to recall the exact details of certain parts
   of a dream, but I will not wake up and believe I had a dream involving
   contents which did not occur (I might recall details A - G with D
   missing, but I will not wake and recall content X, Y, Z). The received
   view is not committed to a claim about exactly how long a dream takes
   to experience, in correlation to how long it takes to remember, but
   dreams cannot occur instantaneously during sleep. The received view is
   committed to the claim that dreams are extended in time during sleep.
   The content does not necessarily have to occur just before waking;
   another graph detailing possible experience and later recollection of
   dream content on the received view might show A - G occurring much
   earlier in sleep (with the recalled A* - G* in the same place). A - G
   can represent any dream that people ordinarily recall

   We can appear to carry out a scope of actions in our dreams pretty
   similar to those of waking life. Everything that we can do in waking
   life, we can also do in dreams. The exact same mental states can occur
   in dreams just as they do in waking life. We can believe, judge, reason
   and converse with what we take to be other individuals in our dreams.
   Since we can be frightened in a dream we can be frightened during
   sleep.

   The received view is attested by reports of dreams from ordinary people
   in laboratory and everyday settings. Every dreamer portrays the dream
   as a mental experience that occurred during sleep. The received view is
   hence a part of folk psychology which is the term given to denote the
   beliefs that ordinary people hold on matters concerning psychology such
   as the nature of mental states. When it comes to dreaming, the
   consensus (folk psychology, scientific psychology and philosophy) agree
   that dreams are experiences that occur during sleep.

b. Malcolm's Challenge to the Received View

   Malcolm stands in opposition to received view - the implicit set of
   claims about dreams that Descartes, Augustine and the majority of
   philosophers, psychologists and ordinary people are committed to. It
   will be worth separating Malcolm's challenge to the received view into
   three arguments: #1 dream reports are unverifiable; #2 sleep and
   dreaming have conflicting definitions; #3 communication and judgements
   cannot occur during sleep.

i. The Impossibility of Verifying Dream Reports

   According to Malcolm's first argument, we should not simply take dream
   reports at face value, as the received view has done; dream reports are
   insufficient to believe the metaphysical claim that dreaming
   consciously takes place during sleep. When we use introspection after
   sleeping to examine our episodic memories of dreams and put our dream
   report into words, these are not the dream experiences themselves.
   Malcolm adds that there is no other way to check the received view's
   primary claim that dreams are consciously experienced during sleep.
   Importantly, Malcolm states that the sole criterion we have for
   establishing that one has had a dream is that one awakes with the
   impression of having dreamt (that is, an apparent memory) and that one
   then goes on to report the dream. Waking with the impression does not
   entail that there was a conscious experience during sleep that actually
   corresponds to the report. Malcolm views dream reports as inherently
   first personal and repeatedly claims that the verbal report of a dream
   is the only criterion for believing that a dream took place. He adds
   that dreams cannot be checked in any other way without either showing
   that the individual is not fully asleep or by invoking a new conception
   of dreaming by relying on behavioural criteria such as patterns of
   physiology or movement during sleep. Behavioral criteria too, are
   insufficient to confirm that an individual is consciously experiencing
   their dreams, according to Malcolm. The best we can get from that are
   probabilistic indications of consciousness that will never be decisive.
   If scientists try to show that one is dreaming during sleep then those
   scientists have invoked a new conception of dreaming that does not
   resemble the old one, Malcolm alleges. He believes that where
   scientists appeal to behavioural criteria they are no longer inquiring
   into dreaming because the real conception of dreaming has only ever
   relied on dream reports. A dream is logically inseparable from the
   dream report and it cannot be assumed that the report refers to an
   experience during sleep. Malcolm thereby undermines the received view's
   claim that "I dreamed that I was flying" entails that I had an
   experience during sleep in which I believed I was flying. Hence there
   is no way of conclusively confirming the idea that dreaming occurs
   during sleep at all.

   Malcolm's claim that the received view is unverifiable is inspired by a
   statement made by Wittgenstein who alludes to the possibility that
   there is no way of finding out if the memory of a dream corresponds to
   the dream as it actually occurred (Wittgenstein, 1953: part 2, § vii;
   p.415). Wittgenstein asks us what we should do about a man who has an
   especially bad memory. How can we trust his reports of dreams? The
   received view is committed to a crucial premise that when we recall
   dreams we recall the same content of the earlier experience. But
   Wittgenstein's scenario establishes the possibility that an individual
   could recall content that did not occur. The question then arises as to
   why we should believe that somebody with even a good day-to-day memory
   is in any better position to remember earlier conscious experiences
   during sleep after waking.

   In drawing attention to empirical work on dreams, Malcolm says that
   psychologists have come to be uncertain whether dreams occur during
   sleep or during the moment of waking up. The point for Malcolm is that
   it is "impossible to decide" between the two (Malcolm, 1956: p.29).
   Hence the question "when, in his sleep, did he dream?" is senseless.
   There is also a lack of criterion for the duration of dreams, that is
   how long they last in real time. Malcolm states that the concept of the
   time of occurrence of a dream and also how long a dream might last has
   no application in ordinary conversation about dreams. "In this sense, a
   dream is not an `occurrence' and, therefore, not an occurrence during
   sleep" (Malcolm: 1956, p.30). Malcolm's epistemic claim has a
   metaphysical result, namely, that dreaming does not take place in time
   or space. The combination of the waking impression and the use of
   language has misled us into believing that dreams occur during sleep;
   "dreams" do not refer to anything over and above the waking report,
   according to Malcolm. This is why Malcolm thinks that the notion of
   "dreaming" is an exemplar of Wittgenstein's idea of prejudices
   "produced by `grammatical illusions'" (Malcolm, 1959: p. 75).

ii. The Conflicting Definitions of "Sleep" and "Dreaming"

   According to Malcolm's second argument, he accuses the received view of
   contradicting itself and so the claim that dreams could consciously
   occur during sleep is incoherent. Sleep is supposed to entail a lack of
   experiential content, or at least an absence of intended behaviour,
   whereas dreaming is said to involve conscious experience. Experience
   implies consciousness; sleep implies a lack of consciousness; therefore
   the claim that dreams could occur during sleep implies consciousness
   and a lack of consciousness. So the received view results in a
   contradiction. This alleged contradiction of sleep and dreaming
   supports Malcolm's first argument that dreams are unverifiable because
   any attempt to verify the dream report will just show that the
   individual was not asleep and so there is no way to verify that dreams
   could possibly occur during sleep. One might object to Malcolm that the
   content of a dream report could coincide well with a publicly
   verifiable event, such as the occurrence of thunder while the
   individual slept and thunder in the reported dream later. Malcolm
   claims that in this instance the individual could not be sound asleep
   if they are aware of their environment in any way. He alleges that
   instances such as nightmares and sleepwalking also invoke new
   conceptions of sleep and dreaming. By "sleep" Malcolm thinks that
   people have meant sound sleep as the paradigmatic example, namelessly,
   sleeping whilst showing no awareness of the outside environment and no
   behaviour.

iii. The Impossibility of Communicating or Making Judgments during Sleep

   Malcolm takes communication as a crucial way of verifying that a mental
   state could be experienced. His third argument rules out the
   possibility of individuals communicating or making judgements during
   sleep, essentially closing off dreams as things we can know anything
   about. This third argument supports the first argument that dreams are
   unverifiable and anticipates a counter-claim that individuals might be
   able to report a dream as it occurs, thereby verifying it as a
   conscious experience. Malcolm claims that a person cannot say and be
   aware of saying the statement "I am asleep" without it being false. It
   is true that somebody could talk in his sleep and incidentally say "I
   am asleep" but he could not assert that he is asleep. If he is actually
   asleep then he is not aware of saying the statement (and so it is not
   an assertion), whilst if he is aware of saying the statement then he is
   not asleep. Since a sleeping individual cannot meaningfully assert that
   he is asleep, Malcolm concludes that communication between a sleeping
   individual and individuals who are awake is logically impossible.

   As inherently first personal and retrospective reports, or so Malcolm
   alleges, the dream report fails Wittgensteinian criteria of being
   potentially verified as experiences. Malcolm alleges that there could
   be no intelligible mental state that could occur during sleep; any talk
   about mental states that could occur during sleep is meaningless.
   Malcolm assumes the Wittgensteinian point that talk about experiences
   gain meaning in virtue of their communicability. Communicability is
   necessary for the meaningfulness of folk psychological terms. Malcolm
   appeals to the "no private language argument" to rebut the idea that
   there could be a mental state which only one individual could privately
   experience and understand (for more on the private language argument,
   see Candlish & Wrisley, 2012).

   The claim that there is a lack of possible communicability in sleep is
   key for Malcolm to cash out the further claim that one cannot make
   judgements during sleep. He does not believe that one could judge what
   they cannot communicate. According to Malcolm, since people cannot
   communicate during sleep, they cannot make judgements during sleep. He
   further adds that being unable to judge that one is asleep underlies
   the impossibility of being unable to have any mental experience during
   sleep. For, we could never observe an individual judge that he was
   asleep. This point relies on Malcolm's second argument that the
   definitions of sleep and dreaming are in contradiction. There is
   nothing an individual could do to demonstrate he was making a judgement
   that did not also simultaneously show that he was awake. Of course, it
   seems possible that we could have an inner experience that we did not
   communicate to others. Malcolm points out that individuals in everyday
   waking instances could have communicated their experiences, at least
   modally. There is no possible world though, in which a sleeping
   individual could communicate with us his experience - so one cannot
   judge that one is asleep and dreaming. If Malcolm's argument about the
   impossibility of making judgements in sleep works then his attack is
   detrimental to the received view's premise that in sleep we can judge,
   reason, and so forth.

iv. Ramifications (contra Descartes)

   Malcolm thinks that his challenge to the received view, if successful,
   undercuts Cartesian scepticism Descartes' scepticism got off the ground
   when he raised the following issue: due to the similarity of dreams and
   waking experiences, my apparent waking experience might be a dream now
   and much of what I took to be knowledge is potentially untrue. A key
   premise for Descartes is that a dream is a sequence of experiences, the
   very same kind we can have whilst awake. This premise is undermined if
   dreams are not experiences at all. If the received view is
   unintelligible then Descartes cannot coherently compare waking life
   experiences to dreams: "if one cannot have thoughts while sound asleep,
   one cannot be deceived while sound asleep" (Malcolm: 1956, p.22).
   Descartes, championing the received view, failed to notice the
   incoherence in the notion that we can be asleep and aware of anything.
   Whenever we are aware of anything, whether it be the fire in front of
   us or otherwise, this is firm evidence that we are awake and that the
   world presented to us is as it really is.

c. Possible Objections to Malcolm

i. Putnam on the Conceptual Analysis of Dreaming

   Part of Malcolm's challenge to empirical work was his claim that the
   researchers have invoked new conceptions of sleep and dreaming (without
   realizing it) because of the new method of attempted verification.
   According to Malcolm's charge, researchers are not really looking into
   dreaming as the received view understands the concept of dreaming. This
   was crucial for his attempt to undermine all empirical work on
   dreaming. Instead of relying on an individual's waking report
   scientists may now try to infer from rapid eye movements or other
   physiological criteria that the individual is asleep and dreaming. For
   Malcolm, these scientists are working from a new conception of "sleep"
   and "dreaming" which only resembles the old one. Putnam objects to
   Malcolm's claim, stating that science updates our concepts and does not
   replace them: the received view seeks confirmation in empirical work.
   In general, concepts are always being updated by new empirical
   knowledge. Putnam cites the example of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), a
   disease which is made very difficult to diagnose because the symptoms
   resemble those of other neurological diseases and not all of the
   symptoms are usually present. Furthermore, some neurologists have come
   to believe that MS is caused by a certain virus. Suppose a patient has
   a paradigmatic case of MS. Saying that the virus is the cause of the
   disease changes the concept because it involves new knowledge. On
   Malcolm's general account, it would be a new understanding with a new
   concept and so the scientists would not be talking about MS at all
   (Putnam, 1962: p.219). Putnam believes that we should reject Malcolm's
   view that future scientists are talking about a different disease.
   Analogously, we are still talking about the same thing when we talk
   about new ways of verifying the existence of dreams. If Putnam's attack
   is successful then the work that scientists are doing on dreaming is
   about dreaming as the received view understands the concept, namely,
   conscious experiences that occur during sleep. If Putnam is right that
   scientists are not invoking a new conception of sleep and dreaming,
   then we can find other ways to verify our understanding of dreaming and
   the received view is continuous with empirical work.

ii. Distinguishing "State" and "Creature" Consciousness

   David Rosenthal develops some conceptual vocabulary (Rosenthal: 2002,
   p.406), which arguably exposes a flaw in Malcolm's reasoning. "Creature
   consciousness" is what any individual or animal displays when awake and
   responsive to external stimuli. "Creature unconsciousness" is what the
   individual or animal displays when unresponsive to external stimuli.
   "State consciousness," on the other hand, refers to the mental state
   that occurs when one has an experience. This may be either internally
   or externally driven. I may have a perception of my environment or an
   imaginative idea without perceptual input. Malcolm evidently thinks
   that any form of state consciousness requires some degree of creature
   consciousness. But such a belief begs the question, so a Rosenthalian
   opponent of Malcolm might argue. It does not seem to be conceptually
   confused to believe that one can be responsive to internal stimuli
   (hence state conscious) without being responsive to external stimuli
   (hence creature unconscious). If, by "sleep" all we have meant is
   creature unconsciousness, then there is no reason to believe that an
   individual cannot have state conscious at the same time. An individual
   can be creature unconscious whilst having state consciousness, that is
   to say, an individual can be asleep and dreaming.

   There are various reasons to believe that creature consciousness and
   state consciousness can come apart (and that state consciousness can
   plausibly occur without creature consciousness): the mental experience
   of dreaming can be gripping and the individual's critical reasoning
   poor enough to be deceived into believing his dream is reality; most
   movement in sleep is not a response to outside stimuli at all but
   rather a response to internal phenomenology; the sleeping individual is
   never directly aware of his own body during sleep. Recall that Malcolm
   thought that sleep scientists cannot correlate movement in sleep with a
   later dream report because it detracted from their being fully asleep
   because creature consciousness and state consciousness can coexist.
   Malcolm is arguably wrong, then, to think that an individual moving in
   sleep detracts from their being fully asleep. This may block Malcolm's
   appeal to sound sleep as the paradigmatic example of sleep. With the
   Rosenthalian distinction, we have reason to believe that even if an
   individual moves around in sleep, they are just as asleep as a sleeping
   individual lying completely still. The distinction may also count
   against Malcolm's third argument against the possibility of
   communication in sleep. Of course, if creature consciousness is a
   necessary condition for communication then this distinction is not
   enough to undermine Malcolm's third argument that communication cannot
   occur during sleep. A view where state consciousness alone suffices for
   communication will survive Malcolm's third argument, on the other hand.

   The apparent contradiction in sleep and dreaming that Malcolm claims
   existed will be avoided if the kind of consciousness implied by sleep
   is different to the kind Malcolm thinks is implied. The distinction
   might allow us to conclude that corroboration between a waking report
   and a publically verifiable sound, for example, can demonstrate that an
   individual is dreaming and yet asleep. Some dream content, as reported
   afterwards, seems to incorporate external stimuli that occurred at the
   same time as the dream. Malcolm calls this faint perception (Malcolm,
   1956: p.22) of the environment and says that it detracts from an
   individual's being fully asleep. Perhaps an objector to Malcolm can
   make a further, albeit controversial claim, in the Rosenthalian
   framework, to account for such dreams. For example, if there is thunder
   outside and an individual is asleep he might dream of being struck by
   Thor's hammer. His experience of the thunder is not the same sort of
   experience he would have had if he were awake during the thunder. The
   possible qualia are different. So Malcolm may be wrong in alleging that
   an individual is faintly aware of the outside environment if
   corroboration is attempted between a report and a verifiable sound, for
   example. Malcolm argued that such dreams are examples of individuals
   who are not fully asleep. But we can now see within the Rosenthalian
   framework how an individual could be creature unconscious (or simply
   "asleep" on the received view) and be taking in external stimuli
   unconsciously whilst having state consciousness that is not directly
   responsive to the external environment because he is not even faintly
   conscious of the external world.

   See Nagel (1959), Yost (1959), Ayer (1960; 1961), Pears (1961), Kramer
   (1962) and Chappell (1963), for other replies to Malcolm.

d. Dennett's Challenge to the Received View

i. A New Model of Dreaming: Uploading Unconscious Content

   Dennett begins his attack on the received view of dreaming (the set of
   claims about dreams being consciously experienced during sleep) by
   questioning its authority. He does this by proposing a new model of
   dreaming. He is flexible in his approach and considers variations of
   his model. The crucial difference between his theory and the received
   view is that consciousness is not present during sleep on, what we
   might call Dennett's uploading of unconscious content model of
   dreaming. Dennett does not say much about how this processing of
   unconscious material works, only that different memories are uploaded
   and woven together to create new content that will be recalled upon
   waking as though it was experienced during sleep, although it never
   was. Dennett is not repeating Malcolm's first argument that dreaming is
   unverifiable. On the contrary, he believes that the issue will be
   settled empirically, though he claims that there is nothing to favour
   the received view's own claim that dreams involve conscious
   experiences.

   On the received view, the memory of an earlier dream is caused by the
   earlier dream experience and is the second time the content is
   experienced. On Dennett's model, dream recall is the first time the
   content is experienced. Why believe that dreaming involves a lack of
   consciousness during sleep? One might cite evidence that the directions
   of rapid eye movements during sleep have been well correlated with the
   reports of dream content. An individual with predominantly horizontal
   eye movements might wake up and report that they were watching a tennis
   match in their dream. Dennett accommodates these (at the time)
   unconfirmed findings by arguing that even if it is the case that eye
   movement matches perfectly with the reported content, the unconscious
   is uploading memories and readying the content that will be experienced
   in the form of a false memory. The memory loading process is not
   conscious at the time of occurrence. Such findings would almost return
   us back to the received view - that the content of the dream does occur
   during sleep. It may be that the unconscious content is uploaded
   sequentially in the same order as the received view believes. We do not
   have proof that the individual is aware of the content of the dream
   during sleep. That is to say, the individual may not be having a
   conscious experience, even though the brain process involves the
   scenario which will be consciously experienced later, as though it was
   consciously experienced during sleep. Movement and apparent emotion in
   sleep can be accounted for too; a person twitches in their sleep as a
   memory with content involving a frightening scenario is uploaded and
   interwoven into a nightmarish narrative. It does not necessarily follow
   that the individual is conscious of this content being uploaded. This
   account is even plausible on an evolutionary account of sleep. The mind
   needs time to be unconscious and the brain and body needs to
   recalibrate. Thus, during sleep, the body is like a puppet, its strings
   being pulled by the memory loading process - although individuals show
   outward sign of emotion and bodily movement, there is nothing going on
   inside. Sometimes, though, what is remembered is the content being
   prepared, similar to the received view, only the individual is not
   aware of the content during sleep - this is why there can be matches
   between dream content reported and the direction of eye movement. Both
   sides of the debate agree that when dream content is being prepared
   some parts of the body move about as though it was a conscious
   experience, only Dennett denies that consciousness is present at the
   time and the received view believes that it is present.

   Dennett also considers possibilities where the content of dream recall
   does not match the content that is uploaded. The content of the
   uploading during sleep might involve, say, window shopping in a local
   mall, yet the content that is recalled upon waking might recall flying
   over Paris. Having outlined the two theories - the received view and
   his own unconscious alternative - Dennett is merely making a sceptical
   point that the data of dream reports alone will not decide between
   them. What is to choose between them? Dennett believes that there is
   further evidence of a specific type of dream report that might decide
   the issue in favour of his own model.

ii. Accounting for New Data on Dreams: "Precognitive" Dreams

   Any scientific theory must be able to account for all of the data.
   Dennett believes that there exists certain dream reports which the
   received view has failed to acknowledge and cannot account for. There
   exists anecdotal evidence that seems to suggest that dreams are
   concocted at the moment of waking, rather than experienced during sleep
   and is therefore a direct challenge to the received view. The most
   well-known anecdotal example was noted by French physicist Alfred
   Maury, who dreamt for some time of taking part in the French
   Revolution, before being forcibly taken to the Guillotine. As his head
   was about to be cut off in the dream, he woke up with the headboard
   falling on his neck (Freud, 1900: Chapter 1; Blackmore, 2005: p. 103).
   This anecdotal type of dream is well documented in films - one dreams
   of taking a long romantic vacation with a significant other, about to
   kiss them, only to wake up with the dog licking their face. In
   Dennett's own anecdotal example, he recalls dreaming for some time of
   looking for his neighbour's goat. Eventually, the goat started bleating
   at the same time as his alarm clock went off which then woke him up
   (Dennett: 1976, p.157). The received view is committed to the claim
   that dreams, that is, conscious experiences, occur whilst an individual
   is asleep. The individual then awakes with the preserved memory of
   content from the dream. But the anecdotes pose a potentially fatal
   problem for the received view because the entire content of the dream
   seems to be caused by the stimulus that woke the individual up. The
   anecdotes make dreams look more like spontaneous imaginings on waking
   than the real time conscious experiences of the received view. Dennett
   argues that precognition is the only defense the received view can take
   against this implication. Given the paranormal connotations, this
   defense is redundant (Dennett: 1976, p. 158). Dennett provides a number
   of other anecdotal examples that imply that the narrative to dreams is
   triggered retrospectively, after waking. The content of the dream
   thematically and logically leads up to the end point, which is too
   similar to the waking stimulus to be a coincidence. The difficulty for
   the received view is to explain how the content could be working
   towards simultaneously ending with the sound, or equivalent experience,
   of something in the outside environment. Figures 2 and 3 depict the
   attempts to explain the new data on the received view and Dennett's
   model.


   Fig 2



   Fig 3

   If Dennett is right that the received view can only explain the
   anecdotes by appeal to precognition then we would do well to adopt a
   more plausible account of dreaming. Any attempt to suggest that
   individuals have premonitions about the near future from dreams would
   have little credibility. Dennett's alternative unconscious uploading
   account might also allow for the retro-selection of appropriate content
   on the moment of waking. This theory allows for two ways of dreaming to
   regularly occur, both without conscious experience during sleep. The
   first way: dreams play out similar to the received view, only
   individuals lack consciousness of the content during sleep.
   Specifically, Dennett argues that during sleep different memories are
   uploaded by the unconscious and woven together to create the dream
   content that will eventually be experienced when the individual wakes.
   During sleep the content of the dream is gathered together by the
   brain, without conscious awareness, like recording a programme at night
   which is consciously played for the first time in waking moments. The
   second way: perhaps when one is woken up dramatically, the brain
   selects material (relevant to the nature of the waking stimulus) at the
   moment of waking which is threaded together as a new story, causing the
   individual to have a "hallucination of recollection" (Dennett, 1976:
   p.169). It might be that the unconscious was preparing entirely
   different content during sleep, which was set to be recalled, but that
   content is overwritten due to the dramatic interruption.

   On Dennett's unconscious uploading/retro-selection theory, "it is not
   like anything to dream, although it is like something to have dreamed"
   (Dennett, 1976: p.161). Consciousness is invoked on waking as one
   apparently remembers an event which had never consciously occurred
   before. On the above proposal, Dennett was not experiencing A - G, nor
   was the content for that dream even being prepared (though it might
   have been material prepared at an earlier date and selected now).
   Dennett also alludes to a library in the brain of undreamed dreams with
   various endings that are selected in the moments of waking to
   appropriately fit the narrative connotations of the stimuli that wakes
   the individual (Dennett, 1976: p. 158). His account is open to include
   variations of his model: perhaps various different endings might be
   selected - instead of a goat, other content may have competed for
   uploading through association - it may have been a dream involving
   going to the barbers and getting a haircut, before the buzzing of the
   clippers coincided with the alarm clock, or boarding a spaceship before
   it took off, had the sound of the alarm clock been more readily
   associated with these themes. Alternatively, the same ending might get
   fixed with alternative story-lines leading up to that ending. Dennett
   could have had a dream about going to his local job centre and being
   employed as a farmer, rather than searching for his neighbour's goat,
   though the same ending of finding a bleating goat will stay in place.

   As Dennett notes, if any of these possibilities turn out to be true
   then the received view is false and so they are serious rivals indeed.
   For all the evidence we have (in 1976), Dennett believes his
   unconscious uploading model is better placed to explain the data than
   the received view because the anecdotes prove that sometimes the
   conscious experience only occurs after sleep - an alien idea to the
   received view. Moreover, the received view should have no immediate
   advantage over the other models. Dennett separates the memory from the
   experience - the memory of a dream is first experienced consciously
   when it is recalled. The result is the same as Malcolm's - the received
   view is epistemologically and metaphysically flawed. If there is
   nothing it is like to have a dream during sleep, then the recall of
   dreams does not refer to any experience that occurred during sleep.

e. Possible Objections to Dennett

i. Lucid Dreaming

   It might seem that lucid dreaming is an immediate objection to Malcolm
   and Dennett's arguments against the received view. Lucid dreaming
   occurs when an individual is aware during a dream that it is a dream.
   Lucid dreaming is therefore an example of experiencing a dream whilst
   one is asleep, therefore dreams must be experiences that occur during
   sleep. In replying to this objection, Dennett argues that lucid
   dreaming does not really occur. For, the waking impression might
   contain "the literary conceit of a dream within a dream" (Dennett:
   1976, p.161). The recalled dream might just have content where it seems
   as though the individual is aware they are having a dream. Even this
   content might have been uploaded unconsciously during sleep. It might
   now seem that we have no obvious way of testing that the individual who
   reports having had a lucid dream is aware of the dream at the time.
   Dennett's reply is undermined by a series of experiments carried out by
   Stephen LaBerge. LaBerge asked individuals who could lucid dream to
   voluntarily communicate with him in their lucid dreams by using the
   match in content of the dream to the direction of eye movements,
   thereby challenging Dennett's claim that individuals are not conscious
   during sleep. The participants made pre-arranged and agreed eye
   movements. One might think that if lucid dreaming is really occurring,
   and the direction of REM might be linked to the content of the dream as
   it occurs, then one could pre-arrange some way of looking around in a
   lucid dream (that stands out from random eye movement) in order to test
   both theories. Stephen LaBerge carried out this experiment with
   positive results (LaBerge, 1990). The meaning of certain patterns of
   intended and previously arranged eye movement, for example,
   left-right-left-right can be a sleeping individual's way of expressing
   the fact that they are having a dream and aware that they are having a
   dream (see figure below).


   Fig 4


   In figure 4 above, the graph correlates with the reported dream
   content. The participant wakes and gives a dream report which matches
   the eye movement. The participant claims to have made five eye signals
   as agreed. The written report confirms the eye movements and the
   participant is not shown any of the physiological data until his report
   is given. He alleges to have gained lucidity in the first eye movement
   (1, LRLR). He then flew about in his dream, until 2, where he signalled
   that he thought he had awakened (2, LRx4). 2 is a false awakening which
   he then realized and went on to signal lucidity once again in 3. Here,
   he made too many eye signals and went on to correct this. This
   corroborates with the participant's report. The participant accurately
   signals in the fifth set of eye movements that he is awake which
   coincides with the other physiological data that the participant is
   awake (participants were instructed to keep their eyes closed when they
   thought they had awoken).

   The important implication of LaBerge's experiment for Malcolm and
   Dennett's arguments is that they can no longer dismiss the results of
   content matching with eye movement as merely "apparent" or "occasional"
   (as they took the content-relative-to-eye-movement claim at the time
   they wrote). Predictability is a hallmark of good science and these
   findings indicate that sleep science can achieve such status. The
   content-relativity thesis is confirmed by the findings because it is
   exactly what that thesis predicts in LaBerge's experiment. The opposing
   thesis - that eye movement is not relative to content, cannot explain
   why the predicted result occurred. Namely, if we believe that eye
   content might match the content of the dream (and that lucid dreaming
   really can occur, contra Dennett), then if sleep scientists asked
   participants to do something in their dream (upon onset of lucidity)
   that would show that they are aware - this is what we would expect.

   The received view gains further confirmation because in order to make
   sense of the communication as communication, one has to employ the
   notion that the direction of eye movement was being voluntarily
   expressed. If one is convinced by LaBerge's arguments, then the notion
   of communicating during sleep undercuts Malcolm's privilege of the
   dream report and his claim that individuals could never communicate
   during sleep. We can empirically demonstrate, then, that the waking
   impression and the dream itself are logically separable. We need an
   account of why a sleeping individual would be exhibiting such
   systematic eye movements in LaBerge's experiments. One reasonable
   conclusion is that the participant is mentally alert (has state
   consciousness) even though they are not awake (are not displaying
   creature consciousness). The most important implication of LaBerge's
   study is that communication can arguably occur from within the dream
   without waking the individual up in any way. This supports the claim of
   the received view that we can be asleep and yet having a sequence of
   conscious experiences at the same time. The content of the dream occurs
   during sleep because the content is matched to the expected, systematic
   eye movement beyond coincidence. The systematic eye movement occurs
   exactly as predicted on the received view. Although Dennett could
   account for matched content to eye movement - he could not account for
   what seems like voluntary communication, which requires that an
   individual is conscious. This arguably leaves us in a position to cash
   out dreaming experience as verifiable as any other waking state.

   The "content relative to eye movement" thesis can be accepted
   uncontroversially. Much dream content really does occur during sleep
   and this can be taken advantage of via participants communicating and
   thereby demonstrating conscious awareness. If LaBerge's participants
   communicating with sleep scientists convinces, then the received view
   is right to think that the content of dreams does occur during sleep
   and that the dream content during sleep matches the memory of dream
   content. The findings are significant insofar as the participants
   influenced the dream content and thereby influenced eye movement
   through an act of agency within the dream.

   The most important potential implication of LaBerge's findings, though
   the more controversial implication, is that communication can occur
   from within the dream without the individual waking up in any way,
   thereby confirming the received view. The content of the dream occurs
   during sleep because the study confirms that eye movement during sleep
   really does match up with the content of the dream as reported after
   sleep. LaBerge chose agreed eye movements rather than speech, because
   in this way, the individual would remain asleep. The experiment also
   challenges Malcolm's claim that dreams cannot be communicated and were
   therefore logically unverifiable.

   There exists a possible objection to the received view cashing in the
   results from LaBerge's experiments, which can be raised in line with
   Dennett's unconscious memory-loading process. The objector might argue
   that the unconscious takes care of the pending task of looking around
   in the dream in the pre-arranged manner. If, according to Dennett's
   retro-selection model, the unconscious uploads memories from the day,
   then it follows that one of the memories it might upload could be of
   the participant discussing with LaBerge the specific eye movements to
   be made. So the unconscious might carry out the eye movements,
   misleading scientists into believing the sleeping individual is
   conscious. Once we start to credit the unconscious with being able to
   negotiate with waking memories during sleep and to make judgements, we
   either have to change our picture of the unconscious or conclude that
   these individuals are consciously aware during sleep.

   LaBerge carried out a further experiment in which the timing of dreams
   was measured from within the dream. The experiment used lucid dreamers
   again who made the agreed signal. They then counted to 10 in their
   dream and then made the eye signal again. They were also asked to
   estimate the passing of 10 seconds without counting (see fig. 5 below).
   LaBerge has concluded from his experiments that experience in dreams
   happens roughly at the same time as in waking life. This second
   experiment carried out by LaBerge further blunts the Dennettian
   objection from unconsciously uploading the task. For, it seems to
   require agency (rather than unconscious processing) to negotiate how
   much time is passing before carrying out an action.

   Fig 5

   There is still room for scepticism towards dreams being consciously
   experienced during sleep. For, the sceptic could bite the bullet and
   say that lucid dreams are a special, anomalous case that does not apply
   to ordinary dreaming. Indeed, there is evidence that different parts of
   the brain are accessed, or more strongly activated, during lucid
   dreaming (pre-frontal brain regions, pre-cuneus and front polar
   regions). So there still remains the possibility that lucid dreaming is
   an example of consciously "waking up within a dream" whilst ordinary
   dreams are taken care of entirely by the unconscious (thus there is not
   anything-it's-like to have an ordinary dream occur during sleep). It
   might be useful to look at one report of the memory of a lucid dream:

   In a dangerous part of San Francisco, for some reason I start crawling
   on the sidewalk. I start
   to reflect: this is strange; why can't I walk? Can other people walk
   upright here? Is it just me
   who has to crawl? I see a man in a suit walking under the streetlight.
   Now my curiosity is
   replaced by fear. I think, crawling around like this may be interesting
   but it is not safe. Then I
   think, I never do this - I always walk around San Francisco upright!
   This only happens in
   dreams. Finally, it dawns on me: I must be dreaming! (LaBerge &
   Rheingold, 1990: p.35)

   Notice that this is not just the memory-report of a lucid dream.
   Rather, it is the memory-report of an ordinary dream turning into a
   lucid dream. The report demonstrates an epistemic transition within the
   dream. With this in mind, it is difficult to maintain that lucid dreams
   are anomalous, or that lucid dreams bring about conscious experience.
   For, there is a gradual process of realization. We might want to also
   thus accept that the preceding ordinary dream is conscious too because
   whenever individuals gain lucidity in their dreams, there is a prior
   process of gradual realization that is present in the dream report.
   When an individual acquires lucidity in a dream, they are arguably
   already conscious but they begin to think more critically, as the above
   example demonstrates. Different parts of the brain are activated during
   lucidity, but these areas do not implicate consciousness. Rather, they
   are better correlated to the individual thinking more critically.

   The gradual transition from ordinary dream to lucid dream can be more
   fully emphasized. It is possible to question oneself in a dream whilst
   failing to provide the right answer. One might disbelieve that one is
   awake and ask another dream character to hit oneself, apparently feel
   pain and so conclude that one is awake. It is important here to
   highlight the existence of partial-lucid dreams in order to show that
   dreams often involve irrationality and that there are fine-grained
   transitions to the fuller lucidity of critical thinking in dreams. A
   lucid dream, unlike ordinary dreams, is defined strictly in terms of
   the advanced epistemic status of the dreamer - the individual is having
   a lucid dream if they are aware that he or she is dreaming (Green,
   1968: p.15). Lucid dreaming is defined in the weak sense as awareness
   that one is dreaming. Defined more strongly, lucid dreams involve
   controllability and a level of clarity akin to waking life. As stated,
   individuals can come close to realizing they are dreaming and miss out
   - they might dream about the nature of dreaming or lucid dreaming
   without realizing that they are currently in a dream themselves. Hence
   the norms of logical inference do not apply to ordinary dreams. One
   might look around in one's dream and think "I must remember the people
   in this dream for my dream journal" without inferring that one is in a
   dream and acquiring lucidity. In another dream an individual might
   intend to tell another person in real life, who is featured in the
   dream, something they have learned just as soon as they wake up. In a
   dream, the dreamer could be accused by dream character Y of carrying
   out an action A - the dreamer thinks "I must wake up to tell Y that I
   did not carry out this action." Implicitly, the dreamer knows it is a
   dream to make sense of the belief that they need to wake up, but they
   have not realized that Y will not have a continuation of the beliefs of
   their dream representative. The dream here involves awareness of the
   dream state without controllability over the dream (for they still seem
   to be going along with the content as though it were real). There is
   another type of common, partial-lucid dream in which people wake up
   from a dream and are able to return to it upon sleeping and change the
   course of the dream. This type of dream seems to involve
   controllability without awareness - they treat it as real and do not
   treat it as an acknowledged dream but are able to have much more
   control over the content than usual. Lucid dreamers used in
   experimental settings are much more experienced and have lucid dreams
   in the strongest sense - they are aware they are dreaming (and can
   maintain this awareness for a significant duration of time), have
   control over the content and have a level of clarity of thinking akin
   to waking life.

   There are a number of further implications of LaBerge's findings for
   various philosophical claims. The existence of communication during
   lucid dreaming challenges Augustine's idea that dreams are not actions.
   If we can gain the same level of agency we have in waking life during
   lucid dreaming, then it might be the case that even ordinary dreams
   carry some, albeit reduced, form of agency. We might want to believe
   this new claim if we accept that agency is not suddenly invoked during
   lucidity, but is rather enhanced. The findings also open up the
   possibility to test the claim that somebody who is dreaming cannot tell
   that they are not awake, further undermining Descartes' claim that
   dreaming and waking experiences are inherently indistinguishable.
   Previously, philosophers who wanted to resist the sceptical argument
   would say that someone who is dreaming might be able unable to
   distinguish the state they were in but not that someone awake is unable
   to distinguish, for example, Locke's point that if we are in pain then
   we must be in an awake state. Had Descartes been a lucid dreamer, then
   when he was sat by the fire, his phrase might have come out as "I am
   now seated by the fire but I have also been deceived in dreams into
   believing I have been seated by the fire ... though on occasion I have
   realized that I was just dreaming when apparently seated by the fire
   and so was not deceived at all!" It is surely a contingent fact that
   people rarely have lucid dreams. If people lucidly dreamt much more
   often, then Descartes' sceptical dream argument would have had little
   to motivate it. Work on communicative lucid dreaming might also open up
   the possibility to test further phenomenally distinguishing features
   between the two states via individuals communicating statements about
   these features.

ii. Alternative Explanations for "Precognitive" Dreams

   Dennett had cited an interesting type of dream report where the ending
   of the dream was strongly implied by the stimulus of awakening. For
   example: having a dream of getting married end with the sound of church
   bells ringing, which coincides with the sound of the alarm clock. These
   seemingly precognitive dreams are sometimes referred to in the
   literature as "the anecdotes" because of their generally
   non-experimental form. Though they are remote from scientific
   investigation, the mere existence of the anecdotes at all caused
   trouble for the received view and requires explanation. They provide
   extra evidence for Dennett's proposed paradigm shift of dreaming. On
   the other hand, if there is enough evidence to claim that dreams are
   consciously experienced during sleep then the anecdotal data of dreams
   will not be a powerful enough counterexample; they will not warrant a
   paradigm shift in our thinking about dreams. The biggest challenge the
   anecdotes represent is that on occasion the memory can significantly
   deviate from the actual experience. On this view, false memories
   overriding the actual content of the dream does occur, but these
   experiences are the exception rather than the rule.

   Though LaBerge's experiments suggest that the content of dreams
   consciously occurs during sleep, the findings on their own are
   insufficient to draw the conclusion that all dreams occur during sleep.
   The existence of the anecdotes blocks one from drawing that conclusion.
   But these anecdotes can be explained on the received view. It is
   already known that the human species has specific bodily rhythms for
   sleep. Further, there is a noted phenomenon that people wake up at the
   same time even when their alarm clocks are off. Dennett himself says
   that he had got out his old alarm clock that he had not used in months
   and set the alarm himself (Dennett, 1976: p.157) - presumably for a
   time he usually gets up at anyway. If the subconscious can be credited
   with either creating a dream world on the received view or a dream
   memory on the Dennettian view and the personal body clock works with
   some degree of automaticity during sleep, one may well ask why the
   dream's anticipation (and symbolic representation) of this need be
   precognitive in a paranormal sense. Had Dennett woken up earlier, he
   may have lain in bed realizing that his alarm clock was going to go
   off, which is not considered an act of precognition. Had he thought
   this during sleep, the received view would expect it to be covered
   symbolically via associative imagery. Thus, perhaps Dennett is not
   being impartial in his treatment of dreams, and his argument begs the
   question since he is considering the received view's version of
   dreaming to be inferior to his own theory by assuming that thought in
   dreaming is completely oblivious to the banalities of the future.

   Arguably, the other anecdotes can be explained away. Recall the most
   famous anecdote, where Maury was dragged to the guillotine with the
   headboard falling on his neck, waking him up (Freud discusses the case
   of Maury in the first chapter of his Interpretation of Dreams). Maury
   may have had some ongoing and subconscious awareness of the wobbliness
   of his headboard before it fell (presumably it did not fall without
   movement on his part - possibly in resistance to being beheaded.
   Maury's could thus be a type of dreaming involving self-fulfilling
   prophecy) that is left out of the overall account. Dennett's account
   agrees that any unconscious awareness of the outside environment is
   represented differently in the dream. Maury would have had enough time
   to form the simple association of his headboard being like a guillotine
   from the French Revolution. If he had some awareness of the looseness
   of his headboard, then the thought: "if this headboard falls on me it
   will be like being beheaded," would be appropriately synchronized into
   the dream.

   Though it is possible to provide alternative explanation for some of
   the anecdotes, it might be worth dividing Dennett's anecdotes into hard
   and soft anecdotes. A hard anecdote is outlined by Dennett: a car
   backfires outside and an individual wakes up with the memory of a dream
   logically leading up to being shot. The soft anecdotes, those already
   mentioned (such as Maury's and Dennett's own examples), can at least be
   alternatively explained. The hard anecdotes, on the other hand, cannot
   simply be explained by appeal to body clocks and anticipation in sleep.
   The hard anecdotes reveal that the dreamer has no idea what will wake
   them up in the morning, if anything (maybe the alarm will not actually
   go off; or the truck backfiring could occur at any point). The soft
   anecdotes might involve outside stimuli being unconsciously
   incorporated into the dream. The only hard anecdote mentioned in
   Dennett's paper is made up by Dennett himself to outline his theory,
   rather than representing a genuine example of a dream. Notice that a
   hard anecdote could favour the received view - if experimenters
   switched off an alarm that a participant had set and that individual
   woke with a dream which seemed to anticipate the alarm going off at the
   set time (for example, had Dennett's goat dream occurred despite his
   alarm not going off) then we might do best to conclude that the dream
   consciously occurred during sleep in a sequential order leading up to
   the awakening. Dennett is right that the issue is worth empirically
   investigating. If a survey found that hard anecdote-like dreams (such
   as a truck back-firing and waking with a dream thematically similar)
   occur often, then the received view is either dis-confirmed or must
   find a way to make room for such dreams.

   Dennett might reply that he does not need to wait for the empirical
   evidence to reveal that the hard anecdotes are common. He might simply
   deny that the alternative explanation of the soft anecdotes is not
   credible. If the attempt to explain the soft anecdotes are not credible
   (as a Dennettian might object), they at least draw attention to the
   extraneous variables in each of the anecdotes. Dennett's sole reason
   for preferring his retro-selection theory over the received view is so
   an explanation can account for the anecdotal data. But Dennett uses his
   own alarm clock which he himself set the night before; Maury uses his
   own bed; Dennett of course admits that the evidence is anecdotal and
   not experimental. In one of the few actual experiments carried out,
   water is slowly dripped onto a sleeping participant's back to wake them
   up, but this is not timed and is akin to a soft anecdote. More
   empirical work needs to be done to clarify the issue and for the debate
   to move forward.

   The anecdotes are a specific subclass of prophetic dreams. It is worth
   noting a related issue about dreams which are alleged to have a more
   prophetic nature. It seems from the subjective point of view that if
   one was to have had a dream about a plane crash the night before (or
   morning of) September 11^th 2001 this would have been a premonitory
   dream. Or one might dream of a relative or celebrity dying and then
   wake to find this actually happens in real life. The probability of the
   occurrence of a dream being loosely (or even exactly) about an
   unforeseen, future event is increased when one has a whole lifetime of
   dreams - a lifetime to generate one or two coincidences. The dreams
   which are not premonitory are under-reported and the apparently
   prophetic dreams are over-reported. The probability of having a dream
   with content vaguely similar to the future is increased by the fact
   that a single individual has many dreams over a lifetime. Big events
   are witnessed and acknowledged by large numbers of people which
   increases the probability that someone will have a dream with similar
   content (Dawkins, 1998: p.158). No doubt when the twin towers were
   attacked some people just so happened to have dreams about plane
   crashes, and a few might have even had dreams more or less related to
   planes crashing into towers, or even the Twin Towers. Billions of
   dreams would have been generated the night prior, as they are every
   night around the world, and so some would have invariably "hit the
   mark." Dennett's anecdotes are somewhat different, but they too may
   have the same problem of being over-reported in this way. At the same
   time, they may also suffer from being under-reported because they are
   not always obviously related to the stimulus of awakening, particularly
   where someone pays attention to the content of the dream and forgets
   how they awakened. Hence, the extent to which we experience
   anecdote-like dreams is currently uncertain, though they can be
   explained on the received view.

4. The Function of Dreaming

   The function of dreaming - exactly why we dream and what purpose it
   could fulfil in helping us to survive and reproduce - is explained in
   evolutionary terms of natural selection. Natural selection is best
   understood as operating through three principles: Variation, Heredity
   and Selection. A group of living creatures within a species vary from
   one another in their traits, their traits are passed on to their own
   offspring, and there is competition for survival and reproduction
   amongst all of these creatures. The result is that those creatures that
   have traits better suited for surviving and reproducing will be
   precisely the creatures to survive, reproduce and pass on the
   successful traits. Most traits of any organism are implicated in
   helping it to survive and thereby typically serve some purpose.
   Although the question of what dreaming might do for us has to this day
   remained a mystery, there has never been a shortage of proposed
   theories. The most sustained first attempt to account for why we dream
   comes from Freud (1900), whose theory was countered by his friend and
   later adversary Carl Jung. An outline of these two early approaches
   will be followed by a leading theory in philosophical and
   neuro-biological literature: that dreaming is an evolutionary
   by-product. On this view, dreaming has no function but comes as a side
   effect of other useful traits, namely, cognition and sleep. A
   contemporary theory opposing the view that dreaming has no function, in
   comparison, holds that dreaming is a highly advantageous state where
   the content of the dream aids an organism in later waking behaviour
   that is survival-enhancing by rehearsing the perception and avoidance
   of threat.

a. Early Approaches

i. Freud: Psychoanalysis

   The psychoanalytic approach, initiated by Freud, gives high esteem to
   dreams as a key source of insight into, and the main method of opening
   up, the unconscious (Freud, 1900: §VII, E, p.381). Psychoanalysis is a
   type of therapy aimed at helping people overcome mental problems.
   Therapy often involves in depth analyses of patient's dreams. In order
   to analyse dreams though, Freudian psychoanalysis is committed to an
   assumption that dreams are fulfilling a certain function. Freud
   explicitly put forward a theory of the function of dreams. He believed
   that dreams have not been culturally generated by humans, as Malcolm
   thought, but are rather a mental activity that our ancestors also
   experienced. During sleep, the mind is disconnected from the external
   world but remains instinctual. The psychoanalytic take on dreaming is
   better understood in terms of Freud's overall picture of the mind,
   which he split into id, ego and super-ego. The id is an entirely
   unconscious part of the mind, something we cannot gain control of, but
   is rather only systematically suppressed. It is present at birth, does
   not understand the differences between opposites and seeks to satisfy
   its continually generated libidinal instinctual impulses (Storr, 1989:
   p.61). The id precedes any sense of self, is chaotic, aggressive,
   unorganised, produces no collective will and is incapable of making
   value judgements As the child develops and grows up his instinctual
   needs as a baby are repressed and covered up (Storr, 1989: p.63). If
   humans were guided only by the id they would behave like babies, trying
   to fulfil their every need instantly, without being able to wait; the
   id has no conception of time. It is the id that will get an individual
   into social trouble. The super-ego is the opposing, counterbalance to
   the id, containing all of our social norms such as morality. Though we
   grow up and develop egos and super-egos, the id constantly generates
   new desires that pressurize us in our overall psychologies and social
   relations. The work of repression is constant for as long as we are
   alive. The super-ego is mostly unconscious. In the case of dreams, the
   work of censorship is carried out by the super-ego. The ego was
   initially conceived by Freud as our sense of self. He later thought of
   it more as planning, delayed gratification and other types of thinking
   that have developed late in evolution. The ego is mostly conscious and
   has to balance the struggle between the id and the super-ego and also
   in navigating the external and internal worlds. This means that we
   experience the continual power struggle between the super-ego and the
   id. The ego has to meet a quota of fulfilling some of the id's desires,
   but only where this will marginally affect the individual.

   Freud's first topographical division of the mind consisted of the
   conscious, pre-conscious and unconscious (the pre-conscious is that
   which is not quite conscious but could quite easily be brought into
   conscious awareness). His second division of the mind into id, ego and
   super-ego explains how consciousness can become complicated when the
   two topographies are superimposed upon one another. Mental content from
   the unconscious constantly struggles to become conscious. Dreams are an
   example of unconscious content coming up to the conscious and being
   partially confronted in awareness, although the content is distorted.
   Dreaming is an opportunity for the desires of the id to be satisfied
   without causing the individual too much trouble. We cannot experience
   the desires of the id in naked form, for they would be too disturbing.
   The super-ego finds various ways of censoring a dream and fulfilling
   the desires latently. Our conscious attention is effectively
   misdirected. What we recall of dreams is further distorted as
   repression and censorship continues into attempted recollections of the
   dream. The resulting dream is always a compromise between disguise and
   the direct expression of the id's desires. The censorship is carried
   out in various ways (Hopkins, 1991: pp. 112-113). Images which are
   associated with each other are condensed (two people might become one,
   characters may morph based on fleeting similarities) and emotions are
   displaced onto other objects. Dreams are woven together in a story-like
   element to further absorb the dreamer in the manifest content.

   It is better that these wishes come disguised in apparently nonsensical
   stories in order to stop the dreamer from awakening in horror
   (Flanagan: 2000, p.43). The content of the dream, even with some
   censorship in place, still might shock an individual on waking
   reflection and is therefore further distorted by the time it reaches
   memory, for the censor is still at work. Malcolm positively cited a
   psychoanalyst who had claimed that the psychoanalyst is really
   interested in what the patient thought the dream was about (that is,
   the memory of the dream) rather than the actual experience (Malcolm,
   1959: pp. 121-123, Appendix).

   Though Freud was not an evolutionary biologist, his theory of dreams
   can be easily recast in evolutionary terms of natural selection. Freud
   thought that we dream in the way we do because it aids individuals in
   surviving and so is passed on and therefore positively selected.
   Individuals who dreamt in a significantly different way would not have
   survived and reproduced, and their way of dreaming would have died with
   them. But how does dreaming help individuals to survive? Freud
   postulates that dreaming simultaneously serves two functions. The
   primary function at the psychological level is wish fulfilment (Storr,
   1989: p.44). During the day humans have far too many desires than they
   could possibly satisfy. These are the desires continually generated by
   the id. Desire often provides the impetus for action. If acted upon,
   some of these desires might get the individual killed or in social
   trouble, such as isolation or ostracism which may potentially result in
   not reproducing. Since wish fulfilment occurring during sleep is a
   mechanism that could keep their desires in check, the mechanism would
   be selected for. Freud claims that, having fulfilled the multifarious
   desires of the id in sleep, they can remain suppressed during the
   following days. The individual no longer needs to carry the action out
   in waking life, thereby potentially stopping the individual from being
   killed or having fitness levels severely reduced. This provides reason
   as to why we would need to sleep with conscious imagery. Freud only
   applied his theory to humans but it could be extrapolated to other
   animals that also have desires - for example, mammals and other
   vertebrates, though the desires of most members of the animal kingdom
   will surely be less complex than that of human desire.

   The primary function at the physiological level is to keep an
   individual asleep while satisfying unconscious desires (Freud, 1900:
   §V, C, p.234). Also, it is clear that keeping an individual asleep and
   stopping him or her from actually carrying out the desires during sleep
   is beneficial to survival. So though the individual has their desires
   satisfied during sleep, it is done so in a disguised manner. Here,
   Freud separates the dream into manifest and latent content. The
   manifest content is the actual content that is experienced and recalled
   at the surface level (a dream of travelling on a train as it goes
   through a tunnel). The latent content is the underlying desire that is
   being fulfilled by the manifest content (a desire for sexual
   intercourse with somebody that will land the dreaming individual in
   trouble). The individual is kept asleep by the unconscious disguising
   the wishes.

   What about dreams where the manifest content seems to be emotionally
   painful, distressing, or a good example of an anxiety dream, rather
   than wish fulfilment? How can our desires be satisfied when our
   experiences do not seem to involve what we wanted? Freud suggests that
   these can be examples where the dream fails to properly disguise the
   content. Indeed, these usually wake the individual up. Freud was aware
   of an early study which suggested that dream content is biased towards
   the negative (Freud, 1900: pp. 193-194) - a study which has been
   subsequently confirmed. Freud's distinction between manifest and latent
   content explains away this objection. The underlying, latent content
   carries the wish and dreams are distorted by a psychological censor
   because they will wake an individual up if they are too disturbing, and
   then the desire will remain unsuppressed. Perhaps dreams operate with
   an emotion which is the opposite of gratification precisely to distract
   the sleeping individual from the true nature of the desire. Wish
   fulfilment might be carried out in the form of an anxiety dream where
   the desire is especially disturbing if realized. Other anxiety dreams
   can actually fulfil wishes through displacement of the emotions. Freud
   uses an example of one of his own dreams where a patient is infected
   but it fulfils the wish of alleviating the guilt he felt that he could
   not cure her (the dream of Irma's injection). The dream allowed the
   blame to be lifted away from himself and projected onto a fellow doctor
   who was responsible for the injection. Despite the displeasure of the
   dream, the wish for the alleviation guilt was fulfilled.

   The dream for Freudians relies on a distinction between indicative and
   imperative content. An indicative state of mind is where my
   representational systems show the world to be a certain way. The
   exemplar instance of indicative representations is belief. I might
   accurately perceive and believe that it is raining and I thus have an
   indicative representational mental state. Imperative states of mind, on
   the other hand, are ones in which I desire the world to be a certain
   way - a way that is different to the way it currently is. I might
   desire that it will snow. A dream is an instance of an indicative
   representation replacing an imperative one in order to suppress a
   desire. We see something in a dream and believe it is there in front of
   us. This is what we want and what we desired, so once we believe we
   have it, the desire is vanquished, making it unlikely we will try to
   satisfy the desire in waking life.

ii. Jung: Analytic Psychology

   Trying to provide even a simple exposition of Freud's or Jung's
   theories of dreams will not please all scholars and practitioners that
   adhere to the thinkers' traditions. Drawing out the differences or
   similarities between their views is an exegetical task and the
   resulting statements about their theories are thus always debatable.
   Many working in the tradition of psychoanalysis or analytical
   psychology opt for a synthesis between their views. At the risk of
   caricaturing Jung's theory of dreams, the differences in their views
   will be emphasized to contrast with Freud's.

   Like Freud, Jung also believed that dream analysis is a major way of
   gaining knowledge about the unconscious - a deep facet of the mind that
   has been present in our ancestors throughout evolutionary history. But
   Jung's evolutionary story of dreaming differs from Freud's. Whereas
   Freud understood dreams as using memory from the days preceding the
   dream (particularly the "day residue" of the day immediately leading up
   to the dream) and earlier childhood experiences, Jung thought the dream
   also worked with more distant material: the collective unconscious. The
   collective unconscious is where the ancestral memories of the species
   are stored and are common to all people. Some philosophers, such as
   Locke, had believed the mind is a blank slate. Jung believed that the
   collective unconscious underlies the psychology of all humans and is
   even identical across some different species. The collective
   unconscious is especially pronounced in dreaming where universal
   symbols are processed, known as the archetypes. The distinction between
   signs and symbols is an important one (Jung, 1968: p.3). Signs refer to
   what is already known, whereas symbols contain a multiplicity of
   meanings (Mathers, 2001: p.116). More, indeed, than can be captured,
   thereby always leaving an unknowable aspect, and hence always requiring
   further work to think about the dream, thereby hinting at future
   perspectives one may take toward oneself and one's dreams (Mathers,
   2001: p.116).

   Jung saw dreaming as playing an integral role in the overall
   architecture of the mind and conducive to surviving in the world for
   during the process of dreaming the day's experiences are connected to
   previous experiences and our whole personal history. Whereas Freud
   thought that the adaptive advantage to dreams was to distract us and
   thereby keep us asleep, Jung thought the reverse: we need to sleep in
   order to dream and dreaming serves multiple functions. What does
   dreaming do for us, according to Jung? Dreams compensate for imbalances
   in the conscious attitudes of the dreamer. Psychology depends upon the
   interplay of opposites (Jung, 1968: p.47). By dreaming of opposite
   possibilities to waking life, such as a logical individual (with a
   strong thinking function) having dreams which are much more
   feeling-based, the balance is restored (Stevens, 1994: p.106). "Dreams
   perform some homeostatic or self-regulatory function ... they obey the
   biological imperative of adaptation in the interests of personal
   adjustment, growth, and survival" (Stevens, 1994: p.104). They play a
   role in keeping the individual appropriately adapted to their social
   setting. Dreaming also carries out a more general type of compensation,
   concerning the psychology of gender. The psyche is essentially
   androgynous and so dreams provide an opportunity to balance the overall
   self to an individual's opposite gender that make up their personality
   and mind. Hence dreams are not the mere "guardians of sleep" as Freud
   thought, but are rather a necessary part to maintaining psychological
   well being and development. When the conscious is not put in touch with
   the unconscious, homeostasis is lost and psychological disturbance will
   result (Jung, 1968: p.37). Dreams serve up unconscious content that has
   been repressed, ignored or undervalued in waking life. Although he
   emphasized an objective element to dreaming (that the unconscious often
   makes use of universal and culturally shared symbols), Jung was opposed
   to the possibility of a fixed dream dictionary because the meaning of
   symbols will change depending on the dreamer and over time as they
   associate images with different meanings.

   Jung agrees with Freud that there are a wealth of symbols and
   allegorical imagery that can stand in for the sexual act, from breaking
   down a door to placing a sword in a sheath. In the course of his
   analysis, Freud would gradually move from manifest content to the
   latent content, though he did encourage the dreamer to give their own
   interpretations through free association. Jung believed that the
   unconscious choice of symbol itself is just as important and can tell
   us something about that individual (Jung, 1968: p.14). Alternatively,
   apparent phallic symbols might symbolize other notions - a key in a
   lock might symbolize hope or security, rather than anything sexual. The
   dream imagery, what Freud called the manifest content, is what will
   reveal the meaning of the dream. Where Freud had asked "What is the
   dream trying to hide?" Jung asks: "What is the dream trying to express
   or communicate?" because dreams occur without a censor: they are
   "undistorted and purposeful" (Whitmont & Perera, 1989: p.1).

   Another function of dreaming that distinguishes Jung's from Freud's
   account is that dreams provide images of the possibilities the future
   may have in store for the sleeping individual. Not that dreams are
   precognitive in a paranormal sense, Jung emphasized, but the
   unconscious clearly does entertain counter-factual situations during
   sleep. Those possibilities entertained are usually general aspects of
   human character that are common to us all (Johnson, 2009: p.46). Dreams
   sometimes warn us of dangerous upcoming events, but all the same, they
   do not always do so (Jung, 1968: p.36). The connection of present
   events to past experience is where dreams are especially functional
   (Mathers, 2001: p.126). Freud and Jung's theories clearly overlap here.
   But whereas Freud assessed dreams in terms of looking back into the
   past, especially the antagonisms of childhood experience, dreaming for
   Jung importantly also lays out the possibilities of the future. This
   clearly has survival value, since it is in the future where that
   individual will eventually develop and try to survive and reproduce.
   Dreaming for Jung is like "dreaming" in the other sense - that of
   aspiring, wishing and hoping. Dreams point towards our future
   development and individuation. The notion of personal development
   brought about by dreaming might depend upon regularly recalling a
   dream, which is something that Freud's claim of wish fulfilment need
   not be committed to, and it is not clear how this deals with animal's
   dreaming.

   Dreams are a special instance of the collective unconscious at work,
   where we can trace much more ancient symbolism. The collective
   unconscious gives rise to the archetypes: "the universal patterns or
   tendencies in the human unconscious that find their way into our
   individual psyches and form us. They are actually the psychological
   building blocks of energy that combine together to create the
   individual psyche" (Johnson, 2009: p.46). Dreams demonstrate how the
   unconscious processes thought in "the language of symbolism" (Johnson,
   2009: p.4). The most important function of dreams is teaching us how to
   think symbolically and deal with communication from the unconscious.
   Dreams always have a multiplicity of meanings, can be re-interpreted
   and new meanings discovered. Jung believed that "meaning making
   enhances survival" (Mathers, 2001: p.117). According to Flanagan, it is
   much harder to construe Jung's theory of dreams as adhering to the
   basic tenets of evolutionary biology than Freud's, for two fundamental
   reasons. Firstly, why would the collective unconscious expressing
   symbols relevant to the species have any gains in terms of reproductive
   success? Secondly, Jung's theory is more often interpreted in
   Lamarckian, and not Darwinian, terms, which leaves it out in the cold
   in regards to accepted evolutionary biology (Flanagan, 2000: p.44).
   According to Lamarck's conception of evolution, traits developed during
   a lifetime can then be subsequently passed onto the next generation.
   Hence Lamarck believed that the giraffe got its long neck because one
   stretched its neck during its lifetime to reach high up leaves and this
   made the neck longer, a trait which was passed onto its offspring.
   According to the  widely favoured Darwinian view of evolution, those
   giraffes that just so happened to have a longer neck would have had
   access to the source of food over those with shorter necks, and would
   have been selected. Jung's theory is interpreted as Lamarckian rather
   than Darwinian because symbols that are learned during an individual's
   particular historical period can be genetically encoded and passed on
   (Flanagan, 2000: p.64). Perhaps one could reply in Jungian-Darwinian
   terms that those individuals who just so happened to be born with a
   brain receptive to certain symbols having certain meanings (rather than
   learning them), survived over those individuals that did not. But then
   Flanagan's first reason remains as an objection - what advantage would
   this have in terms of surviving? Others have argued that the collective
   unconscious is actually much more scientifically credible than critics
   have taken it to be. According to the line of argument, the collective
   unconscious essentially coincides with current views about innate
   behaviours, in fields such as socio-biology and ethology (Stevens,
   1994: p.51). Appropriate environmental (or cognitive) stimuli trigger
   patterns of behaviours or thought that are inherited, such as hunting,
   fighting and mothering. In humans, there are, for example, the
   universal expressions of emotion (anger, disgust, fear, happiness,
   sadness, surprise). Humans and other mammals have an inbuilt fear of
   snakes that we do not need to learn. These patterns can be found in
   dreams. The dream images are generated by homologous neural structures
   that are shared amongst animals, not merely passed on to the next
   generation as images. The Jungian can dodge the accusation of
   Lamarckism by arguing that dreams involve inherited patterns of
   behaviour based on epigenetic rules (the genetically inherited rules
   upon which development then proceeds for an individual) and arguing
   that epigenetics does not necessarily need to endorse Lamarckism
   (epigenetics is a hot topic in the philosophy of biology. For a cogent
   introduction, readers can consult Jablonka & Lamb, 2005).
   Alternatively, in light of epigenetics, the Jungian can defend a
   Lamarackist view of evolution - a re-emerging but still controversial
   position.

   To rehearse the differences: Freud believed that dreams are the result
   of a power struggle between the id's constantly generating desires and
   the super-ego's censorship of the exact nature of these desires;
   various techniques are employed by the censor, including emotional
   displacement, weaving together a narrative to pay attention to and
   reworking the latent desires into the manifest content we experience
   and eventually and occasionally recollect; dreams are a distraction to
   keep us asleep; dreaming is a mechanism that has been selected to
   provide social stability amongst individuals. Dreams essentially deal
   with one's relationship to their past. Jung thought dreams point
   towards the future development of the individual. The experiences which
   process symbols shared amongst the species are a form of compensation
   to keep the individual at a psychological homeostasis. Dreams do not
   especially deal with sexuality but have a more general attempt for the
   individual to understand themselves and the world they exist in.

b. Contemporary Approaches

i. Pluralism

   Flanagan represents a nuanced position in which dreaming has no
   fitness-enhancing effects on an organism that dreams, but neither does
   it detract from their fitness. Dreams are the by-products of sleep. The
   notion of evolutionary by-product, or spandrel (see figures 6 and 7),
   was first introduced by the evolutionary Pluralists Gould and Lewontin
   in "The Spandrels of San Marco and Panglossian Paradigm" where the
   authors borrowed the term from the field of architecture. Evolutionary
   Pluralism claims that traits in the natural world are not always the
   result of natural selection, but potentially for a plurality of other
   reasons. The debate between Adaptationists and Pluralists centres on
   the pervasiveness of natural selection in shaping traits. Pluralists
   look for factors other than natural selection in shaping a trait, such
   as genetic drift and structural constraints on development. One
   important example is the spandrel. Some traits might be necessary
   by-products of the design of the overall organism.


   Fig 6



   Fig 7


   The two separate architectural examples, figures 6 and 7, display
   spandrels as roughly triangular spaces. The point that Gould and
   Lewontin are making by introducing the notion of spandrel is that some
   aspects of the design of an object inevitably come as a side-effect.
   Perhaps the architect only wanted archways and a dome. In producing
   such a work of architecture, spandrels cannot be avoided. If
   architecture can tell us something about metaphysical truths, then
   might dreams be such spandrels, lodged in between thought and sleep?
   Flanagan, an evolutionary Pluralist, argues that there is no
   fitness-enhancing function of dreaming. Though, as a matter of
   structure, we cannot avoid dreaming for dreams sit in between the
   functioning of the mind and sleep, like spandrels between two
   architecturally desired pillars in an archway. Hence Flanagan's
   argument is that in evolutionary biological terms, dreaming is not for
   anything - it just comes as a side effect to the general architecture
   of the mind. He states more strongly that "so long as a spandrel does
   not come to detract from fitness, it can sit there forever as a side
   effect or free rider without acquiring any use whatsoever" (Flanagan,
   2000: p.108). Dreaming neither serves the function of wish-fulfilment
   or psychological homeostasis. Flanagan emphasizes the disorganized
   nature of dreaming, something which can clearly be appealed to given
   any individual's experience of dreams. To be sure, wish-fulfilment and
   apparent psychological compensation sometimes appear in dreams, but
   this is because we are just thinking during sleep and so a myriad of
   human cognition will take place. Another reason put forward by Flanagan
   for the view that dreams are spandrels is that, unlike for sleep, there
   is nothing close to an ideal adaptation explanation for dreaming
   (Flanagan, 2000: p.113). The ideal explanation lays out what evidence
   there is that selection has operated on the trait, gives proof that the
   trait is heritable, provides an explanation of why some types of the
   trait are better adapted than others in different environments and
   amongst other species and also offers evidence of how later versions of
   the trait are derived from earlier ones. The spandrel thesis about
   dreaming is more plausible, then, because trying to argue that dreams
   have function ends up as nothing more than a "just-so" story, the
   result of speculation and guess work that cannot meet the standards of
   an ideal adaptation explanation.

ii. Adaptationism

   Antti Revonsuo stands in opposition to Flanagan by arguing that
   dreaming is an adaptation. He also stands in opposition to Freud and
   Jung in that the function of dreams is not to deliver wish fulfilment
   whilst keeping the individual asleep or to connect an individual to the
   symbolism of the collective unconscious. Revonsuo strives to deliver an
   account that meets the stringent criteria of a scientific explanation
   of the adaptation of dreaming. Though there have been many attempts to
   explain dreaming as an Adaptation, few come close to the ideal
   adaptation explanation, and those functional theories favoured by
   neurocognitive scientists (for example, dreams are for consolidating
   memories or for forgetting useless information) cannot clearly
   distinguish their theory of the function of dreams from the function of
   sleep, that is, the spandrel thesis. The Threat Simulation Theory
   account can be clearly distinguished from the spandrel thesis.
   According to Revonsuo, the actual content of dreams is helpful to the
   survival of an organism because dreaming enhances behaviours in waking
   life such as perceiving and avoiding threat. Revonsuo's Threat
   Simulation Theory presents dreams as specializing in the recreation of
   life-like threatening scenarios. His six claims are as follows: Claim
   1: Dream experience is more an organized state of mind than
   disorganized; Claim 2: Dreaming is tailored to and biased toward
   simulating threatening events of all kinds found in waking life; Claim
   3: Genuine threats experienced in waking life have a profound effect on
   subsequent dreaming; Claim 4: Dreams provide realistic simulacra of
   waking life threatening scenarios and waking consciousness generally;
   Claim 5: Simulation of perceptual and motor activities leads to
   enhanced performance even when the rehearsal is not recalled later;
   Claim 6: Dreaming has been selected for (Revonsuo, 2000).

   The Threat Simulation Theory is committed to a certain conception of
   dreams as a realistic and organized state of consciousness, as implied
   by Claim 1. This claim motivates the challenge to any spandrel thesis
   of dreams by asking why dreams would show the level of organization
   that they do, namely, the construction and engagement of virtual
   realities, if they were just mere "mental noise" as a spandrel thesis
   might imply or be committed to. Dreaming is allegedly similar to waking
   life and is indeed experienced as waking life at least at the time of
   the dream (Valli & Revonsuo, 2009: p.18). These features of dreams are
   essential in putting in motion the same sort of reaction to threat that
   will occur during waking life and aid survival. Hence the dream self
   should be able to react in the dream situation with reasonable courses
   of action to combat the perceived threat in ways that would also be
   appropriate in real life. Revonsuo appeals to phenomenological data
   where a significant proportion of dreams involve situations in which
   the dreamer comes under attack. We do indeed generally have more
   negative emotions during an REM related dream. This claim is well
   supported by experiential examples of dreaming, where anxiety is the
   most frequent emotion in dreaming, joy/ elation was second and anger
   third (Hobson, 1994: p.157), making two thirds of dream emotion
   negative. That dreams process negative emotions likely occurs because
   the amygdala is highly activated. The amygdala is also the key brain
   part implicated in the "fight or flight" sympathetic nervous system
   response to especially intense life-threatening situations. During
   waking hours this part of the brain is used in handling unpleasant
   emotions like anxiety, intense fear or anger. This is well explained by
   the Threat Simulation Theory. We experience more threats in dreams (and
   especially demanding ones) than in waking life because it is selected
   to be especially difficult, leaving the individual bestowed with a
   surplus of successful threat avoidance strategies, coping skills and
   abilities to anticipate, detect and out-manoeuvre the subtleties of
   certain threats.

   Though Revonsuo claims that dreams specialize in the full panoply of
   threatening scenarios that will effect overall survival, the most
   obvious example is the "fight or flight" response. All instances of
   stress in waking life occur when an individual feels threatened and
   this will feed back into the system of acknowledging what is dangerous
   and what is not. In waking life, the fight or flight response
   essentially involves making a snap decision in a life or death
   situation to fight a predatory enemy or flee from the scene. The
   activation of the Sympathetic Nervous System - the stress response
   implicated in the fight or flight response - is an involuntary,
   unconsciously initiated process. One might object to Claims 1 and 4,
   that many dreams simply do not seem realistic representations of
   threatening scenarios such as those requiring the fight or flight
   response. One study found, for example, that many recurrent dreams are
   unrealistic (Zadra et al, 2006). Revonsuo has some scope for manoeuvre
   for he believes that dreams may no longer be adaptive due to the
   dramatic environmental changes, and the possible adaptation for human
   dream consciousness was when humans were hunter-gatherers in the
   Pleistocene environment over a period of hundreds of thousands of
   years; so dream content may now no longer seem to have the same
   function, given that we live in a radically different environment.
   Dreams are then comparable to the human appendix - useful and adaptive
   in times when our diet was radically different, but now an essentially
   redundant and, occasionally, maladaptive vestigial trait.

   Dreams may have also become more lax in representing threatening
   content in the Western world, since life and death threatening
   situations are no longer anywhere near as common as in the evolutionary
   past. This will be the case because a lack of exposure to threat in
   waking life will not activate the threat simulation system of dreaming
   as it did in earlier times. Revonsuo uses evidence of ordinary dream
   reports from the population but he also cites cases of psychopathology
   such as the dreams of individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder
   (PTSD), where, crucially, their traumatic and threatening experiences
   dramatically affects what they dream about. Thus the relationship
   between dreaming and experiencing threats in waking life is
   bi-directional: Dreams try to anticipate the possible threats of waking
   life and improve the speed of perceiving and ways of reacting to them.
   At the same time, any perceived threats that are actually experienced
   in waking life will alter the course of later dreaming to re-simulate
   those threats perceived. This feedback element dovetails with Claim 4
   for an accurate picture will be built as information is constructed
   from the real world.

   Perhaps the updating element of the Threat Simulation Theory (Claim 4 -
   that individuals learn from what is threatening and this gets passed
   onto offspring) suffers from the same accusation of Lamarckism that
   faces Jung's theory. Revonsuo believes that dreaming during sleep
   allows an individual to repetitively rehearse the neurocognitive
   mechanisms that are indispensable to waking life threat perception and
   avoidance. Flanagan asks why behaviour that is instinctual would need
   to be repetitively rehearsed, but what is provided by Revonsuo is an
   explanation of how instinct is actually preserved in animals. But not
   all of our dreams are threatening. This fact surely helps the Threat
   Simulation Theory to show that there is variation amongst the trait and
   that the threatening type comes to dominate. The neural mechanisms, or
   hardware, underlying the ability to dream are transferred genetically
   and became common in the population. Those individuals with an
   insufficient number of threatening dreams were not able to survive to
   pass on the trait because they were left ill prepared for the trials
   and tribulations of the real world's evolutionary environment. One
   might still object that survival - the avoidance of threat - is only
   one half of propagating a trait. Individuals also have to reproduce for
   the trait to be passed on. So dreams ought to also specialize in
   enhancing behaviours that help individuals to find mates. Animals and
   humans have many and varied courting rituals, requiring complicated
   behaviours If dreaming can, and does, make any difference to behaviour
   in waking life as Revonsuo must claim, then why would the presence of
   mate selection behaviours not make up a big factor in dreams? In
   humans, no more than 6% of adult dreams contain direct sexual themes
   (Flanagan, 2000: p.149). There is also a slight gender difference in
   that males tend to dream more of male characters than female
   characters. Given that many threats would have occurred from same sex
   individuals within one's own species, this fares well for the claim
   that dreams are for threat perception and rehearsal, but not for
   courtship rituals that could help pass on the trait. There are ways
   around this objection, however. Threatening and sexual encounters are
   such polar opposites that different parts of the nervous system deal
   with them - the sympathetic and parasympathetic - dramatically
   alternating between the two could potentially disrupt sleep. Clearly,
   simply surviving is prioritized over reproducing.

5. Dreaming in Contemporary Philosophy of Mind and Consciousness

a. Should Dreaming Be a Scientific Model?

   Visual awareness has been used as the model system in consciousness
   research. It is easy to manipulate and investigate. Humans are
   predominantly visual creatures and so visual awareness is an excellent
   paradigm of conscious experience, at least for humans. A good example
   of the virtues of using paradigm cases to study, from biological
   science, is drosophila melanogaster (the common fruit fly). This
   organism is often used in experiments and routinely cited in papers
   detailing experiments or suggesting further research. A scientific
   model is a practical necessity and the fruit fly has such a fast
   reproduction rate that it allows geneticists to see the effects of
   genes over many generations that they would not see in their own
   lifetime in, say, humans. The fruit fly also has enough genetic
   similarity to humans such that the findings can be extrapolated. Hence,
   a model system has something special about it - some ideal set of
   features for empirically investigating. Model systems are good because
   they ideally also display the phenomena being investigated in an
   "exceptionally prominent form" (Revonsuo, 2006: p.73-74).

i. Dreaming as a Model of Consciousness

   Revonsuo (2006) argues that dreaming should also have a place alongside
   visual awareness, as a special instance of consciousness and therefore
   a worthy model to be studied. Revonsuo argues that the dreaming brain
   also captures consciousness in a "theoretically interesting form"
   (Revonsuo, 2006: p.73). The claim is that dreaming is an unusually rare
   example of "pure" consciousness, being as it is devoid of ongoing
   perceptual input and therefore might deserve special status in being
   scientifically investigated. The system is entirely dependent on
   internal resources (Metzinger, 2003: p.255) and is isolated from the
   external world. Representational content changes much quicker than in
   the waking state, and this is why Metzinger claims that dreams are more
   dynamic (Metzinger, 2003: p.255). Whereas Malcolm and Dennett had
   argued that dreams are not even plausibly conscious states, Revonsuo
   and Metzinger argue that dreams may reveal the very essence of
   consciousness because of the conditions under which dream consciousness
   takes place. Crucially, there is a blockade of sensory input. Only very
   rarely will sensory input contribute to information processing during
   dreaming, (Metzinger, 2003: p.257) for example in dreams where the
   sound of the alarm clock is interwoven into a narrative involving
   wedding bells. This means that most other dreams are "epistemically
   empty" with regard to the external environment. At no other time is
   consciousness completely out of synch with the environment, and, so to
   speak, left to its own devices. Dreaming is especially interesting and
   fundamentally similar to waking consciousness because it entails
   consciousness of a world which we take to be the real one, just as we
   do during waking consciousness. "Only rarely do we realize during the
   dream that it is only a dream. The estimated frequency of lucid dreams
   varies in different studies. Approximately 1 to 10% of dream reports
   include the lucidity and about 60% of the population have experienced a
   lucid dream at least once in their lifetime (Farthing, 1992; Snyder &
   Gackenbach, 1988). Thus, as many as 90 to 99% of dreams are completely
   non-lucid, so that the dream world is taken for real by the dreamer"
   (Revonsuo, 2006: p.83).

   Revonsuo does not so much argue for the displacement of visual
   awareness qua a model system, as arguing that dreaming is another
   exemplary token of consciousness. Dreaming, unlike visual awareness, is
   both untainted by the external world and behavioural activity
   (Revonsuo, 2006: p.75). Dreams also reveal the especially subjective
   nature of consciousness: the creation of a "world-for-me".

   Another reason that might motivate modelling dreaming is that it might
   turn out to be a good instance for looking at the problem of
   localization in consciousness research. For example, during dreaming
   the phenomenology is demonstrably not ontologically dependent on any
   process missing during dreaming. Any parts of the brain not used in
   dreaming can be ruled out as not being necessary to phenomenal
   consciousness (Revonsuo, 2006: p.87).

   During dreams there is an output blockade (Revonsuo, 2006: p.87;
   Metzinger, 2003: p.257), making dreaming an especially pure and
   isolated system. Malcolm had argued that dreaming was worthy of no
   further empirical work for the notion was simply incoherent, and
   Dennett was sceptical that dreams would turn out to even involve
   consciousness. The radical proposal now is that dreaming ought to be
   championed as an example of conscious experience, a mascot for
   scientific investigation in consciousness studies. It is alleged that
   dreams can recapitulate any experience from waking life and for this
   reason Revonsuo concludes that the same physical or neural realization
   of consciousness is instantiated in both examples of dreaming and
   waking experience (Revonsuo, 2006: p.86).

ii. Dreaming as a Contrast Case for Waking Consciousness

   The argument of Windt & Noreika (2011) firstly lays out the alleged
   myriad of problems with taking dreaming as a scientific model in
   consciousness research and then proposes positive suggestions for the
   role dreaming can play in consciousness studies. They reject dreaming
   as a model system but suggest it will work better as a contrast system
   to wakefulness. The first major problem with using dreaming as a model
   of consciousness is that, whilst, for example, in biology everybody
   knows what the fruit fly is, there are a number of different
   conceptions and debates surrounding key features and claims about
   dreaming. Hence there is no accepted definition of dreaming (Windt,
   2010: p.296). Taking dreaming as a model system of course requires and
   depends upon exactly what dreaming is characterized as. Revonsuo simply
   assumes his conception of dreaming is correct. He believes that
   dreaming can be a model of waking consciousness because dreams can be
   identical replicas of waking consciousness involving all possible
   experiences. Windt & Noreika believe that dreams tend to be different
   to waking life in important ways.

   There are further problems with modelling dreams. Collecting dream
   reports in the laboratory might amount to about five reported dreams a
   night. This is not practical at all compared to visual awareness where
   hundreds of reportable experiences can occur in minutes without
   interference (Windt & Noreika, 2011: p.1099). Scientists do not even
   directly work with dreams themselves, but rather descriptions of
   dreams. There is also the added possibility of narrative fabrication
   (the difference between dream experience and dream report). During the
   dream itself, it is known that we do not have clarity of awareness as
   in waking life and we do have a poor memory during the dream
   experience. Though lucid dreaming is an exception to this rule, it
   differs from ordinary dreaming and lucid dreaming has not been proposed
   as a model. The laboratory is needed to control and measure the
   phenomenon properly but this in itself can influence the dream content
   and report and so the observer effect and interviewer biases are
   introduced.

   It is not clear that these are insurmountable methodological problems.
   It might be very difficult to investigate dreams but this comes with
   the territory of trying to investigate isolated consciousness. Revonsuo
   is also not suggesting removing visual awareness as the paradigm model,
   only that dreaming ought to be alongside it. The fact remains, however,
   that despite suggestions from Revonsuo and others, dreaming being used
   as a model has simply not yet taken place (Windt & Noreika, 2011:
   p.1091), regardless of the theoretical incentives.

   The problems with the modelling approach point us toward the more
   modest contrast analysis approach. Windt & Noreika argue that the
   contrast analysis of dreaming with other wake states should at least be
   the first step in scientific investigation, even if we wanted to
   establish what ought to be a model in consciousness research (Windt,
   2011: p.1102). What are the reasons for endorsing the positive proposal
   of using dreams in a contrast analysis with waking life? Though waking
   consciousness is the default mode through which individuals experience
   the world, dreaming is the second global state of consciousness. As
   displayed in reports, dreams involve features which are markedly
   different to that of waking life - bizarreness and confabulation being
   key hallmarks of dreaming but not waking consciousness. The two states
   of waking and dreaming are mediated by radically different
   neurochemical systems. During wakefulness, the aminergic system is
   predominantly in control and for dreaming the cholinergic system takes
   over (Hobson, 1994: pp. 14-15; Hobson, 2005: p.143). This fundamental
   difference offers an opportunity to examine the neurology and
   neurochemistry that underpins both states of consciousness. The
   contrast analysis does not ignore dreaming, but proposes a more modest
   approach. With research divided between waking consciousness, dreaming
   and a comparison of the two states, this more practical approach will
   yield better results, so Windt and Noreika argue. By using the proposed
   method, we can see how consciousness works both with and without
   environmental input. Surely both are as equally important as each
   other, rather than trying to find reason to privilege one over the
   other. After all, both are genuine examples of consciousness. This
   approach also means that the outcome will be mutually informative as
   regards the two types of consciousness with insights gained in both
   directions. It is important to compare dreaming as an important example
   of consciousness operating with radically changed neural processing to
   waking consciousness (Windt & Noreika, 2011: p.1101). With the
   contrastive analysis there is the prospect of comparing dream
   consciousness to both pathological and non-pathology waking states, and
   there is thereby the promise of better understanding how waking
   consciousness works and how it can also malfunction. We spend about a
   tenth of our conscious lives dreaming, and yet it is one of the most
   difficult mental states to scientifically investigate. The contrast
   analysis is put forward as a possible solution to the problem of how to
   integrate dreams into consciousness studies. Windt and Noreika add the
   further proposal that dreams can be more specifically contrasted with
   pathological, non-pathological and altered states of consciousness.
   Unlike the modelling option, the contrast analysis seems to be how
   dreams have been hitherto investigated and so has already proven to be
   a viable option. This should not definitively preclude the modelling
   option, however. Perhaps modelling dreams really would be ideal simply
   because it involves isolated consciousness and the practicality
   concerns may be overcome in the future.

   It remains the case that "one of the central desiderata in the field of
   empirical dream research is a commonly accepted definition of dreaming"
   (Windt, 2010: p.296). There are also examples of consciousness at the
   periphery of sleep that makes it difficult to delineate the boundaries
   of what does and does not count as a dream (Mavromatis, 1987: p.3;
   `hypnagogic' experiences are the thoughts, images or
   quasi-hallucinations that occur prior to and during sleep onset whilst
   `hypnopompic' experiences are thoughts, images or quasi-hallucinations
   that occur during or just after waking; these states are now known
   collectively as hypnagogia). This is a problem that both the modelling
   and the contrast analysis approach both must confront.

b. Is Dreaming an Instance of Images or Percepts?

   Some believe that dreaming involves mental imagery of both
   hallucinatory and imagistic nature (Symons: 1993: p.185; Seligman &
   Yellen, 1987). However, other philosophers such as Colin McGinn believe
   that dreams should only be thought of in terms of images (the
   imagination) or percepts (perceptual experience). It is better to not
   inflate our ontology and invoke a third category that dreams are sui
   generis (of their own kind) if we do not need to. There are reasons why
   we should not believe dreams are a unique mental state. It would be
   strange, McGinn claims, if "the faculties recruited in dreaming were
   not already exploited during waking life" (McGinn, 2004: p.75). So he
   believes that dreaming is an instance of a psychological state we are
   already familiar with from waking life: perception (hallucination) or
   the imagination. There is a separate epistemic question of whether
   dreams involve beliefs or imaginings (Ichikawa, 2009). This debate
   comes apart from the psychological one as to whether the phenomenology
   of dreaming is percept or imagining because all four possible
   combinations can be held: A theorist might claim that dreams are
   hallucination which involve belief; another theorist might claim that
   dreams involve hallucinations which we do not generate belief, but we
   are rather always entertaining our dream hallucinations as imagined
   possibilities. Alternatively, dreams might involve the psychological
   state of the imagination and yet we happen to believe in our imaginings
   as though they were real; finally, dreams might involve imaginings
   which we recognize as such, imaginings and not beliefs. Though the two
   debates come apart, in waking life the psychological state of imagining
   is usually accompanied by the propositional attitude of imagining that
   something is the case, rather than believing that the something
   (psychologically imagined) is the case. Perception, or hallucination,
   usually triggers belief that what is perceived is the case, rather than
   merely imagining that what is perceived is the case. So if dreams are
   psychologically defined in terms of percepts, we can expect that dreams
   likely also involve belief because percepts usually trigger belief.
   This is not always the case, however. For example, a schizophrenic
   might come to realize that his hallucinations do not really express a
   way the world is and so no longer believe what he perceives. If dreams
   are propositionally imagined, then we would usually expect our
   imaginings to be recognized as not being real and therefore triggering
   the propositional attitude of imagining rather than believing that what
   we are imaging (in the psychological sense) that something is the case.
   There are more nuanced views than the four possible combinations.
   McGinn claims that dreaming involves the imagination and quasi-belief.
   When we dream we are immersed in the fictional plot, as we are in
   creative writing or film.

i. Dreaming as Hallucination

   It is worth noting that the psychological literature assumes that
   dreams are hallucinations that occur during sleep. It is the typically
   unquestioned psychological orthodoxy that dreams are perceptual/
   hallucinatory experiences. Evidence can be cited for dreams as percepts
   from neuroscience:

   The offline world simulation engages the same brain mechanisms as
   perceptual consciousness and seems real to us because we are unaware
   that it is nothing but a hallucination (except very rarely in lucid
   dreams). (Valli & Revonsuo, 2009: p.19)

   In REM sleep, when we are lying still due to muscle paralysis, the
   motor programs of the brain are nonetheless active. Phenomenologically,
   our dream selves are also highly active during dreams. As the content
   of a dream reveals, we are always on the move. Apart from the bodily
   paralysis, physiologically the body acts as though it perceives a real
   world, and continually reacting to events in that apparently real
   world. It is known that individuals will carry out their dream actions
   if the nerve cells that suppress movement are surgically removed or
   have deteriorated due to age, as demonstrated in people with REM Sleep
   Behavior Disorder. This suggests that dreaming involves the ordinary
   notion of belief because it is tied to action in the usual way and it
   is only because of an additional action-suppressing part of the brain
   that these actions are not carried out. We know that percepts
   ordinarily trigger belief and corresponding action, whereas the
   imagination does not.

   The claim that dreams are hallucinations can find support in the
   further claim that dreaming replicates waking consciousness. Many
   philosophers and psychologists make note of the realistic and organized
   nature of dreams, and this has been couched in terms of a virtual
   reality, involving a realistic representation of the bodily self which
   we can feel. Consider false awakenings, where an individual believes
   they have woken up in the very place they went to sleep, yet they are
   actually still asleep in dreaming. False awakenings can arguably be
   used in support of the view that dreaming is hallucinatory because such
   dreams detail a realistic depiction of one's surroundings. Dreams fit
   the philosophical concept of hallucination as an experience
   intrinsically similar to legitimate perceptual states with the
   difference that the apparent stimulus being perceived is non-existent
   (Windt, 2010: pp. 298-299). It is the job of perceptual states to
   display the self in a world.

   Empirical evidence suggests that pain can be experienced in dreams,
   which is perceptual in nature and which the imagination can arguably
   not replicate. So dreams must be hallucinatory, according to this line
   of reasoning. It is not clear though whether this rules out dreams as
   mainly imaginative with occasional perceptual elements introduced. Pain
   is, after all, a rarity in dreaming.

   We can plausibly speculate that human ancestors fell prey to a major
   metaphysical confusion and thought that their dreams involved genuine
   experiences in the past, including visitations from the dead and
   entering a different realm. Though few believe this today, we can
   sympathize with our ancestors' mistake which is further supported by
   the occasional everyday feeling where we can be hesitant to categorize
   a memory of an experience as a dream or a waking event. We usually
   decide, not based on introspection, but on logical discrepancies
   between the memory and other factors. These two reasons suggest that we
   cannot always easily distinguish between dream experience and waking
   experience, because they are another instance of percepts.

   Finally, we seem to have real emotions during dreams which are the
   natural reaction to our perceptions. According to the percept view of
   dreams, we dream that we are carrying actions out in an environment,
   but our accompanying emotions are not dreamed and play out alongside
   the rest of the dream content. The intensity of the emotions, actually
   felt, is what the percept theorist will take as support for the content
   of the dream not being merely imagined, but the natural response of
   realistic, perceptual-like experience.

ii. Dreaming as Imagination

   A number of philosophers believe that dreaming is just the imagination
   at work during sleep (Ichikawa, 2008; Sosa, 2007; McGinn, 2004, 2005).
   Any conscious experiences during sleep are imagistic rather than
   perceptual. McGinn puts forward some reasons in favour of believing
   that dreams are imaginings. Firstly, he introduces The Observational
   Attitude: if we are perceiving (or hallucinating), say, two individuals
   having a conversation then we might need to strain our senses to hear
   or see what they are discussing. During dreams of course, the body is
   completely relaxed and the sleeping individual shows no interest in his
   or her surroundings. When imagining in waking life, I try to minimize
   my sensory awareness of the surrounding environment in order to get a
   better and more vivid picture of what it is I am imagining. For
   example, if I want to imagine a new musical tune, I do best to switch
   the radio off or cover my ears. Dreaming is the natural instance of
   shutting out all of our sensory awareness of the outside world,
   arguably to entirely engage the imagination. This suggests that the
   dreamer is hearing with their mind's ear and seeing with their mind's
   eye. They are entertaining images, not percepts. Secondly, McGinn
   claims that percepts and images can coexist in the mind in waking life.
   We can perceive at the same time as imagining. The novel presupposes
   that the reader can perceive the text at the same time as imagining its
   content. It ought to be possible, McGinn argues, that if dreams are
   hallucinatory, we should be able to imagine at the same time. If I am
   surfing in a dream, I should be able to imagine the Eiffel tower at the
   same time. In dreams we cannot do this, there is just the dream, McGinn
   claims, with no further ability to simultaneously imagine other
   content. Related to the Observational Stance is the notion of
   Recognition in dreams. In dreams we seem to already know who all of the
   characters are, without making any effort to find out who they are
   (without using any of our senses). This might suggest that in dreams we
   are partly in control of the content (even if we fail to realize it)
   because we allegedly summon up the characters that we want to. We
   recognize who dream characters are, such as relatives, even when they
   look drastically different. It is not clear, on the other hand, that we
   really are in control of other dream characters and that we accurately
   recognize them, for example, Gerrans (2012) has claimed that the same
   mechanism of misidentification is present in dreams as in certain
   delusional states where the feeling of familiarity of a person is
   over-active and aimed at the wrong individuals (as in Fregoli
   delusion). On this view, we do not accurately bring to mind certain
   dream characters, we try to identify them and make mistakes. This would
   be an alternative way of accommodating the evidence.

   In the 1940's and 1950's, a survey found that a majority of Americans
   thought that their own dreams, and dreams more generally, occurred in
   black and white. Crucially, people have thought prior to and after this
   period that dreams occur in colour. This period coincided with the
   advent of black and white television. According to Schwitzgebel, the
   most reasonable conclusion to draw is that dreams are more like
   imagining written fiction, sketchy and without any colour; I can read a
   novel without summoning any definite imagery to mind (Schwitzgebel,
   2002: p.656). Perhaps this is akin to reading a novel quickly and
   forming vague and indefinite imagery. Ichikawa also argues that
   dreaming involves only images and is indeterminate to colour because
   images can be indeterminate to colour, but to hallucinate would require
   some determinacy in colour, whether black and white or in full colour
   Crucially, even outside of Schwitzgebel's findings, people have raised
   the question whether we dream in colour or black and white - something
   needs to explain the very possibility of such a dispute; "the
   imagination model may provide the best explanation for disagreement
   about colour sensation in dreams"  (Ichikawa, 2009: p.109). McGinn also
   believes that dreams can be indeterminate to colour, and they can be
   coloured in during the waking report, which can be affected by the
   current media.

The Fascinating Neuroscience of Lucid Dreaming

   In our dreams, we typically don't question bizarre phenomena, like
   losing all our teeth or being chased by giant orange snakes. We accept
   the strange reality of our dream worlds, unable to find a reasonable
   explanation or solution.

   That's because during sleep, we lose the ability to reflect critically
   on our own thoughts and analyses, a process known as metacognition. But
   sometimes, something tips us off. It suddenly becomes clear -- we don't
   normally go to school in a giant dripping cave or have the ability to
   fly, and we realize: This is a dream.

   The state of recognizing you are dreaming is known as lucid dreaming.
   In neuroscience terms, this happens when your capacity for
   metacognition comes back online. You're able to examine your beliefs in
   the moment and assess whether the conclusions you're drawing -- like
   "my school is a cave" or "I was always able to fly" -- jibe with
   reality.

   "The mind is quite restricted during sleep and dreaming, but lucid
   dreaming is the exception. Our reflective capability can be as strong
   and intact as it is during wakefulness," said Martin Dresler, principal
   investigator at the Donders Sleep & Memory lab at Radboud University in
   the Netherlands.

   For the most part, we can't consciously choose what we dream about. But
   actively recognizing you are dreaming creates the opportunity for
   varying levels of dream control. Advanced lucid dreamers can alter the
   plot of their dreams, transform themselves into animals or other
   people, change their environment, and distort the laws of physics.

   Most people lucid dream just a few times in their lifetime, if at all.
   And even if they gain an awareness of their dream state, it's even more
   rare to be able to actively control their dream content in real time.

   "Something like one in 1,000 or so people just spontaneously have lucid
   dreams on a regular basis," said Benjamin Baird, an assistant research
   professor at the University of Texas at Austin. "It's interesting that
   this segment exists."

Piecing Together What Makes a Lucid Dream

   An April 2025 Journal of Neuroscience study led by Çagatay Demirel, a
   PhD researcher in Dresler's lab, used EEG data from different labs
   around the world to try to get a clearer picture of the lucid dreaming
   brain. They found widespread communication across different brain
   regions. But when it comes to pinpointing which specific areas were
   particularly active, the picture is still quite fuzzy.
   A diagram of heightened alpha wave connectivity
   Dresler's team found lucid dreaming is associated with widespread
   communication across different brain regions. This diagram from their
   2025 study shows heightened alpha wave connectivity in posterior brain
   regions compared to typical REM sleep.
   Journal of Neuroscience

   "After the initial Eureka-like insight of `I'm in a dream!', this
   realization just lingers in the back of the lucid dreamer's mind,
   whereas the ongoing dream scenario ... [is] in the mental focus,"
   Dresler explained. Even though the brain regions involved in lucidity
   are active, their precise signals are obscured by the "neural noise" of
   the actual dream, he added, making their EEG recordings hard to
   capture.

   fMRI studies do a better job of pinpointing activity in specific brain
   regions, but they are expensive, and because lucid dreams are so rare,
   there's no guarantee a study participant will achieve the desired state
   while in the machine. In 2012, Dresler's team successfully completed
   the only fMRI ever performed of an actively lucid dreaming brain. They
   found certain brain regions that are usually relatively quiet during
   REM sleep -- including the prefrontal cortex, precuneus, and
   occipito-temporal cortices -- showed activation in the person's brain
   while lucid dreaming.

   Six years later, Baird and his colleagues used fMRI to study the brains
   of 14 frequent lucid dreamers while they were awake and not performing
   any specific tasks. What they found was strikingly similar to Dresler's
   observations of the brain while actively lucid dreaming: increased
   communication between the brain's metacognition center -- the
   prefrontal cortex -- and parietal and temporal structures, which are
   associated with high-level cognition.

   The findings indicate "a more tight-knit community of higher-order
   association hubs in the brain[s]" of frequent lucid dreamers, said
   Baird. This research suggests frequent lucid dreamers have a relatively
   high capacity for things like metacognition and cognitive control, or
   the ability to regulate thoughts, attention, and emotions.

The Effect of Dreams on Waking Life

   Those with strong dream control use this power in a variety of ways,
   from spiritual development to overcoming deep-seated fears. Some lucid
   dreamers even use their sleeping hours to train for sports or dance
   performances or process problems they face in waking life.

   But according to one study, the most common application of lucid
   dreaming is wish fulfillment. Lucid dreamers are able to carry out
   desires out of reach in waking life, like exploring outer space or
   interacting with a loved one who passed away. Even though these
   scenarios did not happen in real life, the pleasurable experiences of
   lucid dreams seem to have a "spill-over effect" into waking life,
   leading to positive daytime mood.

   These insights have sparked a new interest in exploring lucid
   dreaming's potential for treating mental health disorders. In 2018, the
   American Academy of Sleep Medicine started to recommend it as a therapy
   for nightmare disorders, including those associated with post-traumatic
   stress disorder (PTSD). Neuroscientists have also found ways to treat
   insomnia with lucid dream therapy, which can ameliorate some
   psychiatric symptoms.

   But turning lucid dreaming into a treatment may not be so simple, and
   such a therapy would carry a unique set of risks. Failed attempts at
   lucid dreaming can result in sleep paralysis -- waking up but being
   temporarily unable to move -- or false awakening -- the disorienting
   experience of thinking you're awake and carrying out your day, only to
   realize you are still asleep. Such experiences can blur the line
   between dream life and reality, which can exacerbate symptoms for those
   prone to delusions or hallucinations.

A Rare Gift, But A Learnable Skill

   Still, the allure of reaching this rare state of consciousness has led
   to creative ways to try to get there. Techniques to induce lucid
   dreaming are difficult to master and almost guarantee multiple nights
   of interrupted sleep. In the 1990s, lucid dream induction headsets hit
   the commercial market, but their high price tags and varying
   effectiveness make them a controversial choice.

   Baird and his team found the Alzheimer's drug galantamine, which is
   used to treat memory and other cognitive impairments, increases lucid
   dream frequency by up to 42% compared to placebo. The drug increases
   levels of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter known to play a role in REM
   sleep, which is when most lucid dreaming occurs.

   However, some believe the therapeutic potential of lucid dreaming comes
   by building the skills of metacognition and cognitive control.
   Researchers are studying how practices reinforcing these skills like
   meditation may encourage lucid dreaming while offering the added
   benefits of stress reduction, improved sleep, and other enhanced
   markers of well-being.

   Baird described meditation as neurocognitive training for the very
   skills required to lucid dream. "You kind of develop this `witness
   mode' where you're recognizing the state of your mind," said Baird.
   "You also have to be able to notice if your mind has drifted from the
   target and then bring it back, and so that involves a kind of
   metacognitive reflection."

   Research shows long-term meditators are prone to lucid dreaming. But in
   a 2019 study, when Baird and his team had non-meditators undergo eight
   weeks of mindfulness training, they found no increase in lucid dream
   frequency.

   He believes the meditation protocol was simply too weak. "It was kind
   of like an intro to meditation," he said. "It's not like, say, going on
   a two-month retreat where you're meditating for eight hours per day."
   And one of Baird's recent studies suggests some meditation styles may
   be more effective in facilitating lucid dreaming than others.

An Ancient Practice to Control Your Dreams

   "Mindfulness is the tip of the iceberg," said S. Gabriela
   Torres-Platas, a neuroscientist at Northwestern University. She is
   studying the effects of Tibetan dream yoga on sleep and mental health.
   This contemplative practice incorporates a variety of meditative
   exercises into waking and sleeping life, and its specific goal is to
   induce lucid dreams for personal insight and spiritual growth.

   Before bed, a practitioner might review the events of their day,
   assessing whether their actions demonstrated a mindful, volitionally
   controlled response or a reactive, emotionally dysregulated response.

   Those moments of reacting without thinking "create non-lucidity," said
   Katie Love, a dream yoga practitioner and participant in Torres-Platas'
   study, suggesting that a lack of awareness over our actions in waking
   life encourages a lack of awareness in dream states.

   Dream yogis perform seemingly impossible tasks in their lucid dreams,
   like transforming into different dream characters, walking through
   walls, or multiplying one object into thousands of copies. These
   techniques allow practitioners to help cultivate mastery within their
   dream worlds, which may foster a greater sense of empowerment and
   agency in their waking lives.

   "We perceive the world as rigid and solid," said Torres-Platas, but
   "when you can go into a dream and change your environment by, for
   example, walking through a wall, you train your mind for flexibility"
   in the real world.

   She hypothesizes that practicing specific meditation techniques while
   awake, combined with lucid dreaming while asleep, may help ease
   symptoms of anxiety and depression by increasing one's insight and
   control over their thoughts and emotions.

   "You have learned to react in a certain way, so it bypasses conscious
   awareness," said Torres-Platas, highlighting how automatic patterns can
   override metacognition and self-regulation. "It's like when someone
   insults you, and you snap back -- there's no space for reflection or
   choice in the moment."

   She said the deep self-reflection required to gain lucidity while
   dreaming may teach us how to better navigate difficult circumstances.
   Instead of persisting in a mindset of agony or hopelessness, we can
   reflect on how we process and analyze the world, which gives us the
   opportunity to reframe our thoughts. Where pessimistic beliefs leave us
   stuck in a swirling pit of despair, lucid dreaming might open a path to
   something else.

Why Your Brain Needs to Dream

   Research shows that dreaming is not just a byproduct of sleep, but
   serves its own important functions in our well-being.
   By Matthew Walker | October 24, 2017
     * Print
     * Bookmark

   We often hear stories of people who've learned from their dreams or
   been inspired by them. Think of Paul McCartney's story of how his hit
   song "Yesterday" came to him in a dream or of Mendeleev's
   dream-inspired construction of the periodic table of elements.

   But, while many of us may feel that our dreams have special meaning or
   a useful purpose, science has been more skeptical of that claim.
   Instead of being harbingers of creativity or some kind of message from
   our unconscious, some scientists have considered dreaming to be an
   unintended consequence of sleep--a byproduct of evolution without
   benefit.

   Sleep itself is a different story. Scientists have known for a while
   now that shorter sleep is tied to dangerous diseases, like heart
   disease and stroke. There is mounting evidence that sleep deprivation
   leads to a higher risk of obesity and Alzheimer's disease. Large
   population studies reflect a saddening truth--the shorter your sleep,
   the shorter your life. Not only that, sleep helps us to hold onto our
   memories and to learn facts and skills faster, making it important for
   everyone including infants, students, athletes, pilots, and doctors.

   Much of this I outline in my new book, Why We Sleep: Unlocking the
   Power of Sleep and Dreams, which summarizes the many findings we have
   about sleep and its function in our lives.

   But what about dreaming? Does it also have a purpose?

   Recent work in my neuroscience lab and the work of other scientists has
   shown that dreams may have a very particular function important to our
   well-being. Here are the two main ways dreams help us.

Dreaming is like overnight therapy

   It's said that time heals all wounds, but my research suggests that
   time spent in dream sleep is what heals. REM-sleep dreaming appears to
   take the painful sting out of difficult, even traumatic, emotional
   episodes experienced during the day, offering emotional resolution when
   you awake the next morning.

   REM sleep is the only time when our brain is completely devoid of the
   anxiety-triggering molecule noradrenaline. At the same time, key
   emotional and memory-related structures of the brain are reactivated
   during REM sleep as we dream. This means that emotional memory
   reactivation is occurring in a brain free of a key stress chemical,
   which allows us to re-process upsetting memories in a safer, calmer
   environment.

       Learn why sleep is key to peak performance.

   How do we know this is so? In one study in my sleep center, healthy
   young adult participants were divided into two groups to watch a set of
   emotion-inducing images while inside an MRI scanner. Twelve hours
   later, they were shown the same emotional images--but for half the
   participants, the twelve hours were in the same day, while for the
   other half the twelve hours were separated by an evening of sleep.

   Those who slept in between the two sessions reported a significant
   decrease in how emotional they felt in response to seeing those images
   again, and their MRI scans showed a significant reduction in reactivity
   in the amygdala, the emotional center of the brain that creates painful
   feelings. Moreover, there was a reengagement of the rational prefrontal
   cortex of the brain after sleep that helped maintain a dampening
   influence on emotional reactivity. In contrast, those who remained
   awake across the day showed no such dissolving of emotional reactivity
   over time.

   That in itself doesn't say anything about the role of dreaming. But we
   had recorded each participant's sleep during the intervening night
   between the two test sessions, and we found that specific brain
   activity that reflected a drop in stress-related brain chemistry during
   the dream state determined the success of overnight therapy from one
   individual to the next.

   Dreaming has the potential to help people de-escalate emotional
   reactivity, probably because the emotional content of dreams is paired
   with a decrease in brain noradrenaline. Support for this idea came from
   a study done by Murray Raskind on vets with PTSD, who often suffer
   debilitating nightmares. When given the drug Prazosin--a medication
   that lowers blood pressure and also acts as a blocker of the brain
   stress chemical noradrenaline--the vets in his study had fewer
   nightmares and fewer PTSD symptoms than those given a placebo. Newer
   studies suggest this effect can be shown in children and adolescents
   with nightmares, as well, though the research on this is still in its
   infancy.

   The evidence points toward an important function of dreams: to help us
   take the sting out of our painful emotional experiences during the
   hours we are asleep, so that we can learn from them and carry on with
   our lives.

Dreaming enhances creativity and problem-solving

   It's been shown that deep non-REM sleep strengthens individual
   memories. But REM sleep is when those memories can be fused and blended
   together in abstract and highly novel ways. During the dreaming state,
   your brain will cogitate vast swaths of acquired knowledge and then
   extract overarching rules and commonalties, creating a mindset that can
   help us divine solutions to previously impenetrable problems.

   How do we know dreaming and not just sleep is important to this
   process?

   In one study, we tested this by waking up participants during the
   night--during both non-REM sleep and dreaming sleep--and gave them very
   short tests: solving anagram puzzles, where you try to unscramble
   letters to form a word (e.g., OSEOG = GOOSE). First, participants were
   tested beforehand, just to familiarize them with the test. Then, we
   monitored their sleep and woke them up at different points of the night
   to perform the test. When woken during non-REM sleep, they were not
   particularly creative--they could solve very few puzzles. But, when we
   woke up participants during REM sleep, they were able to solve 15-35
   percent more puzzles than when they were awake. Not only that,
   participants woken while dreaming reported that the solution just
   "popped" into their heads, as if it were effortless.

   In another study, I and my colleagues taught participants a series of
   relational facts--such as, A>B, B>C, C>D, and so on--and tested their
   understanding by asking them questions (e.g., Is B>D or not?).
   Afterwards, we compared their performance on this test before and after
   a full night's sleep, and also after they'd had a 60- to 90-minute nap
   that included REM sleep. Those who'd slept or had a long nap performed
   much better on this test than when they were awake, as if they'd put
   together disparate pieces of a jigsaw puzzle in their sleep.

   Some may consider this trivial, but it is one of the key operations
   differentiating your brain from your computer. It also underlies the
   difference between knowledge (retention of individual facts) and wisdom
   (knowing what they all mean when you fit them together). The latter
   seems to be the work of REM-sleep dreaming.

     "It's said that time heals all wounds, but my research suggests that
     time spent in dream sleep is what heals"

   -Dr. Matthew Walker

   Dreaming improves creative problem solving, too, according to another
   study. Participants learned to navigate a virtual maze using trial and
   error and aided by the placement of unique objects--like Christmas
   trees--at certain junctions in the maze. After this learning session,
   the group was split in two, with half napping and half watching a video
   for 90 minutes. Nappers were occasionally awoken to ask about the
   content of their dreams; those watching a video were also asked about
   thoughts going through their minds.

   Afterwards, the participants again tried to solve the maze, and those
   who napped were significantly better at it than those who didn't, as
   expected. But the nappers who reported dreaming about the maze were 10
   times better at the task than those who napped and didn't dream about
   the maze. There's a reason you've never been told to stay awake on a
   problem.

   Looking at the content of these dreams, it was clear that the
   participants didn't dream a precise replay of the learning experience
   while awake. Instead, they were cherry-picking salient fragments of the
   learning experience and attempting to place them within the catalog of
   preexisting knowledge. This is how dreaming helps us be more creative.

   While the benefits of dreaming are real, too many of us have problems
   getting a full eight hours of sleep and lose out on these advantages.
   Alternatively, we may think we're the exception to the rule--that we're
   one of those people who doesn't happen to need a lot of sleep. But
   nothing could be further from the truth. Research clearly shows that
   people who overestimate their ability to get by on less sleep are sadly
   wrong.

Five ways to enhance your sleep

   book cover of This essay was adapted from Matthew Walker's new book,
   Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams (Scribner, 2017,
   368 pages).

   So how can we be sure to get enough sleep and experience a dream state?
   While we may be tempted to use sleeping pills to get to sleep, this has
   been shown to be detrimental to dreaming. Instead of taking pills, here
   are some simple ways to enhance your sleep:

   1. Make sure your room is dark and that you are not looking at bright
   light sources--i.e., computer screens and cell phones--in the last hour
   or two before going to bed. You may even want to start dimming lights
   in your house in the earlier parts of the evening, which helps to
   stimulate sleepiness.

   2. Go to bed and wake up at approximately the same time every day. This
   helps signal to your body a regular time for sleeping. It's no use
   trying to sleep in a lot on weekends. There is no way to make up for
   regular sleep loss during the week.

   3. Keep the temperature in your house cool at night--maybe even cooler
   than you think it should be, like around 65 degrees. Your body
   temperature needs to drop at night for sleep, and a lower room
   temperature helps signal your brain that it's time to sleep.

   4. If you have trouble falling asleep, or wake in the night feeling
   restless, don't stay in bed awake. That trains the brain that your bed
   is not a place for sleeping. Instead, get up and read a book under dim
   light in a different room. Don't look at your computer or cell phone.
   When sleepiness returns, then go back to bed. Or if you don't want to
   get out of bed, try meditating. Studies suggest it helps individuals
   fall asleep faster, and also improves sleep quality.

   5. Don't have caffeine late in the day or an alcohol-infused nightcap.
   Both of these interfere with sleep--either keeping you awake or
   stimulating frequent wake-ups during the night.

   Sleep is the single most effective thing we can do to rest our brain
   and physical health each day. Atop of sleep, dreaming provides
   essential emotional first aid and a unique form of informational
   alchemy. If we wish to be as healthy, happy, and creative as possible,
   these are facts well worth waking up to.

   Darcey Harry says her biggest goal for 2026 will be to join the LPGA
   Tour.

   The Welsh golfer enjoyed a successful debut season on the Ladies
   European Tour, claiming three top-10 finishes as well as a victory in
   the Hulencourt Women's Open in June.

   Her fine form saw her qualify for the Evian Championship and the AIG
   Women's Open at her home course of Royal Porthcawl, her first taste of
   the majors.

   Harry made the cut at Porthcawl, finishing tied for 40th place, a
   result she says capped "a phenomenal week".

   "It was a dream, it was an event I'd dreamed of playing in since I was
   little," said Harry.

   "If you'd told me this time last year that I'd be here right now I
   probably wouldn't have believed you."

   Harry's early successes this season saw her quickly revise her goals.

   "After a few events the goal was to try to keep my card on tour for the
   year and to have one top-10 finish," the 22-year-old said.

   "Seventy people on the tour keep their card and that's what I was going
   for - top 70, then it became top 20, top 15 and the chase for top 10.

   "I've got the confidence to know that I can go and have that top
   10-finish if I play well. It's been a really big learning curve this
   year."

   Darcey Harry reflects on her Hulencourt Open win

   Harry says her victory in Hulencourt, Belgium, was massive for her
   confidence.

   "It took a while to really sink in that I'd won and still now I can't
   believe it happened," she told BBC Sport Wales.

   "I play it in my head over and over again and try to get that feeling
   back as inspiration."

   She says it was "meant to be" as that victory ensured her place at her
   home course for the Women's Open.

   "It opened the door to play in two majors, which were certainly not on
   my list.

   "It's taught me to believe in myself and chase for another win and
   another and see how far I can take it."

   Harry finishes the 2025 season ranked fourth among rookies and 14th
   overall.

   "I showed myself that I do have the potential to play on the tour, with
   some of the world's best women, which has been great," she said.

   As for her goals for 2026, Harry's focus is clear.

   "I definitely want to win again on the LET Tour - that's everyone's
   dream - but the biggest goal for next year is to try to get out on the
   LGPA tour in America," she said.

   "If it doesn't happen next year it'll be the goal for the year after.

   "I'm going to really pick and choose the calendar quite wisely next
   year, and just enjoy being out there and see how far I can come with my
   game.

   "I've played a lot of events this year, the schedule has been hectic,
   so next year is going to be great to properly plan and get everything
   sorted."

   A move across the world could also be on the cards for the Dinas Powys
   native.

   "I'm thinking about going to Dubai now in January with my partner, so
   that's a new step in my career for sure," she added.

   "The facilities there are a golfer's dream and it's something that I
   need to do for my career to take the next step."

   What Is Dreaming and What Does It Tell Us about Memory? [Excerpt]

   Dreams may play a role in memory incorporation and influence our
   long-term moods, physiology and creativity

   By Penelope A. Lewis

   Excerpted with permission fromThe Secret World of Sleep: The Surprising
   Science of the Mind at Rest, by Penelope A. Lewis. Available from
   Palgrave Macmillan Trade. Copyright © 2013. (Scientific American and
   Palgrave Macmillan are part of the Holtzbrinck Publishing Group.)

   You are terrified and running along a dark, narrow corridor. Something
   very evil and scary is chasing you, but you're not sure why. Your fear
   is compounded by the fact that your feet won't do what you want--it
   feels like they are moving through molasses. The pursuer is gaining,
   but when it finally catches you, the whole scene vanishes...and you
   wake up.

   Almost by definition, a dream is something you are aware of at some
   level. It may be fragmentary, disconnected, and illogical, but if you
   aren't aware of it during sleep then it isn't a dream. Many people will
   protest, "I never remember my dreams!," but that is a different matter
   entirely. Failing to remember a dream later on when you're awake
   doesn't mean you weren't aware of it when it occurred. It just means
   the experience was never really carved into your memory, has decayed in
   storage, or isn't accessible for easy call back.

     __________________________________________________________________

   We all intuitively know what a dream is, but you'll be surprised to
   learn there's no universally accepted definition of dreaming. One
   fairly safe catch-all is "all perceptions, thoughts, or emotions
   experienced during sleep." Because this is very broad, there are also
   several different ways of rating, ranking, and scoring dreams. For
   example, one uses an eight-point rating system from 0 (no dream) to 7
   ("an extremely long sequence of 5 or more stages").

   Physical Bases of Dreams
   But let me backtrack. One aim of neuroscience is to map the brain loci
   of thoughts and mental experiences. Everything we see, imagine, or
   think about is linked to neural responses somewhere in the brain.
   Dreams also have a home. Neural activity in the primary sensory areas
   of the neocortex produces the impression of sensory perception. This
   means that neurons firing in the primary visual cortex create the
   illusion of seeing things, neurons firing in the primary auditory area
   create the illusion of hearing things, and so forth. If that firing
   occurs at random, these perceptions can feel like crazy, randomly
   fragmented hallucinations. It is easy to imagine that the random
   imagery and sensations created in this way could be woven together to
   create a complex, multisensory hallucination which we might call a
   dream.

   ...

   Do Dreams Serve a Purpose?
   In contrast to an activation-synthesis model, which views dreams as
   epiphenomena--a simple by-product of neural processes in sleep--other
   scientists have suggested that dreams serve an important function. As
   usual in psychology, there are lots of different ideas about what this
   function could be. Sigmund Freud's suggestion that dreams express
   forbidden desires is of course the most famous of these, but there are
   lots of other theories about what dreams might do, many with more
   empirical support than the Freudian view. For example, the threat
   simulation hypothesis suggests that dreams may provide a sort of
   virtual reality simulation in which we can rehearse threatening
   situations, even if we don't remember the dreams. Presumably, this
   rehearsal would lead to better real-life responses, so the rehearsal is
   adaptive. Evidence supporting this comes from the large proportion of
   dreams which include a threatening situation (more than 70 percent in
   some studies) and the fact that this percentage is much higher than the
   incidence of threats in the dreamer's actual daytime life. Furthermore,
   studies of children in two different areas of Palestine show that those
   who live in a more threatening environment also have a much higher
   incidence of threat in their dreams. Reactions to these threats are
   almost always relevant and sensible, so the rehearsal (if that's what
   it is) clearly involves plausible solutions, again suggesting that they
   provide a kind of valid simulation of potential real-life scenarios.

   Another suggestion is that dreams influence the way you feel the next
   day, either in terms of mood or more basic bodily states. Forcing
   people to remember the nastier dreams from their REM sleep definitely
   puts them in a foul mood, and nightmares (defined as very negative
   dreams which can wake you up) may even lead to ongoing mood problems.
   On the other hand, there is also evidence that dreams could help to
   regulate long-term mood. For instance, a study of dreams in divorced
   women showed that those who dreamed about their ex-husbands more often
   were better adapted to the divorce. Amazingly enough, dreams also seem
   able to influence physiological state: One study showed that people who
   were deprived of water before they slept, but then drank in their
   dreams, felt less thirsty when they woke up.

   The content of dreams can be influenced in lots of different ways. For
   instance, recent work has shown that sleepers tend to initiate pleasant
   dreams if nice smells are wafted at them in REM sleep, and they have
   negative or unhappy dreams if stinky, unpleasant smells are sent their
   way. Some people can achieve lucid dreaming, in which they control the
   sequence of events in their dream, and evidence suggests that these
   techniques can be learned by intensive practice and training. All of
   this is highly tantalizing, of course, because (though it tells us
   nothing at all about the original evolved purpose of dreams) it
   suggests we might not only be able to set ourselves up for pleasant
   experiences while we sleep, but we might also eventually be able to use
   these techniques to treat mood disorders, phobias, and other
   psychological problems. We already know that hypnotic suggestion can
   cause people to incorporate snakes, spiders, or other things about
   which they have phobias into their dreams, and--when combined with more
   benign forms of these menacing objects--such incorporation helps to
   remove the phobia. Hypnotic suggestion can also make dreams more
   pleasant, and mental imagery practiced during the day can be used to
   modify (and often nullify) persistent nightmares.

   There is little evidence that people actually learn during their
   dreams. The fact that they can learn during sleep is a different
   matter, but dreams themselves don't appear to be a good forum for
   imprinting new information into the hippocampus (after all, we don't
   even remember our dreams most of the time). Studies of language
   learning illustrate this well. Although learning efficiency is
   predicted by an increase in the percentage of the night that is spent
   in REM, the dreams which are experienced during this extra REM don't
   have much to do with language. If they relate to it at all they are
   most often about the frustration of not being able to understand
   something and not about the mechanics of how to construct or decode a
   sentence.

   Memories in Dreams
   What's the most recent dream you can remember? Was anyone you know in
   it? Did it happen in a place you know well? Were you doing something
   familiar? Most dreams incorporate fragments of experiences from our
   waking lives. It's common to dream about disconnected snippets like a
   particular person, place, or activity. But do dreams ever replay
   complete memories--for instance, the last time you saw your mother,
   including the place, activities, and people? Memories like this are
   called episodic because they represent whole episodes instead of just
   fragments; studies the secret world of sleep of dreaming show that
   these types of memories are sometimes replayed in sleep, but it is
   quite rare (around 2 percent of dreams contain such memories, according
   to one study). Most of our dreams just recombine fragments of waking
   life. These fragments are relatively familiar and reflect the interests
   and concerns of the dreamer. This means cyclists dream about cycling,
   teachers dream about teaching, and bankers dream about money.

   Some researchers have capitalized upon dream reports to gain insight
   into the process by which memories are immediately incorporated (i.e.,
   in the first night after they were initially experienced). Freud
   famously referred to this as "day-residues." One study showed day
   residues appear in 65 to 70 percent of single dream reports. On the
   other hand, a more recently described phenomenon called the dream-lag
   effect refers to the extraordinary observation that, after its initial
   appearance as a day residue, the likelihood that a specific memory will
   be incorporated into dreams decreases steadily across the next few
   nights after the memory was formed, then increases again across the
   following few nights (Fig. 20).

   Thus, it is very common for memories to be incorporated into dreams on
   the first night after they were initially experienced (if I have a car
   crash today, I'm likely to dream about it tonight). The likelihood of
   such incorporation decreases gradually across the next few nights, with
   few memories incorporated into dreams three to five days after they
   occurred. Extraordinarily, however, the probability that a memory will
   be incorporated into a dream increases again on nights six and seven
   after it was initially experienced. What is going on here? Why are
   memories less likely to be incorporated into dreams three to five days
   after they originally occurred than six to seven days afterward? One
   possibility relates to the need for consolidation. Memories may be
   inaccessible at this stage because they are being processed in some way
   which takes them temporarily "offline." Notably, this effect is only
   true for people who report vivid dreams, and it also appears to only be
   true of REM dreams. As with most research, the dream-lag effect raises
   more questions than it answers.

   Why Do We Have Different Kinds of Dreams at Different Stages of the
   Night?
   Dreams aren't all the same. Everyone is aware of the difference between
   good and bad dreams, but we don't tend to notice that some dreams are
   more logical and structured while others are more bizarre. Some dreams
   are so highly realistic that it is difficult to convince ourselves they
   aren't real, while others are fuzzy and indistinct. Some dreams are
   fragmented, jumping rapidly from one topic to another, while others
   move forward in a more coherent story. Recent analyses have suggested
   that these differences are far from random; instead they may be driven
   by the physiology of various brain states and the extent to which
   structures like the hippocampus and neocortex are in communication
   during different sleep stages.

   Dreams occur in all stages of sleep, but they seem to become
   increasingly fragmented as the night progresses. In general, they
   appear to be constructed out of a mishmash of prior experience. As
   mentioned above, dreams contain disconnected memory fragments: places
   we've been, faces we've seen, situations that are partly familiar.
   These fragments can either be pasted together in a semi-random mess or
   organized in a structured and realistic way. The dreams that occur in
   non-REM sleep tend to be shorter but more cohesive than REM dreams, and
   often they relate to things that just happened the day before. REM
   dreams that occur early in the night often also reflect recent waking
   experiences, but they are more fragmented than their non-REM
   counterparts. Conversely, REM dreams that occur late in the night are
   typically much more bizarre and disjointed.

   Simply thinking about where these memory fragments are coming from and
   how they are connected together may provide an explanation for the
   difference between early and late-night dreams. The various elements of
   an episode are thought to be stored in the neocortex, but they are not
   necessarily linked together to form a complete representation. For
   example, if your memory of having dinner last night involves memories
   about a specific place, specific sounds, specific actions, and maybe
   even memories about other people who were there, each of these bits of
   information is represented by a different area of the neocortex. Even
   though they combine together to make up a complete memory, these
   various neocortical areas may not be directly interlinked. Instead, the
   hippocampus keeps track of such connections and forms the appropriate
   linkages, at least while the memory is relatively fresh. However,
   communication between the neocortex and hippocampus is disrupted during
   sleep, so this process is also disrupted. During REM sleep, both the
   hippocampus and those parts of the neocortex which are involved in a
   current dream are strongly active--but they don't appear to be in
   communication. Instead, responses in the neocortex occur independently,
   without hippocampal input, so they must relate to memory fragments
   rather than linked multisensory representations. Essentially, when
   memories which have been stored in the neocortex are accessed or
   activated during REM, they remain fragmentary instead of drawing in
   other aspects of the same memory to form a complete episodic replay.
   These fragments aren't linked together in the way they might be if you
   thought of the same place while you were awake (or indeed in non-REM
   sleep). For instance, cortical representations of both someone who was
   present for your dinner last night and of the place where it was held
   may be triggered, but these will not necessarily be linked together,
   and they may not be linked to the idea of dinner or eating at all.
   Instead, seemingly unrelated characters and events may be activated in
   conjunction with the memory of this place. One possible driver for this
   is the stress hormone cortisol, which increases steadily across the
   night. High cortisol concentrations can block communication between the
   hippocampus and neocortex, and since concentrations are much higher
   early in the morning, this could provide a physiological reason for the
   disjointed properties of late-night (early morning) dreams.

   Irrespective of how it happens, it is clear that dreams not only replay
   memory fragments but also create brand-new, highly creative mixtures of
   memories and knowledge. This process has led to the creation of many
   works of literature, art, and science, such as Mary Shelley's
   Frankenstein, the molecular formula of benzene, and the invention of
   the light bulb. An especially good demonstration of this somnolent
   creativity comes from a study of 35 professional musicians who not only
   heard more music in their dreams than your normal man-on-the-street but
   also reported that much of this (28 percent) was music they had never
   heard in waking life. They had created new music in their dreams!

   Although we don't quite understand how dreams achieve this type of
   innovative recombination of material, it seems clear that the sleeping
   brain is somehow freed of constraints and can thus create whole
   sequences of free associations. This is not only useful for creativity,
   it is also thought to facilitate insight and problem solving. It may
   even be critical for the integration of newly acquired memories with
   more remote ones (see chapter 8). In fact, this facilitated lateral
   thinking could, in itself, be the true purpose of dreams. It is
   certainly valuable enough to have evolved through natural selection.

   Verywell / Brianna Gilmartin

   We spend roughly one-third of our lives sleeping--and during that time,
   we dream. Many theories exist to explain why we dream, but researchers
   still don't know for sure. Some believe dreams have symbolic meaning,
   whereas others believe that they relate to waking life.

   What scientists do know is that just about everyone dreams every time
   they sleep, and those dreams can be fascinating, exciting, terrifying,
   or just plain weird.

   Most of those dreams are forgotten within minutes of waking. Most
   people dream in color, but some dream in black and white. Our dream
   content can also differ from one person to the next, and some people
   can control what they dream about as if they were writing the script.
   If you've ever wondered what makes dreams so fascinating and sometimes
   strange, exploring some dream facts can help you gain greater insight
   into this state of consciousness.

We Dream Every Night

   The brain is active all night long. Brain activity in the forebrain and
   midbrain is particularly intense during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep,
   which is when we dream.

   Adults and babies alike dream for around two hours per night, even if
   they don't remember it. In fact, researchers have found that people
   usually have several dreams each night, each typically lasting for five
   to 20 minutes.

   During a typical lifetime, people spend an average of six years
   dreaming.
   When Dreams Merge With Your Waking Life--What to Know About Deja Reve

We Forget Most of Our Dreams

7 Theories on Why We Dream Simplified

   We forget up to 95% of all dreams shortly after waking.

   According to one theory about why dreams are so difficult to remember,
   changes in the brain during sleep don't support the information
   processing and storage needed to form memories.

   Brain scans of sleepers have shown that the frontal lobes--the area
   that plays a key role in memory formation--are inactive during REM
   sleep, the stage in which dreaming occurs.

   We might also forget our dreams because of changes in the levels of
   certain neurotransmitters, specifically acetylcholine and
   norepinephrine, during REM sleep.

   Yet another study found a link between dream recall and the brain
   matter density of the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). Participants
   with higher white matter density were more likely to recall their
   dreams.

Not All Dreams Are in Color

   According to a 2017 study, around 50% of people report dreaming in
   color almost all of the time. However, they also suggested they dream
   in black and white around 10% of the time. An older 2008 study
   suggested that roughly 12% of people dream only in black-and-white.

   People younger than 25 rarely report dreaming in black and white.
   However, people older than 55 report black-and-white dreams about 25%
   of the time. Researchers believe this difference results from childhood
   exposure to black-and-white television. An older study, which found
   that people in the 1940s rarely reported dreaming in color, supports
   this idea.

Men and Women Dream Differently

   Researchers have also found differences between men and women in dream
   content. In several studies, men reported dreaming about weapons
   significantly more often than women did, whereas women dreamed about
   clothing more often than men.

   Another study showed that men's dreams tend to have more aggressive
   content and physical activity, whereas women's dreams contain more
   rejection and exclusion, as well as more conversation than physical
   activity.

   Women tend to have slightly longer dreams with more characters. Men
   dream about other men twice as often as they do about women; women tend
   to dream about both sexes equally. Women also report having more
   nightmares than men.

Animals Probably Dream

   Many think that, when a sleeping dog wags its tail or a sleeping cat
   swats its paws, it's dreaming. Although no one can say for sure,
   researchers believe that most animals go through REM and non-REM sleep
   stages, so they probably do dream.

   Animals might not experience dreams in the same way as humans, however.
   In other words, they might not remember images or attach a storyline to
   them.

You Can Control Your Dreams

   A lucid dream is one in which you're aware that you're dreaming even
   though you're still asleep.

   Lucid dreaming is thought to be a combination of consciousness and REM
   sleep, during which you can direct or control the dream content.

   People can learn how to have lucid dreams using various techniques,
   including mnemonic induction of lucid dreams (MILD) and
   senses-initiated lucid dreams (SSILD). These involve waking up after
   five hours and repeating a phrase like "I will remember my dream" or
   focusing on the stimuli (sights, sounds, sensations) in your sleep
   environment, respectively.

   Approximately half of all people can remember at least one instance of
   lucid dreaming, and some are able to have lucid dreams frequently.

Negative Dreams Are More Common

   Researcher Calvin S. Hall, collected more than 50,000 dream accounts
   from college students over more than 40 years. Made available to the
   public in the 1990s by Hall's student, William Domhoff, the dream
   accounts reported many emotions during dreams.

   Several factors affect the emotional content of dreams, including
   anxiety, stress, and certain medications. Research has found that
   external stimuli, including good and bad smells, can play a role in
   positive and negative dreams.

   The most common emotion experienced in dreams is anxiety. Generally,
   negative emotions are much more common than positive ones.
   How to Interpret Your Dreams

Blind People May Dream Visually

   In one study of people who have been blind since birth, they still
   seemed to experience visual imagery in their dreams, and they had eye
   movements that correlated to visual dream recall.

   Although they had fewer eye movements during REM sleep than the sighted
   participants, the blind participants reported the same dream
   sensations, including visual content.

You're Paralyzed While Dreaming

   REM sleep is characterized by paralysis of the voluntary muscles. This
   phenomenon is known as REM atonia and prevents you from acting out your
   dreams while you're asleep. Basically, because motor neurons are not
   stimulated, your body does not move.

   In some cases, this paralysis can even carry over into the waking state
   for as long as 10 minutes, a condition known as sleep paralysis.

   Although the experience can be frightening, it's perfectly normal and
   should last only a few minutes before normal muscle control returns.

Some Dreams Are Universal

   Although dreams are often influenced by personal experiences and may
   serve important adaptive functions. People across the globe report
   having similar themes in their dreams, although there may be
   differences based on their unique cultural experiences and
   environments.

   For example, people from all over the world frequently dream about
   being chased, being attacked, or falling. Other common dream
   experiences include feeling frozen and unable to move, arriving late,
   flying, and being naked in public.
   Why You Get Vivid Dreams and How to Stop Them

Takeaways

   Dreams can range from the fascinating to the anxiety-provoking to the
   just plain weird. You might wake up scratching your head and wondering
   "Why did I dream about *that*? While there's a lot we still don't know
   about dreaming, we have discovered a number of intriguing facts that
   can provide greater insights into how and why we dream.

1. Dreams and epistemology

1.1 Cartesian dream skepticism

   Dream skepticism has traditionally been the most famous and widely
   discussed philosophical problem raised by dreaming (see Williams 1978;
   Stroud 1984). In the Meditations, Descartes uses dreams to motivate
   skepticism about sensory-based beliefs about the external world and his
   own bodily existence. He notes that sensory experience can also lead us
   astray in commonplace sensory illusions such as seeing things as too
   big or small. But he does not think such cases justify general doubts
   about the reliability of sensory perception: by taking a closer look at
   an object seen under suboptimal conditions, we can easily avoid
   deception. By contrast, dreams suggest that even in a seemingly
   best-case scenario of sensory perception (Stroud 1984), deception is
   possible. Even the realistic experience of sitting dressed by the fire
   and looking at a piece of paper in one's hands (Descartes 1641: I.5) is
   something that can, and according to Descartes often does, occur in a
   dream.

   There are different ways of construing the dream argument. A strong
   reading is that Descartes is trapped in a lifelong dream and none of
   his experiences have ever been caused by external objects (the Always
   Dreaming Doubt; see Newman 2019). A weaker reading is that he is just
   sometimes dreaming but cannot rule out at any given moment that he is
   dreaming right now (the Now Dreaming Doubt; see Newman 2019). This is
   still epistemologically worrisome: even though some of his
   sensory-based beliefs might be true, he cannot determine which these
   are unless he can rule out that he is dreaming. Doubt is thus cast on
   all of his beliefs, making sensory-based knowledge slip out of reach.

   Cartesian-style skeptical arguments have the following form (quoted
   from Klein 2015):
    1. If I know that p, then there are no genuine grounds for doubting
       that p.
    2. U is a genuine ground for doubting that p.
    3. Therefore, I do not know that p.

   If we apply this to the case of dreaming, we get:
    1. If I know that I am sitting dressed by the fire, then there are no
       genuine grounds for doubting that I am really sitting dressed by
       the fire.
    2. If I were now dreaming, this would be a genuine ground for doubting
       that I am sitting dressed by the fire: in dreams, I have often had
       the realistic experience of sitting dressed by the fire when I was
       actually lying undressed in bed!
    3. Therefore, I do not know that I am now sitting dressed by the fire.

   Importantly, both strong and weak versions of the dream argument cast
   doubt only on sensory-based beliefs, but leave other beliefs unscathed.
   According to Descartes, that 2+3=5 or that a square has no more than 4
   sides is knowable even if he is now dreaming:

     although, in truth, I should be dreaming, the rule still holds that
     all which is clearly presented to my intellect is indisputably true.
     (Descartes 1641: V.15)

   By Descartes' lights, dreams do not undermine our ability to engage in
   the project of pure, rational enquiry (Frankfurt 1970; but see
   Broughton 2002).

1.2 Earlier discussions of dream skepticism and why Descartes' version is
special

   Dream arguments have been a staple of philosophical skepticism since
   antiquity and were so well known that in his objections to the
   Meditations, Hobbes (1641) criticized Descartes for not having come up
   with a more original argument. Yet, Descartes' version of the problem,
   more than any other, has left its mark on the philosophical discussion.

   Earlier versions tended to touch upon dreams just briefly and discuss
   them alongside other examples of sensory deception. For example, in the
   Theaetetus (157e), Plato has Socrates discuss a defect in perception
   that is common to

     dreams and diseases, including insanity, and everything else that is
     said to cause illusions of sight and hearing and the other senses.

   This leads to the conclusion that knowledge cannot be defined through
   perception.

   Dreams also appear in the canon of standard skeptical arguments used by
   the Pyrrhonists. Again, dreams and sleep are just one of several
   conditions (including illness, joy, and sorrow) that cast doubt on the
   trusthworthiness of sensory perception (Diogenes Laertius, Lives of
   Eminent Philosophers; Sextus Empiricus, Outlines of Pyrrhonism).

   Augustine (Against the Academics; Confessions) thought the dream
   problem could be contained, arguing that in retrospect, we can
   distinguish both dreams and illusions from actual perception (Matthew
   2005: chapter 8). And Montaigne (The Apology for Raymond Sebond) noted
   that wakefulness itself teems with reveries and illusions, which he
   thought were even more epistemologically worrisome than nocturnal
   dreams.

   Descartes devoted much more space to the discussion of dreaming and
   cast it as a unique epistemological threat distinct from both waking
   illusions and evil genius or brain-in-a-vat-style arguments. His claim
   that he has often been deceived by his dreams implies he also saw
   dreaming as a real-world (rather than merely hypothetical) threat.

   This is further highlighted by the intimate, first-person style of the
   Meditations. Their narrator is supposed to exemplify everyone's
   epistemic situation, illustrating the typical defects of the human
   mind. Readers are further drawn in by Descartes' strategy of moving
   from commonsense examples towards more sophisticated philosophical
   claims (Frankfurt 1970). For example, Descartes builds up towards dream
   skepticism by first considering familiar cases of sensory illusions and
   then deceptively realistic dreams.

   Finally, much attention has been devoted to several dreams Descartes
   reportedly had as a young man. Some believe these dreams embodied
   theoretical doubts he developed in the Discourse and Meditations
   (Baillet 1691; Leibniz 1880: IV; Cole 1992; Keefer 1996). Hacking
   (2001:252) suggests that for Descartes, dream skepticism was not just a
   philosophical conundrum but a source of genuine doubt. There is also
   some discussion about the dream reports' authenticity (Freud 1940; Cole
   1992; Clarke 2006; Browne 1977).

1.3 Dreaming and other skeptical scenarios

   In the Meditations, after discussing the dream argument, Descartes
   raises the possibility of an omnipotent evil genius determined to
   deceive us even in our most basic beliefs. Contrary to dream deception,
   Descartes emphasizes that the evil genius hypothesis is a mere fiction.
   Still, it radicalizes the dream doubt in two respects. One, where the
   dream argument left the knowability of certain general truths intact,
   these are cast in doubt by the evil genius hypothesis. Two, where the
   dream argument, at least on the weaker reading, involves just temporary
   deception, the evil genius has us permanently deceived.

   One modernized version, the brain-in-a-vat thought experiment, says
   that if evil scientists placed your brain in a vat and stimulated it
   just right, your conscious experience would be exactly the same as if
   you were still an ordinary, embodied human being (Putnam 1981). In the
   Matrix-trilogy (Chalmers 2005), Matrixers live unbeknownst to
   themselves in a computer simulation. Unlike the brain-in-a-vat, they
   have bodies that are kept alive in pods, and flaws in the simulation
   allow some of them to bend its rules to their advantage.

   Unlike dream deception, which is often cast as a regularly recurring
   actuality (cf. Windt 2011), brain-in-a-vat-style arguments are often
   thought to be merely logically or nomologically possible. However,
   there might be good reasons for thinking that we actually live in a
   computer simulation (Bostrom 2003), and if we lend some credence to
   radical skeptical scenarios, this may have consequences for how we act
   (Schwitzgebel 2017).

   Even purely hypothetical skeptical scenarios may enhance their
   psychological force by capitalizing on the analogy with dreams. Clark
   (2005) argues that the Matrix contains elements of "industrial-strength
   deception" in which both sensory experience and intellectual
   functioning are exactly the same as in standard wake-states, whereas
   other aspects are more similar to the compromised reasoning and bizarre
   shifts that are the hallmark of dreams.

1.4 Descartes' solution to the dream problem and real-world dreams

   At the end of the Sixth Meditation, Descartes suggests a solution to
   the dream problem that is tied to a reassessment of what it is like to
   dream. Contrary to his remarks in the First Meditation, he notes that
   dreams are only rarely connected to waking memories and are often
   discontinuous, as when dream characters suddenly appear or disappear.
   He then introduces the coherence test:

     But when I perceive objects with regard to which I can distinctly
     determine both the place whence they come, and that in which they
     are, and the time at which they appear to me, and when, without
     interruption, I can connect the perception I have of them with the
     whole of the other parts of my life, I am perfectly sure that what I
     thus perceive occurs while I am awake and not during sleep.
     (Meditation VI. 24)

   For all practical purposes, he has now found a mark by which dreaming
   and waking can be distinguished (cf. Meditation I.7), and even if the
   coherence test is not fail-safe, the threat of dream deception has been
   averted.

   Descartes' remarks about the discontinuous and ad hoc nature of many
   dreams are backed up by empirical work on dream bizarreness (see Hobson
   1988; Revonsuo & Salmivalli 1995). Still, many of his critics were not
   convinced this helped his case against the skeptic. Even if Descartes'
   revised phenomenological description characterizes most dreams, one
   might occasionally merely dream of successfully performing the test
   (Hobbes 1641), and in some dreams, one might seem to have a clear and
   distinct idea but this impression is false (Bourdin 1641). Both the
   coherence test and the criterion of clarity and distinctness would then
   be unreliable.

   How considerations of empirical plausibility impact the dream argument
   continues to be a matter of debate. Grundmann (2002) appeals to
   scientific dream research to introduce an introspective criterion: when
   we introspectively notice that we are able to engage in critical
   reflection, we have good reason to think that we are awake and not
   dreaming. However, this assumes critical reasoning to be uniformly
   absent in dreams. If attempts at critical reasoning do occur in dreams
   and if they generally tend to be corrupted, the introspective criterion
   might again be problematic (Windt 2011, 2015a). There are also cases in
   which even after awakening, people mistake what was in fact a dream for
   reality (Wamsley et al. 2014). At least in certain situations and for
   some people, dream deception might be a genuine cause of concern (Windt
   2015a).

2. The ontology of dreams

   In what follows, the term "conscious experience" is used as an umbrella
   term for the occurrence of sensations, thoughts, impressions, emotions
   etc. in dreams (cf. Dennett 1976). These are all phenomenal states:
   there is something it is like to be in these states for the subject of
   experience (cf. Nagel 1974). To ask about dream experience is to ask
   whether it is like something to dream while dreaming, and whether what
   it is like is similar to (or relevantly different from) corresponding
   waking experiences.

2.1 Are dreams experiences?

   Cartesian dream skepticism depends on a seemingly innocent background
   assumption: that dreams are conscious experiences. If this is false,
   then dreams are not deceptive experiences during sleep and we cannot be
   deceived, while dreaming, about anything at all. Whether dreams are
   experiences is a major question for the ontology of dreams and closely
   bound up with dream skepticism.

   The most famous argument denying that dreams are experiences was
   formulated by Norman Malcolm (1956, 1959). Today, his position is
   commonly rejected as implausible. Still, it set the tone for the
   analysis of dreaming as a target phenomenon for philosophy of mind.

   For Malcolm, the denial of dream experience followed from the
   conceptual analysis of sleep: "if a person is in any state of
   consciousness it logically follows that he is not sound asleep"
   (Malcolm 1956: 21). Following some remarks of Wittgenstein's (1953:
   184; see Chihara 1965 for discussion), Malcolm claimed

     the concept of dreaming is derived, not from dreaming, but from
     descriptions of dreams, i.e., from the familiar phenomenon that we
     call "telling a dream". (Malcolm 1959:55)

   Malcolm argued that retrospective dream reports are the sole criterion
   for determining whether a dream occurred and there is no independent
   way of verifying dream reports. While first-person, past-tense
   psychological statements (such as "I felt afraid") can at least in
   principle be verified by independent observations (but see Canfield
   1961; Siegler 1967; Schröder 1997), he argued dream reports (such as
   "in my dream, I felt afraid") are governed by different grammars and
   merely superficially resemble waking reports. In particular, he denied
   dream reports imply the occurrence of experiences (such as thoughts,
   feelings, or judgements) in sleep:

     If a man had certain thoughts and feelings in a dream it no more
     follows that he had those thoughts and feelings while asleep, than
     it follows from his having climbed a mountain in a dream that he
     climbed a mountain while asleep. (Malcolm 1959/1962: 51-52)

   What exactly Malcolm means by "conscious experience" is unclear.
   Sometimes he seems to be saying that conscious experience is
   conceptually tied to wakefulness (Malcolm 1956); other times he claims
   that terms such as mental activity or conscious experience are vague
   and it is senseless to apply them to sleep and dreams (Malcolm 1959:
   52).

   Malcolm's analysis of dreaming has been criticized as assuming an
   overly strict form of verificationism and a naïve view of language and
   conceptual change. A particularly counterintuitive consequence of his
   view is that there can be no observational evidence for the occurrence
   of dreams in sleep aside from dream reports. This includes behavioral
   evidence such as sleepwalking or sleeptalking, which he thought showed
   the person was partially awake; as he also thought dreams occur in
   sound sleep, such sleep behaviors were largely irrelevant to the
   investigation of dreaming proper. He also claimed adopting a
   physiological criterion of dreaming (such as EEG measures of brain
   activity during sleep) would change the concept of dreaming, which he
   argued was tied exclusively to dream reporting. This claim was
   particularly radical as it explicitly targeted the discovery of REM
   sleep and its association with dreaming (Dement & Kleitman 1957), which
   is commonly regarded as the beginning of the science of sleep and
   dreaming. Malcolm's position was that the very project of a science of
   dreaming was misguided.

   Contra Malcolm, most assume that justification does not depend on
   strict criteria with the help of which the truth of a statement can be
   determined with absolute certainty, but "on appeals to the simplicity,
   plausibility, and predictive adequacy of an explanatory system as a
   whole" (Chihara & Fodor 1965: 197). In this view, behavioral and/or
   physiological evidence can be used to verify dream reports (Ayer 1960)
   and the alleged principled difference between dream reports and other
   first-person, past-tense psychological sentences (Siegler 1967;
   Schröder 1997) disappears.

   Putnam noted that Malcolm's analysis of the concept of dreaming relies
   on the dubious idea that philosophers have access to deep conceptual
   truths that are hidden to laypeople:

     the lexicographer would undoubtedly perceive the logical (or
     semantical) connection between being a pediatrician and being a
     doctor, but he would miss the allegedly "logical" character of the
     connection between dreams and waking impressions. [...] this "depth
     grammar" kind of analyticity (or "logical dependence") does not
     exist. (Putnam 1962 [1986]: 306)

   Nagel argued that even if one accepts Malcolm's analysis of the concept
   of dreaming,

     it is a mistake to invest the demonstration that it is impossible to
     have experiences while asleep with more import than it has. It is an
     observation about our use of the word "experience", and no more. It
     does not imply that nothing goes on in our minds while we dream.
     (Nagel 1959: 114)

   Whether dream thoughts, feelings or beliefs should count as real
   instances of their kind now becomes an open question, and in any case
   there is no conceptual contradiction involved in saying one has
   experiences while asleep and dreaming.

2.2 Dreams as instantaneous memory insertions

   To ask about dream experience is also to ask whether there is something
   it is like to dream during sleep as opposed to there just being
   something it is like to remember dreaming after awakening. Dennett's
   (1976, 1979) cassette theory says dreams are the product of
   instantaneous memory insertion at the moment of the awakening, as if a
   cassette with pre-scripted dreams had been inserted into memory, ready
   for replay. Dennett claims the cassette theory and the view that dreams
   are experiences can deal equally well with empirical evidence for
   instance on the relationship between dreaming and REM sleep. The
   cassette theory is preferable because it is more parsimonious, positing
   only an unconscious dream composition process rather than an additional
   conscious presentation process in sleep. For Dennett, the important
   point is that it is impossible to distinguish between the two rival
   theories based on dream recall; the question of dream experience should
   be settled by independent empirical evidence.

   While Dennett shares Malcolm's skepticism about dream experience, this
   latter claim is diametrically opposed to Malcolm's rejection of a
   science of dreaming. For Dennett, the unreliability of dream recall
   also is not unique, but exemplifies a broader problem with memory
   reports: we generally cannot use retrospective recall to distinguish
   conscious experience from memory insertion (Dennett 1991; see also
   Emmett 1978).

   An earlier and much discussed (Binz 1878; Goblot 1896; Freud 1899; Hall
   1981; Kramer 2007:22-24) version of Dennett's cassette theory goes back
   to Maury's (1861) description of a long and complex dream about the
   French revolution that culminated in his execution at the guillotine,
   at which point Maury suddenly awoke to find that the headboard had
   fallen on his neck. Because the dream seemed to systematically build up
   to this dramatic conclusion, which in turn coincided with a sudden
   external event, he suggested that such cases were best explained as
   instantaneous memory insertions experienced at the moment of awakening.
   Similarly, Gregory (1916) described dreams are psychical explosions
   occurring at the moment of awakening.

   The trustworthiness of dream reports continues to be contentious. Rosen
   (2013) argues that dream reports are often fabricated and fail to
   accurately describe experiences occurring during sleep. By contrast,
   Windt (2013, 2015a) argues that dream reports can at least under
   certain conditions (such as in laboratory studies, when dreams are
   reported immediately after awakening by trained participants) be
   regarded as trustworthy sources of evidence with respect to previous
   experience during sleep.

2.3 Empirical evidence on the question of dream experience

   Unlike Malcolm, many believe that whether dreams are experiences is an
   empirical question; and unlike Dennett, the predominant view is that
   the empirical evidence does indeed support this claim (Flanagan 2000;
   Metzinger 2003; Revonsuo 2006; Rosen 2013; Windt 2013, 2015a).

   A first reason for thinking that dreams are experiences during sleep is
   the relationship between dreaming and REM (rapid eye movement) sleep.
   Researchers in the 1950s discovered that sleep is not a uniform state
   of rest and passivity, but there is a sleep architecture involving
   different stages of sleep that is relatively stable both within and
   across individuals (Aserinsky & Kleitman 1953, 1955; Dement & Kleitman
   1957). Following sleep onset, periods of non-REM (or NREM) sleep
   including slow wave sleep (so called because of the presence of
   characteristic slow-wave, high-voltage EEG activity) are followed by
   periods of high-frequency, low-voltage activity during REM sleep. EEG
   measures from REM sleep strongly resemble waking EEG. REM sleep is
   additionally characterized by rapid eye movements and a near-complete
   loss of muscle tone (Dement 1999: 27-50; Jouvet 1999).

   The alignment between conscious experience on the one hand and
   wake-like brain activity and muscular paralysis on the other hand would
   seem to support the experiential status of dreams as well as explain
   the outward passivity that typically accompanies them. Reports of
   dreaming are in fact much more frequent following REM (81.9%) than NREM
   sleep awakenings (43%; Nielsen 2000). REM reports tend to be more
   elaborate, vivid, and emotionally intense, whereas NREM reports tend to
   be more thought-like, confused, non-progressive, and repetitive (Hobson
   et al. 2000). These differences led to the idea that REM sleep is an
   objective marker of dreaming (Dement & Kleitman 1957; Hobson 1988:
   154).

   Attempts to identify dreaming with mental activity during REM sleep
   have not, however, been successful, and many now hold that dreams can
   occur in all stages of sleep (e.g., Antrobus 1990; Foulkes 1993b; Solms
   1997, 2000; Domhoff 2003; Nemeth & Fazekas 2018). In recent years there
   has been renewed interest in NREM sleep for the study of dreaming
   (Noreika et al. 2009; Siclari et al. 2013, 2017). This suggests the
   inference from the physiology of REM sleep to the phenomenology of
   dreaming is not straightforward.

   A second line of evidence comes from lucid dreams, or dreams in which
   one knows one is dreaming and often has some level of dream control
   (Voss et al. 2013; Voss & Hobson 2015; Baird et al. 2019). The term
   lucid dreaming was coined by van Eeden (1913), but Aristotle (On
   Dreams) already noted that one can sometimes be aware while dreaming
   that one is dreaming.

   Scientific evidence that lucid dreaming is real and a genuine sleep
   phenomenon comes from laboratory studies (Hearne 1978; LaBerge et al.
   1981) showing lucid dreamers can use specific, pre-arranged patterns of
   eye movements (e.g., right-left-right-left) to signal in real-time that
   they are now lucid and engaging in dream experiments. These signals are
   clearly identifiable on the EOG and suggest a correspondence between
   dream-eye movements and real-eye movements (as predicted by the
   so-called scanning hypothesis; see Dement & Kleitman 1957;
   Leclair-Visonneau et al. 2010). Retrospective reports confirm that the
   dreamer really was lucid and signalled lucidity (Dresler et al. 2012;
   Stumbrys et al. 2014).

   Signal-verified lucid dreams have been used to study muscular activity
   accompanying body movements in dreams (Erlacher et al. 2003; Dresler et
   al. 2011), for advanced EEG analysis of brain activity during lucid
   dreaming (Voss et al. 2009), and imaging studies (Dresler et al. 2011,
   2012). Eye signals can also be used to measure the duration of
   different activities performed in lucid dreams; contrary to the
   cassette theory, lucid dreams have temporal extension and certain dream
   actions even seem to take slightly longer than in waking (Erlacher et
   al. 2014). There have also been attempts to induce lucidity through
   non-invasive electrical stimulation during sleep (Stumbrys et al. 2013;
   Voss et al. 2014). The combination of signal-verified lucid dreaming
   with volitional control over dream content, retrospective report, and
   objective sleep measures has been proposed to provide controlled
   conditions for the study of conscious experience in sleep and a new
   methodology for investigating the relationship between conscious
   experience and neurophysiological processes (Baird et al.2019).

   A third line of evidence (Revonsuo 2006: 77) comes from dream-enactment
   behavior (Nielsen et al. 2009), most prominently in patients with
   REM-sleep behavior disorder (RBD; Schenck & Mahowald 1996; Schenck
   2005; Leclair-Visonneau et al. 2010). Due to a loss of the muscular
   atonia that accompanies REM sleep in healthy subjects, these patients
   show complex, seemingly goal-directed outward behaviors such as running
   or fighting off an attacker during REM sleep. Retrospective dream
   reports often match these behaviors, suggesting that patients literally
   act out their dreams during sleep.

   While persuasive, these lines of evidence might not satisfy skeptics
   about dream experience. They might worry that results from lucid
   dreaming and dream enactment do not generalize to ordinary, non-lucid
   dreams; they might also construe alternative explanations that do not
   require conscious experience in sleep. There are also methodological
   concerns, for instance about how closely sleep-behaviors actually match
   dream experience. A key issue is that to support the experiential
   status of dreams, evidence from sleep polysomnography, signal verified
   lucid dreams, or sleep behavior requires convergence with retrospective
   dream reports. This means trusting dream reports is built into any
   attempt to empirically resolve the question of dream experience - which
   then invites the familiar skeptical concerns. Again, an anti-skeptical
   strategy may be to appeal to explanatory considerations. In this view,
   the convergence of dream reports and objective polysomnographic or
   behavioral observations is best explained by the assumption that dreams
   are experiences in sleep, and this assumption is strengthened by
   further incoming findings. This strategy places dream reports at the
   center of scientific dream research while avoiding the contentious
   claim that their trustworthiness, and with it the experiential status
   of dreams, can be demonstrated conclusively by independent empirical
   means (Windt 2013, 2015a).

2.4 Dreams and hallucinations

   Even where philosophers agree dreams are experiences, they often
   disagree on how exactly to characterize dreaming relative to wake-state
   psychological terms. Often, questions about the ontology of dreaming
   intersect with epistemological issues. Increasingly, they also
   incorporate empirical findings.

   The standard view is that dreams have the same phenomenal character as
   waking perception in that they seemingly put us in contact with
   mind-independent objects, yet no such object is actually being
   perceived. This means dreams count as hallucinations in the
   philosophical sense (Crane & French 2017; Macpherson 2013). Even if, in
   a particularly realistic dream, my visual experience was exactly as it
   would be if I were awake (I could see my bedroom, my hands on the bed
   sheets, etc.), as long as my eyes were closed during the episode, I
   would not, literally, be seeing anything.

   There is some controversy in the psychological literature about whether
   dreams should be regarded as hallucinations. Some believe the term
   hallucination should be reserved for clinical contexts and wake-state
   pathologies (Aleman & Larøi 2008: 17; but see ffytche 2007; ffytche et
   al. 2010).

   The view that dreams involve hallucinations is implicit in Descartes'
   assumption that even when dreaming,

     it is certain that I seem to see light, hear a noise, and feel heat;
     this cannot be false, and this is what in me is properly called
     perceiving (sentire). (Descartes 1641: II.9)

   It also lies at the heart of Aristotle's (On Dreams) assumption that
   dreams result from the movements of the sensory organs that continue
   even after the original stimulus has ceased. He believed that in the
   silence of sleep, these residual movements result in vivid sensory
   imagery that is subjectively indistinguishable from genuine perception
   (see also Dreisbach 2000; Barbera 2008).

   The assumption of phenomenological equivalence between dream and waking
   experience can also be found in Berkeley's (1710: I.18) idealist claim
   that the existence of external bodies is not necessary for the
   production of vivid, wake-like perceptual experience. Similarly,
   Russell defended sense-data theory by noting that in dreams,

     I have all the experiences that I seem to have; it is only things
     outside my mind that are not as I believe them to be while I am
     dreaming. (Russell 1948: 149-150)

   Elsewhere, he argued dreams and waking life

     must be treated with equal respect; it is only by some reality not
     merely sensible that dreams can be condemned. (Russell 1914: 69)

   Hume was less clear on this matter, proposing that dreams occupy an
   intermediate position between vivid and largely non-voluntary sensory
   impressions and ideas, or "the faint images of previous impressions in
   thinking and reasoning" (Hume 1739: 1.1.1.1). On the one hand, as mere
   creatures of the mind, Hume wanted to categorize dreams as ideas. On
   the other hand, he acknowledged that in sleep, "our ideas can approach
   the vivacity of sensory impressions" (Hume 1739: 1.1.1.1). Dreams do
   not fit comfortably into Hume's attempt to draw a dichotomous
   distinction between impressions, including perception, and ideas,
   including sensory imagination (Ryle 1949; Waxman 1994; Broughton 2006).

   Phenomenologists often focus not so much on the quality of dream
   imagery as on the overall character of experience, noting that dreams
   are experienced as reality; as in waking perception, we simply feel
   present in a world. This also sets dreams apart from waking fantasy and
   daydreams (Husserl 1904/1905; Uslar 1964; Conrad 1968; Globus 1987: 89.

   At its strongest, the hallucination view claims that dreaming and
   waking experience are identical in both the quality of sensory imagery
   and their overall, self-in-a-world structure (Revonsuo 2006: 84). This
   claim is central to the virtual reality metaphor, according to which
   consciousness itself is dreamlike and waking perception a kind of
   online hallucination modulated by the senses (Llinás & Ribary 1994;
   Llinás & Paré 1991; Revonsuo 2006; Metzinger 2003, 2009).

   This seems to be empirically supported. Neuroimaging studies (Dang-Vu
   et al. 2007; Nir & Tononi 2010; Desseilles et al. 2011) show that the
   predominance of visual and motor imagery as well as strong emotions in
   dreams is paralleled by high activation of the corresponding brain
   areas in REM sleep, which may exceed waking; at the same time, the
   cognitive deficits often thought to characterize dreams such as the
   loss of self-awareness, the absence of critical thinking, delusional
   reasoning, and mnemonic deficits fit in well with the comparative
   deactivation of frontal areas (Hobson et al. 2000). Hobson (1988,
   Hobson et al. 2000) has argued that the vivid, hallucinatory character
   of dreaming results from the fact that in REM sleep, the visual and
   motor areas are activated in the same way as in waking perception, the
   sole difference being dreams' dependence on internal signal generation.
   Horikawa and colleagues (2013) used neuroimaging data from sleep onset
   to predict the types of objects described in mentation reports, which
   they took to support the perceptual equivalence between dreaming and
   waking.

   Generally, versions of the hallucination view that suggest dreams
   replicate all aspects of waking perception are too vague to be
   informative. Especially for subtle perceptual activities (such as
   visual search), we might not know enough about dream phenomenology to
   make any strong claims (Nielsen 2010). Specifying points of similarity
   leads to a more informative and precise, but likely also more nuanced
   view. Dreams are heterogeneous, and some might be more perception-like
   while others resemble imagination (Windt 2015a). There might also be
   differences between or even within specific types of imagery. For
   example, visual imagery might be quite different from touch sensations,
   which tend to be rare in dreams (Hobson 1988). Visual dream imagery
   might overall resemble waking perception but lack color saturation,
   background detail and focus (Rechtschaffen & Buchignani, 1992).
   Classifying dreams as either hallucinatory or imaginative is further
   complicated by the fact that there is strong overlap in cortical
   activity associated with both visual imagery and perception (Zeidman &
   Maguire, 2016). This means even a strong overlap in cortical activity
   between, say, visual dream imagery and visual perception does not
   necessarily set dreaming apart from waking imagination.

   This is also true for evidence on eye movements in dreams. LaBerge and
   colleagues (2018) recently showed that eye tracking of objects is
   smooth in lucid dreaming and perceiving, but not in imagining. Drawing
   from this evidence, Rosen (forthcoming) suggests many dreams mimic the
   phenomenology of interacting with a stable world, including eye
   movements and visual search. Others argue we should not analogize dream
   imagery to mind-independent, scannable objects and that eye movements
   might instead be implicated in the generation of dream imagery (Windt
   2018).

2.5 Dreams and illusions

   Another way to make sense of the claim that dreaming has the same
   phenomenal character as waking perception is to say some kinds of dream
   imagery are illusory: they involve misperception of an external object
   as having different properties than it actually has (cf. Smith 2002;
   Crane & French 2017). The illusion view disagrees with the
   hallucination view on whether dreams have a contemporaneous external
   stimulus source.

   The illusion view has fallen out of favor but has a long history. The
   Ancients believed dreams have bodily sources. This idea underlies the
   practice of using dreams to diagnose illness, as practiced in the
   shrines at Epidaurus (Galen On Diagnosis in Dreams; van de Castle
   1994). Aristotle (On Dreams) thought some dreams are caused by
   indigestion, and Hobbes adopted this view, claiming different kinds of
   dreams could be traced to different bodily sensations. For instance,
   "lying cold breedeth Dreams of Feare, and raiseth the thought and Image
   of some fearfull object" (Hobbes 1651: 91).

   Appeals to the bodily sources of dreaming became especially popular in
   the 19^th and early 20^th centuries. Many believed specific dream
   themes such as flying were linked to sleeping position (Macnish 1838;
   Scherner 1861; Vold 1910/1912; Ellis 1911) and realizing, in sleep,
   that one's feet are not touching the ground (Bergson 1914).

   There were also attempts to explain the phenomenology of dreaming by
   appealing to the absence of outward movement. The lack of appropriate
   feedback and of movement and touch sensations was thought to cause
   dreams of being unable to move (Bradley 1894) or of trying but failing
   to do something (Gregory 1918).

   Some proponents of the "Leibreiztheorie" (or somatic-stimulus theory)
   of dreaming attempted to go beyond anecdotal observations to conduct
   controlled experiments. Weygandt (1893) investigated the influence of
   various factors including breathing, blood circulation, temperature
   changes, urge to urinate, sleeping position, and visual or auditory
   stimulation during sleep on dream content (see Schredl 2010 for
   details). Singer (1924) proposed experiments on stimulus incorporation
   in dreams can inform claims on the ontology of dreaming: If dreams are
   sensations, a particular auditory stimulus should increase the
   frequency of dreams in nearby sleepers as well as the frequency of
   sound in their dreams, and it should decrease the range of quality and
   intensity of these dreams, making them overall more similar and
   predictable.

   Newer studies provide evidence for the incorporation of external
   stimuli in dreams, including light flashes, sounds, sprays of water
   applied to the skin (Dement & Wolpert 1958), thermal (Baldridge 1966),
   electrical (Koulack 1969), and verbal stimuli (Berger 1963; Breger et
   al. 1971; Hoelscher et al., 1981), as well as blood pressure cuff
   stimulation on the leg (Nielsen et al. 1995; Sauvageau et al. 1998).

   Muscular activity also often leaves its mark on dreams. It occurs
   throughout sleep but is especially frequent in REM sleep, mostly in the
   form of twitching but occasionally also in the form of larger,
   seemingly goal-directed movements (Blumberg 2010; Blumberg & Plumeau
   2016). The relation between outward and dream movements is complex: in
   some cases, outward movements might mirror dream movements, while in
   others, sensory feedback might prompt dream imagery (Windt 2018).

   Generally, it seems external and bodily stimuli can be related to
   varying degrees to dream and sleep onset imagery (Nielsen 2017; Windt
   2018; Windt et al. 2016). Some of these cases appear to fit the concept
   of illusion, as in when the sound of the alarm clock is experienced, in
   a dream, as a siren, or when blood pressure cuff inflation on the leg
   leads to dreams of wearing strange shoes (Windt 2018; for these and
   other examples, see Nielsen et al. 1995). In other cases, such as when
   blood pressure cuff stimulation on the leg prompts a dream of seeing
   someone else's leg being run over, describing this as illusory
   misperception might be less straightforward.

   Saying that dreams can be prompted by external stimuli and that in some
   cases these are best described as illusions is different from the
   stronger claim, sometimes advanced by historical proponents of
   somatic-stimulus theory, that dreams generally are caused by external
   or bodily stimuli. As an example of the stronger claim, consider
   Wundt's proposal that the

     ideas which arise in dreams come, at least to a great extent, from
     sensations, especially from those of the general sense, and are
     therefore mostly illusions of fancy, probably only seldom pure
     memory ideas which hence become hallucinations. (Wundt 1896: 179)

   This claim is likely too strong. It is also likely that appeals to
   external or bodily stimuli on their own cannot fully explain dream
   imagery, including when and how external stimuli are incorporated in
   dreams. Sensory incorporation in dreams is often hard to predict and
   indirect; associated imagery seems related not just to stimulus
   intensity, but also to short- and long term memories. A full
   explanation of dream content additionally has to take the cognitive and
   memory sources of dreaming into account (Windt 2018; Nielsen 2017; cf.
   Silberer 1919).

2.6 Dreams as imaginative experiences

   The most important rival to the hallucination view is that dreams are
   imaginative experiences (Liao & Gendler 2019; Thomas 2014). This can
   mean dream imagery involves imaginings rather than percepts (including
   hallucinations or illusions; McGinn 2004), that dream beliefs are
   imaginative and not real beliefs (Sosa 2007), or both (Ichikawa 2008,
   2009). An important advantage is that by assimilating dreams to
   commonplace mental states such as waking fantasy and daydreaming,
   rather than a rare and often pathological occurrence such as
   hallucinations, it provides a more unified account of mental life
   (Stone 1984). However, the reasons for adopting the imagination view
   are diverse, and dreams have been proposed to resemble imaginings and
   differ from perception along a number of dimensions (e.g. McGinn 2004,
   2005a,b; Thomas 2014). This issue is complicated by the fact that there
   is little agreement on the definition of imagination and its relation
   to perception (Kind 2013).

   One way is to deny dreams involve presence or the feeling of being in a
   world, which many believe is central to waking perception. Imagination
   theorists compare the sense in which we feel present in our dreams to
   cognitive absorption, as when we are lost in a novel, film, or vivid
   daydream (Sartre 1940; McGinn 2004; but see Hering 1947; Globus 1987).
   Some argue that reflexive consciousness or meta-awareness (as in lucid
   dreams) interrupts cognitive absorption and terminates the ongoing
   dream (Sartre 1940), essentially denying lucid dreams are possible.

   Another issue is whether dreams are subject to the will (Ichikawa
   2009). Imagination is often characterized as active and under our
   control (Wittgenstein 1967: 621, 633), involving "a special effort of
   the mind" (Descartes 1641: VI, 2), whereas perception is passive.
   Because dreams just seem to happen to us without being under voluntary
   control, they present an important challenge for the imagination view.
   Ichikawa (2009) argues lucid control dreams show dreams are generally
   subject to the will even where they are not under deliberate control.

   Dreams are widely described as more indeterminate than waking
   perception (James 1890: 47; Stone 1984). In scientific dream research,
   vagueness is regarded as one of three main subtypes of bizarreness
   (Hobson 1988; Revonsuo & Salmivalli 1995). An example are dream
   characters who are identified not by their behavior or looks, but by
   just knowing (Kahn et al. 2000, 2002; Revonsuo & Tarkko 2002). Dreams
   are also attention-dependent and lack foreground-background structure
   (Thompson 2014); while it is tempting to construe the dream world as
   rich in detail, there is no more to dreams than meets the eye, and many
   think dream experience is exhausted by what is the focus of selective
   attention (Hunter 1983; Thompson 2014).

   Indeterminacy is also related to the question of whether we dream in
   color or in black and white. Based on a review of historical and recent
   studies, Schwitzgebel (2002, 2011) argues there has been a shift in
   theories on dream color that coincides with the rise first of
   black-and-white and then color television. He argues it is unlikely
   that dreams themselves changed from colored to black and white and back
   to colored, proposing that a change in opinion is a more plausible
   explanation. Maybe dreams were either black and white or colored all
   along; or maybe they are indeterminate with respect to color, as may be
   the case for imagined or fictional objects; were this the case, it
   would strengthen the imagination view (Ichikawa 2009). Schwitzgebel's
   main point is that reports of colored dreaming are unreliable and our
   opinions about dreams can be mistaken (but see Windt 2013, 2015a). This
   relates to Schwitzgebel's (2011; Hurlburt & Schwitzgebel 2007) general
   skepticism about the reliability of introspection.

   The issue of dream color has led to a number of follow-up studies
   (Schwitzgebel 2003; Schwitzgebel et al. 2006; Murzyn 2008; Schredl et
   al. 2008; Hoss 2010). They suggest most people dream in color and a
   small percentage describe grayscale or even mixed dreams (Murzyn 2008)
   or dreams involving moderate color saturation (Rechtschaffen and
   Buchignani 1992). Indeterminacy is rarely reported.

   The imagination view has consequences for Cartesian dream skepticism.
   If dream pain does not feel like real pain, there is a fail-safe way to
   determine whether one is now dreaming: one need only pinch oneself
   (Nelson 1966; Stone 1984; but see Hodges & Carter 1969; Kantor 1970).
   As Locke put it,

     if our dreamer pleases to try, whether the glowing heat of a glass
     furnace, be barely a wandering imagination in a drowsy man's fancy,
     by putting his hand into it, he may perhaps be wakened into a
     certainty greater than he could wish, that it is something more than
     bare imagination. (Locke 1689: IV.XI.8)

   If dreaming feels different from waking, this raises the question why
   we tend to describe dreams in the same terms as waking perception.
   Maybe this is because most people haven't thought about these matters
   and they would find the imagination view plausible if they considered
   it (Ichikawa 2009). Or maybe

     it is just because we all know that dreams are throughout unlike
     waking experiences that we can safely use ordinary expressions in
     the narration of them. (Austin 1962: 42)

   Some authors classify dreams as imaginings while acknowledging they
   feel like perceiving. For example, Hobbes describes dreams as "the
   imaginations of them that sleep" (Hobbes 1651: 90), and imagination as
   a "decaying sense" (Hobbes 1651: 88). Yet he also uses the concepts of
   imagination and fancy to describe perception and argues "their
   appearance to us is Fancy, the same waking, that dreaming" (Hobbes
   1651: 86).

   In the scientific literature, the imagination view is complemented by
   cognitive theories. Foulkes (1978: 5) describes dreaming as a form of
   thinking with its own grammar and syntax, but allows that dream imagery
   is sufficently perception-like to deceive us. Domhoff's neurocognitive
   model of dreaming (2001, 2003) emphasizes the dependence of dreaming on
   visuospatial skills and on a network including the association areas of
   the forebrain. The theory draws from findings on the partial or global
   cessation of dreaming following brain lesions (cf. Solms 1997, 2000),
   evidence that dreaming develops gradually and in tandem with
   visuospatial skills in children (Foulkes 1993a, 1999; but see Resnick
   et al. 1994), and results from dream content analysis supporting the
   continuity of dreaming with waking concerns and memories (the so-called
   continuity hypothesis; see Domhoff 2001, 2003; Schredl & Hofmann 2003;
   Schredl 2006; see also Nir & Tononi 2010).

2.7 Dreaming and waking mind wandering

   A number of researchers have begun to consider dreaming in the context
   of theories of mind wandering. Mind wandering is frequent in waking and
   involves spontaneous thoughts that unfold dynamically and are only
   weakly constrained by ongoing tasks and environmental demands (Schooler
   et al. 2011; Smallwood & Schooler 2015; Christoff et al. 2016). Based
   on phenomenological and neurophysiological similarities, dreams have
   been proposed to be an intensified form of waking mind wandering
   (Pace-Schott 2007, 2013; Domhoff 2011; Wamsley 2013; Fox et al. 2013).
   This basic idea seems to have been anticipated by Leibniz, who noted
   that the spontaneous formation of visions in dreams surpasses the
   capacity of our waking imagination (Leibniz, Philosophical Papers and
   Letters, Vol. I, 177-178).

   The analogy between dreams and waking mind wandering has been discussed
   in the context of cognitive agency. Metzinger (2013a,b, 2015) describes
   dreams and waking mind wandering as involving a cyclically recurring
   loss of mental autonomy, or the ability to deliberately control one's
   conscious thought processes. Dreams and waking mind wandering are not
   mental actions but unintentional mental behaviors, comparable to
   subpersonal processes such as breathing or heartbeat. Because dreaming
   and waking mind wandering make up a the majority of our conscious
   mental lives, he argues that cognitive agency and mental autonomy are
   the exception, not the rule.

   This raises the question of how to make sense of lucid control dreams,
   which involve both meta-awareness and agency. Windt and Voss (2018)
   argue that in such cases, spontaneous processes including imagery
   formation co-exist alongside more deliberate, top-down control; they
   also argue metacognitive insight and control themselves can have
   spontaneous elements. This suggests spontaneity and control are not
   opposites, but a more complex account is needed. Possibly, certain
   dreams and instances of waking mind wandering can be both spontaneous
   and agentive.

   The analogy with mind wandering might help move forward the debate on
   the ontology of dreaming. In this debate, a common assumption is that
   dreams can be categorized as either hallucinatory or imaginative. Yet
   the application of these terms to dreams quickly runs into
   counterexamples and it is unclear they are mutually exclusive. One
   option is pluralism (Rosen 2018b), in which some aspects of dreaming
   are hallucinatory, others imaginative, and yet again others illusory.
   Another is that dreams are sui generis, combining aspects associated
   with wake states such as hallucinating, imagining, or perceiving in a
   novel manner without mimicking them completely. Windt (2015a) proposes
   that mind wandering, which describes a range of mental states loosely
   characterized by their spontaneous and dynamic character, might be
   particularly suitable for the characterization of dreaming precisely
   because that term leaves open more specific questions on the
   phenomenology of dreaming, allowing for variation in control,
   determinacy, and so on. This might be a good starting point for
   describing what is unique about dreaming while also acknowledging
   continuities across sleep-wake states and capitalizing on the strengths
   of the hallucination, illusion, imagination, and cognitive views.

2.8 The problem of dream belief

   The second strand of the imagination view argues that dream beliefs are
   not real beliefs, but propositional imaginings. This may or may not be
   combined with the claim that dream imagery is imaginative rather than
   perceptual (Sosa 2007; Ichikawa 2009).

   Denying that dream beliefs have the status of real beliefs only makes
   sense before the background of a specific account of what beliefs are
   and how they are distinguished from other mental states such as
   delusions or propositional imaginings. For instance, Ichikawa (2009)
   argues that if we follow interpretationist or dispositionalist accounts
   of belief, dream beliefs fall short of real beliefs. He claims dream
   beliefs lack connection with perceptual experience and fail to motivate
   actions; consequently, they do not have the same functional role as
   real beliefs. Moreover, we cannot ascribe dream beliefs to a person by
   observing them lying asleep in bed. Dream beliefs are often
   inconsistent with longstanding waking beliefs and acquired and
   discarded without any process of belief revision (Ichikawa 2009).

   This analysis of dream beliefs has consequences for skepticism. If
   dream beliefs are propositional imaginings, then we do not falsely
   believe while dreaming that we are now awake, but only imagine that we
   do (Sosa 2007). It is not clear though that this protects us from
   deception. If dream beliefs fall short of real beliefs, this might even
   make the specter of dream deception more worrisome: in mistaking dream
   beliefs for the real thing, we would now be deceived about the status
   of our own mental states (Ichikawa 2008).

   It is also not clear whether the same type of argument extends to
   mental states other than beliefs. As Lewis points out, a person might

     in fact believe or realize in the course of a dream that he was
     dreaming, and even if we said that, in such case, he only dreamt
     that he was dreaming, this still leaves it possible for someone who
     is asleep to entertain at the time the thought that he is asleep.
     (Lewis 1969: 133)

   Mental states other than believing such as entertaining, thinking, or
   minimally appraisive instances of taking for granted might be
   sufficient for deception (Reed 1979).

   The debate about dream beliefs is paralleled by a debate about whether
   delusions are beliefs or imaginings (see Currie 2000; Currie &
   Ravenscroft 2002; McGinn 2004; Bayne & Pacherie 2005; Bortolotti 2009;
   Gendler 2013). Both debates might plausibly inform each other,
   especially as dreams are sometimes proposed to be delusional (Hobson
   1999).

3. Dreaming and theories of consciousness

3.1 Dreaming as a model system and test case for consciousness research

   Dreams are a global state of consciousness in which experience arises
   under altered behavioral and neurophysiological conditions as compared
   to standard wakefulness; unlike other altered states of consciousness
   (such as drug-induced or deep meditative states) and pathological wake
   states (such as psychosis or neurological syndromes), dreams occur
   spontaneously and regularly in healthy subjects. For both reasons, many
   regard dreams as a test case for theories of consciousness or even an
   ideal model system for consciousness research (Churchland 1988;
   Revonsuo 2006).

   Existing proposals differ on the phenomenology of dreaming: referring
   to dream bizarreness, Churchland describes dream experience as robustly
   different from waking, whereas Revonsuo argues dreaming is similar to
   waking and the purest form of experience:

     the dreaming brain brings out the phenomenal level of organization
     in a clear and distinct form. Dreaming is phenomenality pure and
     simple, untouched by external physical stimulation or behavioural
     activity. (Revonsuo 2006: 75)

   Revonsuo argues dreaming reveals the basic, state-independent structure
   of consciousness to be immersive: "dreaming depicts consciousness first
   and foremost as a subjective world-for-me" (Revonsuo 2006: 75). This
   leads him to introduce the "world-simulation metaphor of
   consciousness", according to which consciousness itself is essentially
   simulational and dreamlike. This is taken to support internalism about
   conscious experience.

   This latter claim is also contentious. Noë (2004: 213) argues that
   phenomenological differences between dreaming and waking (such as
   greater instability of visual dream imagery) result from the lack of
   dynamic interaction with the environment in dreams. He proposes this
   shows that neural states are sufficient for dreaming but denies they
   are also sufficient for perceptual experience.

   A possible problem for both views is their reliance on background
   assumptions about the phenomenology of dreaming and its disconnection
   from environmental stimuli and bodily sensations. Windt (2015a, 2018)
   argues both internalism and externalism mistakenly assume dreams to be
   isolated from external sensory input and own-body perception; she
   believes both the phenomenology of dreaming and its correlation with
   external stimuli are complex and variable. She argues the analysis of
   dreaming does not clearly support either side in the debate on
   internalism vs externalism (but see Rosen 2018a). Generally, in the
   absence of a well worked out theory of dreaming and its sleep-stage and
   neural correlates, proposals for using dreaming as a model system or
   test case run the risk of relying on an oversimplified description of
   the target phenomenon (Windt & Noreika 2011).

   Recent accounts appealing to generative models and predictive
   processing (Clark 2013b; Hohwy 2013) suggest a new, unified account of
   perception, imagination, and dreaming. In these accounts, different
   mental states, including perception and action, embody different
   strategies of hypothesis testing and prediction error minimization.
   Perception is the attempt to model the hidden external causes of
   sensory stimuli; action involves keeping the internal model stable
   while changing the sensory input. Clark argues that on such a model,

     systems that know how to perceive an object as a cat are thus
     systems that, ipso facto, are able to use a top-down cascade to
     bring about the kinds of activity pattern that would be
     characteristic of the presence of a cat. [...] Perceivers like us,
     if this is correct, are inevitably potential dreamers and imaginers
     too. Moreover, they are beings who, in dreaming and imagining, are
     deploying many of the very same strategies and resources used in
     ordinary perception. (Clark 2013a: 764)

   Predictive processing accounts have also been used to explain specific
   features of dreaming. Bizarreness has been associated with the
   comparative lack of external stimulus processing, implying dream
   imagery is relatively unconstrained by prediction errors (cf. Hobson &
   Friston 2012; Fletcher & Frith 2008; Bucci & Grasso 2017). Windt (2018)
   suggests a predictive processing account of dream imagery generation
   that links bodily self-experience to own-body perception and subtle
   motor behaviors such as twitching in REM sleep (Blumberg 2010; Blumberg
   & Plumeau 2016). She argues that movement sensations in dreams, in
   relation to REM-sleep related muscle twitching, involve a form of
   bodily self-sampling in which coordinated muscular activity contributes
   to the generation and maintenance of a body model. This is important
   because in predictive processing accounts neither the bodily nor the
   external causes of sensory inputs are known; at the same time, having
   an accurate body model is a prerequisite for action, requiring the
   system to disambiguate between self- and other generated changes to
   sensory inputs. Especially in early development, sleep might provide
   the ideal conditions for exploring one's own body via subtle but
   coordinated muscular activity while processing of visual and auditory
   stimuli is reduced.

   Dreams have also been suggested as a test case for whether phenomenal
   consciousness can be divorced from cognitive access (e.g., Block 2007;
   but see Cohen & Dennett 2011). Sebastián (2014a) argues that dreams
   provide empirical evidence that conscious experience can occur
   independently of cognitive access. This is because during (non-lucid)
   REM-sleep dreams, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) as the
   most plausible mechanism underlying cognitive access is selectively
   deactivated (see also Pantani et al. 2018). This would challenge
   theories linking conscious experience to access, such as
   higher-order-thought theory (Sebastián 2014b). However, both the
   hypoactivation of the dlPCF in REM sleep and its association with
   cognitive access have been debated. Fazekas and Nemeth (2018) suggest
   that certain kinds of cognitive access may be independent of dlPFC
   activation, necessitating a more complex account.

3.2 Dreams, psychosis, and delusions

   Dreaming has been suggested as a model system not just of waking
   consciousness in general, but also of psychotic wake states in
   particular. The analogy between dreaming and madness has a long
   philosophical history (Plato, Phaedrus; Kant 1766; Schopenhauer 1847)
   and finds particularly stark expression in Hobson's claim that
   "dreaming is not a model of a psychosis. It is a psychosis. It's just a
   healthy one" (Hobson 1999: 44). Gottesmann (2006) proposes dreaming as
   a neurophysiological model of schizophrenia. There is a rich discussion
   on the theoretical and methodological implications of dream research
   for psychiatry (see Scarone et al. 2007; d'Agostino et al. 2013; see
   Windt & Noreika 2011 as well as the other papers in this special issue)
   and a number of studies have investigated differences in dream reports
   from schizophrenic and healthy subjects (Limosani et al. 2011a,b).

   Rather than likening dreaming to waking in general or specific wake
   states such as psychosis, there have also been attempts to compare
   specific dream phenomena to wake-state delusions. Gerrans (2012, 2013,
   2014) focuses on character misidentification in dreams and delusions of
   hyperfamiliarity (such as the Frégoli delusion, in which strangers are
   mistakenly identified as family members, and déjà vu) to argue that
   anomalous experience and faulty reality testing both play a role in
   delusion formation. Rosen (2015) analyzes instances of thought
   insertion and of auditory hallucinations, which are key symptoms of
   schizophrenia, to raise broader questions about the altered sense of
   agency in dreams as compared to waking.

3.3 Beyond dreams: Dreamless sleep experience and the concepts of sleep,
waking, and consciousness

   Philosophers have focused almost exclusively on dreaming, largely
   leaving to the side questions about dreamless sleep including whether
   it is uniformly unconscious. In recent years there has been a surge of
   interest in the possibility of dreamless sleep experience and
   foundational issues about the definition of sleep and waking. This has
   been paralleled by growing interest in dreaming in NREM sleep.

   Conceptually, interest in dreamless sleep experience has been
   facilitated by the precise definition of dreaming offered by simulation
   views (Revonsuo et al. 2015). If dreams are immersive sleep experiences
   characterized by their here-and-now structure, it makes sense to ask
   whether this is true for all or just a subset of sleep-related
   experiences and whether non-immersive sleep experiences exist. By
   contrast, if dreaming is broadly identified with any conscious
   mentation in sleep (Pagel et al. 2001), there is no conceptual space
   for dreamless sleep experience.

   Following Thompson's (2014, 2015) discussion of dreamless sleep in
   Indian and Buddhist philosophy, Windt and colleagues (2016; see also
   Windt 2015b) introduce a framework for different kinds of dreamless
   sleep experience ranging from thinking and isolated imagery,
   perception, or bodily sensations, where these lack integration into a
   scene, to minimal kinds of experience lacking imagery or specific
   thought contents. A possible example of minimal phenomenal experience
   in sleep are white dreams, where people report having had experiences
   during sleep but cannot remember any details. Taken at face value, some
   white dream reports might describe experiences that lack reportable
   content (Windt 2015b); others might describe forgotten dreams or dreams
   with degraded content (Fazekas et al. 2018). Another example are
   reports of witnessing dreamless sleep, as described in certain
   meditation practices. This state is said to involve non-conceptual
   awareness of sleep, again in the absence of imagery or specific thought
   contents, and loss of sense of self (Thompson 2014, 2015). Some schools
   in Buddhist philosophy explain claims of deep and dreamless sleep by
   saying we never fully lose consciousness in sleep (Prasad 2000, 66; and
   Thompson 2014, 2015).

   Empirically, interest in dreamless sleep experience is paralleled by
   increasing interest in experiences in NREM sleep (Fazekas et al. 2018).
   Most researchers now accept that dreaming is not confined to REM sleep,
   but also occurs at sleep onset and in NREM sleep. The deeper stages of
   NREM sleep are particularly interesting as they involve roughly similar
   proportions of dreaming, unconscious sleep, and white dreams (Noreika
   et al. 2009: Siclari et al. 2013, 2017). In the search for the neural
   correlates of dreaming vs unconscious dreamless sleep, this makes
   comparisons within the same sleep stage possible and avoids confounds
   involved in comparing presumably dreamful REM sleep with presumably
   dreamless NREM sleep. Findings suggest that activity in the same
   parietal hot zone underlies dreaming in both NREM and REM sleep
   (Siclari et al. 2017).

   Where sleep and dream research have traditionally tried to identify the
   sleep stage correlates of dreaming, newer research suggests local
   changes occurring independently of sleep stages might in fact be more
   relevant. Traditionally regarded as global, whole-brain phenomena,
   there is now increasing evidence that sleep itself is locally driven,
   and local changes in sleep depth might be associated with changes in
   sleep-related experience (Siclari & Tononi 2017; Andrillon et al.
   2019). While sleep and dream research are often considered as separate
   fields, changes in how sleep in general and sleep stages in particular
   are defined appear closely associated with changes in the theoretical
   conception of dreaming and its empirical investigation.

   Historically, discoveries about dreaming have precipitated changing
   conceptions of sleep (for an excellent history of the study of sleep
   and dreaming, see Kroker 2007). Following Aristotle (On Sleeping and
   Waking), sleep was traditionally defined in negative terms as the
   absence of wakefulness and perception. This is still reflected in
   Malcolm's assumption that "to a person who is sound asleep, `dead to
   the world', things cannot even seem" (Malcolm 1956: 26). With the
   discovery of REM sleep, sleep came to be regarded as a heterogeneous
   phenomenon characterized by the cyclic alteration of different sleep
   stages. REM sleep was now considered as "neither sleeping nor waking.
   It was obviously a third state of the brain, as different from sleep as
   sleep is from wakefulness" (Jouvet 1999: 5). The folk-psychological
   dichotomy between sleep and wakefulness now seemed oversimplified and
   empirically implausible. At the same time dreaming, which had
   previously been considered as an intermediate state of half-sleeping
   and half-waking, came to be regarded as a genuine sleep phenomenon, but
   narrowed to REM sleep. Today, the framework for describing dreams and
   other sleep-related experiences is more precise, but dreaming has also
   been cast adrift from REM sleep.

   A closely associated issue is how to define waking. Crowther's (2018)
   capacitation thesis casts waking consciousness as a state in which the
   individual is fully switched on to their environment, but also to their
   own epistemic (cf. O'Shaugnessy 2002) and agentive potential; the
   waking individual is empowered to act and think in certain ways, though
   this potential need not be actualized. By contrast, dreaming is an
   "imagining-of consciousness" (O'Shaughnessy 2002: 430) and
   consciousness is conceptually tied to wakefulness. Because in lucid
   dreams, the epistemic and agentive profile of waking is at least partly
   realized, they might, according to Crowther, be regarded as closer to
   waking than nonlucid dreams.

   This account of waking and sleep may also have consequences for the
   imagination model of dreaming and dream skepticism (Soteriou 2017). As
   in the imagination model, dreaming would be passive and action,
   including cognitive agency, would be tied to waking. If dreaming
   nonetheless involved passive episodes of imagining oneself to be
   active, one would be unable to tell that one were dreaming and
   imagining, as this insight would require the exercise of real agency.
   The sceptical consequence would be that when dreaming, one would lose
   agency as well as the capacity to gain insight into one's current
   state. Yet our ability to know we are waking when waking would be
   unscathed; according to Soteriou, waking would thus have an epistemic
   function connected to the capacity to exercise agency over our mental
   lives.

   Finally, definitions of consciousness themselves are bound up with
   conceptions of sleep and dreaming. As dreaming went from a state whose
   experiential status was doubted to being widely recognized as a second
   global state of consciousness, consciousness sometimes came to be
   defined contrastively as that which disappears in deep, dreamless sleep
   and reappears in waking and dreaming (Searle 2000; Tononi 2008). In
   light of dreamless sleep experience, such definitions are problematic
   (Thompson 2014, 2015; Windt 2015b; Windt et al. 2016). Dreamless sleep
   experience has been proposed to be particularly relevant for
   understanding minimal phenomenal experience, or the conditions under
   which the simplest kind of conscious experience arises (Windt 2015b).
   The investigation of dreamless sleep might thus shed light on the
   transition from unconscious sleep to sleep-related experience.

4. Dreaming and the self

   We almost always have a self in dreams, though this self can sometimes
   be a slightly different (e.g. older or younger) version of our waking
   self or even a different person entirely. Dreams therefore raise
   interesting questions about the identity between the dream and waking
   self. Locke (1689) invites us to imagine two men alternating in turns
   between sleep and wakefulness and sharing one continuously thinking
   soul (Locke 1689: II.I.12). He argues that if one man retained no
   memory of the soul's thoughts and perceptions while it was linked to
   the other man's body, they would be distinct persons. His position is
   that personal identity depends on psychological continuity, including
   recall: in the absence of recall, as illustrated by the toy example of
   two people sharing one soul, continuous conscious thinking does not
   suffice for identity. Locke also rejects the possibility of unrecalled
   dreams and the idea that we dream throughout sleep, remembering only a
   small proportion of our dreams (Locke 1689: II.I.19).

   Valberg distinguishes between the subject of the dream (i.e., the dream
   self) and the sleeping person who is the dreamer of the dream and
   recalls it upon awakening (Valberg 2007). He argues that awakening from
   a dream involves crossing a chasm between discrete worlds with discrete
   spaces and times; it does not make sense to say that "the `I' at these
   times [is] a single individual who crosses from one world to the other"
   (Valberg 2007: 69). According to Valberg, this is relevant to dream
   skepticism because there is no simple way to make sense of the claims
   that it is I who emerge from a dream or that I was the victim of dream
   deception.

   Vicarious dreams, or dreams in which the protagonist of the dream seems
   to be a different person from the dreamer, are particularly puzzling
   with respect to identity. They may even raise the question of whether
   the dream self has an independent existence (Rosen & Sutton 2013:
   1047). Such dreams are superficially similar to cases in which we
   imagine being another person, but according to Rosen and Sutton require
   a different explanation: in the case of dreaming, the imagined person's
   thoughts are not framed as diverging from one's own and one does not
   retain one's own perspective in addition to the imagined one; in
   nonlucid dreams, only the perspective of the dream's protagonist is
   retained.

   The dream self is also at the center of simulation views of dreaming,
   which define dreaming via its immersive, here and now character as the
   experience of a self in a world. This leads to further questions about
   the phenomenology of self-experience in dreams and how it is different
   from waking self-experience. Different versions of the simulation view
   focus on different aspects of self- and world experience in dreams,
   ranging from social simulation (Revonsuo et al. 2015) to the typical
   features of selfhood in dreams (Revonsuo 2005, 2006, Metzinger 2003,
   2009) to the minimal conditions for experiencing oneself as a self in
   dreams and what this tells us about minimal phenomenal selfhood in
   general (Windt 2015a, 2018). Yet these different versions of the
   simulation view are largely complementary and together have forged
   unity in a field that was previously hampered by lack of agreement
   about the definition of dreaming. They also integrate the philosophy of
   dreaming and scientific dream research.

   As so often in debates about dreaming, there is disagreement about
   basic phenomenological questions. Revonsuo (2005) describes
   self-experience including bodily experience in dreams as identical to
   waking, whereas Metzinger (2003, 2009; see also Windt & Metzinger 2007)
   argues that important layers of waking self-experience (such as
   autobiographical memory, agency, a stable first-person perspective,
   metacognitive insight, and self-knowledge) are missing in nonlucid
   dreams. He argues this is due to the cognitive and mnemonic deficit
   that characterizes nonlucid dreams (cf. Hobson et al. 2000). Windt
   (2015a) analyzes the range of cognitive and bodily self-experience in
   dreams, both of which she describes as variable. She argues that in a
   majority of cases, dreams are weakly phenomenally embodied states in
   which bodily experience is largely related to movement sensations but a
   detailed and integrated body representation is lacking; instead, bodily
   experience in dreams is largely indeterminate (for an attempt to test
   this empirically, see Koppehele-Gossel et al. 2016). She proposes this
   is because dreams are also weakly functionally embodied states, in
   which the specific pattern of bodily experience reflects altered
   processing of bodily sensations (as in the illusion view). She also
   analyzes instances of bodiless dreams, in which dreamers say they
   experienced themselves as disembodied entities, to argue that
   self-experience can be reduced to pure spatiotemporal-self-location
   (Windt 2010); she proposes these cases can help identify the conditions
   for the emergence of minimal phenomenal selfhood (Blanke & Metzinger
   2009; see also Metzinger 2013b).

5. Immorality and moral responsibility in dreams

   How the phenomenology of dreaming compares to waking and what to say
   about how the dream self relates to the waking self bears on questions
   about the moral status of dreams. For Augustine (Confessions) dreams
   were a cause of moral concern because of their indistinguishability
   from waking life. What particularly worried him about dreams of sexual
   acts was their vividness, as well as the feeling of pleasure and
   seeming acquiescence or consent on the part of the dreamer. He
   concluded, however, that the transition from sleep to wakefulness
   involves a radical chasm, enabling the dreamer to awaken with a clear
   conscience and absolving them from taking responsibility for their
   dream actions.

   What exactly Augustine thought the chasm between dreaming and waking
   consists in allows for different interpretations (Matthews 1981).
   Firstly, if the dream and waking self are not identical, then waking
   Augustine is not morally responsible for dream-Augustine's actions.
   Secondly, actions performed in dreams might be morally irrelevant
   because they did not really happen. And thirdly, assuming that moral
   responsibility requires the ability to act otherwise, dreams provide no
   grounds for moral concern because we cannot refrain from having certain
   types of dreams.

   The issue of dream immorality may also present a choice point between
   different accounts of moral evaluation. Where internalists assume the
   moral status of a person's actions is entirely determined by internal
   factors such as intentions and motives, externalists look beyond these
   to the effects of actions. Driver (2007) argues that the absurdity of
   dream immorality itself should count against purely internalist
   accounts; yet she also acknowledges this absurdity is not a necessary
   feature of dreams.

   Central to the question of dream immorality is the status of dreams as
   actions rather than mere behaviors. Mullane (1965) argues that while we
   don't have full control over our dreams, they are not completely
   involuntary either; as is the case for blushing, considerable effort is
   required to attain control over our dreams and in some cases they can
   even be considered as actions. That lucid dream control is, to some
   extent, a learnable skill (Stumbrys et al. 2014) lends some support to
   this claim.

6. The meaning of dreams and the functions of dreaming

6.1 The meaning of dreams

   Philosophical discussions of dreaming tend to focus on (a) dream
   deception and (b) questions about the ontology of dreaming, its moral
   status, etc., that tend to intersect with dream skepticism. By
   contrast, the main source of interest in dreams outside of philosophy
   traditionally has been dream interpretation and whether dreams are a
   source of knowledge and insight. Historically, the epistemic status of
   dreams and the use of prophetic and diagnostic dreams was not just a
   theoretical, but a practical problem (Barbera 2008). Different types of
   dreams were distinguished by their putative epistemic value.
   Artemidorus, for instance, used the term enhypnion to refer to dreams
   that merely reflect the sleeper's current bodily or psychological state
   and hence do not merit further interpretation, whereas he reserved the
   term oneiron for meaningful and symbolic dreams of divine origin.

   The practice of dream interpretation was famously attacked by Aristotle
   in On Prophecy in Sleep. He denied that dreams are of divine origin,
   but allowed that occasionally, small affections of the sensory organs
   as might stem from distant events that cannot be perceived in waking
   are perceptible in the quiet of sleep. He also believed such dreams
   were mostly likely to occur in dullards whose minds resemble an empty
   desert - an assessment that was not apt to encourage interest in dreams
   (Kroker 2007: 37). A similarly negative view was held by early modern
   philosophers who believed dreams were often the source of superstitious
   beliefs (Hobbes 1651; Kant 1766; Schopenhauer 1847).

   In Freudian dream theory, dream interpretation once more assumed a
   prominent role as the royal road to knowledge of the unconscious. This
   was associated with claims about the psychic sources of dreaming. Freud
   (1899) also rejected the influence of external or bodily sources, as
   championed by contemporary proponents of somatic-stimulus theory.

   In the neuroscience of dreaming, Hobson famously argued that dreams are
   the product of the random, brain-stem driven activation of the brain
   during sleep (Hobson 1988) and at best enable personal insights in the
   same way as a Rorschach test (Hobson et al. 2000). Dennett (1991)
   illustrates the lack of design underlying the production of dream
   narratives through the "party game of psychoanalysis", which involves
   an aimless game of question-and-answer. In the game, players follow
   simple rules to jointly produce narratives that can seem symbolic and
   meaningful, even though no intelligent and deliberate process of
   narration was involved.

   Even if we grant that dreams are not messages from a hidden entity in
   need of decoding, this does not imply that dream interpretation cannot
   be a personally meaningful source of insight and creativity (Hobson &
   Wohl 2005). Whether and under which conditions, and following which
   methods, dream interpretation can lead to personally significant
   insights is an empirical question that is only beginning to be
   investigated systematically (see Edwards et al. 2013).

   Finally, throughout history, views on the epistemic status of dreams
   and the type of knowledge to be gained from dream interpretation (e.g.,
   knowledge about the future, diagnosis of physical illness, or insights
   about one's current concerns) often changed in tandem with views on the
   origin and sources of dreaming, which gradually moved from divine
   origins and external sources, via the body, to the unconscious, and
   finally to the brain.

6.2 The functions of dreaming

   Different theories on the functions of dreaming have been proposed and
   the debate is ongoing. An important distinction is between the
   functions of sleep stages and the functions of dreaming.
   Well-documented functions of REM sleep include thermoregulation and the
   development of cortical structures in birds and mammals, as well as
   neurotransmitter repletion, the reconstruction and maintenance of
   little-used brain circuits, the structural development of the brain in
   early developmental phases, as well as the preparation of a repertoire
   of reflexive or instinctive behaviors (Hobson 2009). Yet none of these
   functions are obviously linked to dreaming. An exception is
   protoconsciousness theory, in which REM sleep plays an important role
   in foetal development by providing a virtual world model even before
   the emergence of full-blown consciousness (Hobson 2009: 808).

   Numerous studies have investigated the contribution of sleep to memory
   consolidation, with different sleep stages promoting different types of
   memories (Diekelmann et al. 2009; Walker 2009). However, only a few
   studies have investigated the relationship between dream content and
   memory consolidation in sleep (for a review, see Nielsen & Stenstrom
   2005). Dreams rarely involve episodic replay of waking memories (Fosse
   et al. 2003). The incorporation of memory sources seems to follow a
   specific temporal pattern in which recent memories are integrated with
   older but semantically related memories (Blagrove et al. 2011). Nielsen
   (2017) presents a model of how external and bodily stimuli on one hand
   and short- and long-term memories on the other hand form seemingly
   novel, complex, and dreamlike images at sleep onset; he proposes these
   microdreams shed light on the formation and sources of more complex
   dreams. There is also some evidence that dream imagery might be
   associated with memory consolidation and task performance after sleep,
   though this is preliminary (Wamsley & Stickgold 2009, 2010; Wamsley et
   al. 2010).

   Prominent theories on the function of dreaming focus on bad dreams and
   nightmares. It has long been thought that dreaming contributes to
   emotional processing and that this is particularly obvious in the
   dreams of nightmare sufferers or in dreams following traumatic
   experiences (e.g., Hartmann 1998; Nielsen & Lara-Carrasco 2007; Levin &
   Nielsen 2009; Cartwright 2010; Perogamvros et al. 2013). Based on the
   high prevalence of negative emotions and threatening dream content,
   threat simulation theory suggests that the evolutionary function of
   dreaming lies in the simulation of ancestral threats and the rehearsal
   of threatening events and avoidance skills in dreams has an adaptive
   value by enhancing the individual's chances of survival (see Revonsuo
   2000; Valli 2008). A more recent proposal is social simulation theory,
   in which social imagery in dreams supports social cognition, bonds, and
   social skills. (Revonsuo et al. 2015).

   An evolutionary perspective can also be fruitfully applied to specific
   aspects of dream phenomenology. According to the vigilance hypothesis,
   natural selection disfavored the occurrence of those types of
   sensations during sleep that would compromise vigilance (Symons 1993).
   Dream sounds, but also smells or pains might distract attention from
   the potentially dangerous surroundings of the sleeping subject, and the
   vigilance hypothesis predicts that they only rarely occur in dreams
   without causing awakening. By contrast, because most mammals sleep with
   their eyes closed and in an immobile position, vivid visual and
   movement hallucinations during sleep would not comprise vigilance and
   thus can occur in dreams without endangering the sleeping subject.
   Focusing on the stuff dreams are not made of might then be at least as
   important for understanding the function of dreaming as developing a
   positive account.

   Finally, even if dreaming in general and specific types of dream
   content in particular were found to be strongly associated with
   specific cognitive functions, it would still be possible that dreams
   are mere epiphenomena of brain activity during sleep (Flanagan 1995,
   2000). It is also possible that the function of dreams is not knowable
   (Springett 2019).

   A particular problem for any theory on the function of dreaming is to
   explain why a majority of dreams are forgotten and how dreams can
   fulfill their putative function independently of recall. Crick and
   Mitchinson (1983) famously proposed that REM sleep "erases" or deletes
   surplus information and unnecessary memories, which would suggest that
   enhanced dream recall is counterproductive. Another problem is that
   dreaming can be lost selectively and independently of other cognitive
   deficits (Solms 1997, 2000).

   Some of the problems that arise for theories on the functions of
   dreaming can be avoided if we do not assume that dreaming has a
   specific function, separate from the function(s) of conscious wakeful
   states. This depends on the broader taxonomy of dreaming in relation to
   wakeful states. For example, if dreaming is continuous with waking mind
   wandering, imagination, and/or own-body perception, we should not
   expect it to have a unique function, but rather to express a similar
   function as these wakeful states, perhaps to varying degrees. Nor
   should we expect dreams to have a single function; the functions of
   dreaming might be as varied and complex as those of consciousness, and
   given the complexity of the target phenomenon, the failure to pin down
   a single function should not be surprising (Windt 2015a).

7. Conclusions

   Questions about dreaming in different areas of philosophy such as
   epistemology, ontology, philosophy of mind and cognitive science, and
   ethics are closely intertwined. Scientific evidence from sleep and
   dream research can meaningfully inform the philosophical discussion and
   has often done so in the past. The discussion of dreaming has also
   often functioned as a lens on broader questions about knowledge,
   morality, consciousness, and self. Long a marginalized area, the
   philosophy of dreaming and of sleep is central to important
   philosophical questions and increasingly plays an important role in
   interdisciplinary consciousness research, for example in the search for
   the neural correlates of conscious states, in conscious state
   taxonomies, and in research on the minimal conditions for phenomenal
   selfhood and conscious experience.

   Key Takeaways
     * Lucid dreams occur when the sleeper is aware that they are in a
       dream and can exercise some control over their environment.
     * Various approaches can stimulate lucid dreaming and help train a
       person to lucid dream.
     * Frequent lucid dreams might decrease sleep quality or affect one's
       mental health.

   About 55% of people have realized they were dreaming in the middle of a
   dream Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information
   The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and
   health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information. View
   Source . The experience of recognizing that you're dreaming in the
   moment is called lucid dreaming. When people lucid dream, they can
   sometimes control what happens next, so they do things they wish they
   could do in real life, such as fly through the air like a superhero,
   spend time with a deceased loved one, or travel across the world.

   People who spontaneously lucid dream are often interested in finding
   ways to lucid dream again. Those who haven't had a lucid dream may be
   interested in having one for the first time. Researchers have found
   multiple ways to potentially induce lucid dreaming, though the practice
   can come with risks.

What Is Lucid Dreaming?

   Lucid dreaming is a phenomenon in which a sleeper becomes aware that
   they are dreaming while they are still asleep. In about one-third of
   lucid dreams, the sleeper can influence or control what happens during
   the dream Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech
   Information The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances
   science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic
   information. View Source .

   Lucid dreams are distinct from vivid dreams, which are dreams that a
   person can remember in great detail upon waking Trusted Source UpToDate
   More than 2 million healthcare providers around the world choose
   UpToDate to help make appropriate care decisions and drive better
   health outcomes. UpToDate delivers evidence-based clinical decision
   support that is clear, actionable, and rich with real-world insights.
   View Source . While lucid dreams may be vivid, not all vivid dreams
   involve in-the-moment awareness that one is dreaming.
   "Vivid and lucid dreaming are distinct phenomena. While research is
   ongoing, the potential of lucid dreaming as a mental health
   intervention is intriguing, but it should be approached with
   professional guidance."
   Abhinav Singh, MD, MPH, FAASM
   Abhinav Singh, MD, MPH, FAASM
   Sleep Medicine Physician, MD

   Research indicates that lucid dreaming generally takes place during
   rapid eye movement (REM) sleep--the sleep stage in which most dreaming
   occurs. REM sleep takes place in increasingly long stretches over the
   course of a night, which means that lucid dreams are more likely to
   occur in the second half of a sleep episode Trusted Source StatPearls
   View Source .

   Most people who have lucid dreams describe them as pleasant or even
   blissful experiences. Sleep experts and lucid dreamers have also
   indicated that lucid dreaming can help treat nightmares, reduce anxiety
   and depression, and facilitate creative problem solving.
   Graphic showing approximately 55% of adults have had a lucid dream and
   23% have them one a month.

How to Have a Lucid Dream

   Researchers have found multiple techniques that may help some people
   induce lucid dreaming.
   "Lucid dreaming techniques hold promise, yet they may also lead to
   sleep deprivation. It's essential to consult a sleep specialist to
   understand the benefits and risks before trying these methods."

   Abhinav Singh, MD, MPH, FAASM

Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams (MILD)

   Mnemonic induction of lucid dreams, also known as the MILD technique,
   appears to be one of the most effective methods for bringing on a lucid
   dream Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information
   The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and
   health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information. View
   Source . The MILD technique involves creating an intention to recognize
   when you're dreaming and carrying that intention into the dream state.
   To use the MILD technique, follow these steps:
    1. Upon awakening in the night, try to recall what you've been
       dreaming about or the details of a previous dream you'd like to
       reenter.
    2. Identify signs from the dream that will help you recognize you are
       dreaming if you fall back asleep and successfully reenter the
       dream.
    3. Repeat these words, or your own version of them: "When I begin
       dreaming, I will remember that I'm dreaming."
    4. Continue recalling dream content and repeating that phrase until
       you fall asleep.

   Even though the MILD technique tends to be more effective than many
   others, it leads to a lucid dream in fewer than one in five cases.
   Evidence suggests that the more quickly you fall back asleep after
   waking, the more likely you will be to have a lucid dream when using
   this technique.

Senses Initiated Lucid Dreams (SSILD)

   The Senses Initiated Lucid Dream (SSILD) technique appears to have
   similar success rates to the MILD technique, although it is newer and
   less studied. This method involves focusing on your senses, which could
   make you more likely to notice the transition into the dream world or
   might prime your mind and body for a lucid dream.

   To practice the SSILD technique, cycle through the following steps
   multiple times. First, go through each step quickly for a few cycles.
   Then, cycle through while spending a few seconds on each step. Finally,
   do up to six slow cycles in which you spend 20 seconds in each step
   and, ideally, fall asleep.
    1. Vision: With your eyelids closed and your eyes relaxed and still,
       focus on what you see. It might simply be darkness, or you might
       see colors, shapes, or images. The goal is not to see anything in
       particular but simply to notice what's there.
    2. Hearing: Shift your focus to what you can hear. You might hear
       sounds made by your body, such as your heartbeat or breaths, or you
       might hear external sounds, such as crickets chirping or traffic
       noises. Listen without judging.
    3. Body Sensations: Direct your attention to what your body is
       feeling. You might notice internal sensations, such as muscle
       fatigue or air traveling into your lungs. Or, you might notice
       external sensations, such as the warmth and weight of your
       bedding.

Wake Back To Bed (WBTB)

   Wake Back to Bed (WBTB) is often used in combination with other
   techniques intended to induce lucid dreaming Trusted Source National
   Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center for
   Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing
   access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source . In its most
   basic form, WBTB involves purposely waking up during the night, staying
   awake for a period of time, then returning to sleep Trusted Source
   National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center
   for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing
   access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source . Ideally,
   the sleeper disrupts and later returns to REM sleep, setting the stage
   for a lucid dream Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech
   Information The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances
   science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic
   information. View Source .

   To practice WBTB:
    1. Set an alarm for a point in the night in which you are likely to be
       dreaming but will also have the capacity to fall back asleep. Aim
       to wake at least five hours after going to bed or longer.
    2. Stay awake for between 30 minutes and two hours. To boost your
       chances of having a lucid dream, use this time to practice other
       techniques, such as the MILD technique, the SSILD technique, or
       dream journaling.
    3. Go back to sleep. Some research suggests that an hour is the
       optimal time to wait before returning to sleep, while other
       research indicates you're more likely to have a lucid dream if you
       fall asleep as soon as possible after completing a technique like
       MILD. Experiment with timing to figure out what works for you.

Reality Tests

   Many studies have investigated whether or not the practice of regularly
   conducting "reality tests," also called "reality checks," can induce
   lucid dreams or increase their frequency. This approach is intended to
   help a person build a habit of assessing whether they are awake or
   dreaming, thereby improving the likelihood that they will become aware
   of a dream state. However, there is little evidence to support the
   efficacy of this technique, and users have complained that it can be
   difficult and burdensome.

   Still, studies have not ruled out the possibility that reality tests
   might enhance other techniques, and it's possible that studies haven't
   required participants to use reality tests for long enough to make a
   difference. If you would like to try this technique, select one or more
   of the following reality tests to perform at least 10 times a day while
   you're awake, as well as while you are dreaming, if possible:
     * Ask yourself "Am I dreaming?"
     * Assess your surroundings for signs that you might be dreaming.
     * Try breathing through your mouth with your lips pressed together.
       You will only be able to do so if you're dreaming.
     * Attempt to push your index finger through the palm of the opposite
       hand. If you can, you are dreaming.

Dream Journal

   Some people who have lucid dreams swear by the technique of keeping a
   dream journal, which involves writing down your dreams in as much
   detail as possible as soon as you wake up. Some lucid dreamers say that
   keeping a dream journal trains them to recall their dreams, helps them
   notice "dream signs," and facilitates reality checks.

   While there is little scientific evidence that dream journals help
   induce lucid dreams, dream journals do appear to improve dream recall,
   which may be useful if you practice the MILD technique. Studies have
   also found that some people have lucid dreams after using dream
   journals in combination with other techniques, such as WBTB.

External Stimulation

   A number of devices are marketed as being able to induce lucid dreams
   by providing various kinds of external stimulation Trusted Source
   National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center
   for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing
   access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source . Many of
   these devices are designed to identify or predict when a sleeper has
   transitioned into REM sleep, often by monitoring brain waves or eye
   movement. When this happens, the devices administer sounds, vibrations,
   or blinking lights that are intended to serve as cues to dreamers,
   helping them realize they are dreaming.

   Some devices also provide transcranial alternating current stimulation
   (tACS), delivering electric currents through the scalp to the frontal
   cortex of the brain. This is intended to generate gamma activity in the
   brain, which studies have linked to lucid dreaming Trusted Source
   National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center
   for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing
   access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source Trusted
   Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National
   Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by
   providing access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source .

   Limited evidence suggests that light cues, combined light and sound
   cues, and tACS may increase the likelihood of having a lucid dream .
   More research is needed to verify that external stimulation devices
   live up to their marketing claims.

Dietary Supplements

   A number of studies indicate that a plant-derived drug called
   galantamine can effectively induce lucid dreams. In its prescription
   form, galantamine is used to treat Alzheimer's disease, but it's also
   available as a dietary supplement intended to boost memory and promote
   lucid dreams . Research also indicates that a supplement called
   Alpha-GPC, a form of the nutrient choline, may enhance the
   effectiveness of galantamine.

   Talk to your doctor before taking any dietary supplements. Also, be
   aware that dietary supplements are not regulated like prescription
   drugs, and their contents may not always align with what's written on
   their packaging.

Combine Techniques

   A recent study found using a combination of techniques produced lucid
   dreams on 42% of the nights during the study period, which is the best
   rate of lucid dream induction on record. Based on these findings, some
   experts propose the following steps as the most effective way to induce
   a lucid dream:
    1. Take vitamin B6 before going to bed to boost your body's choline
       levels.
    2. Set an alarm to wake you 5 hours after going to sleep.
    3. After you wake to your alarm, take a combination of galantamine and
       Alpha-GPC.
    4. Practice the MILD technique or the SSILD technique.
    5. Put on a device that provides light stimulation.
    6. Return to sleep as soon as possible.

Is Lucid Dreaming Bad For You?

   While many people view lucid dreams as pleasant and desirable, they can
   be negative experiences for some people. On occasion, they may even
   pose risks to physical and mental health.
     * Sleep loss: Many methods of inducing lucid dreams require a person
       to wake in the night, which disrupts sleep Trusted Source National
       Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center for
       Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing
       access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source .
       Additionally, some people report difficulty falling back asleep or
       poor sleep quality after failed attempts to induce lucid dreams.
       Sleep loss can have serious implications for a person's health and
       wellbeing.
     * Altered sleep architecture: Because the brain behaves differently
       during lucid dreaming than it does during non-lucid REM sleep, some
       experts have expressed concern that lucid dreaming might disrupt
       important processes that ordinarily occur during REM sleep.
     * Sleep paralysis: Some people who induce lucid dreams experience
       sleep paralysis, an intrusion of REM sleep into waking that
       temporarily prevents a person from moving or speaking.
     * Dysphoric dreams: Sometimes, failed attempts to induce a lucid
       dream can lead to nightmares. Moreover, while lucid dreams are
       usually positive experiences, people have reported lucid nightmares
       in which they are aware they are dreaming but unable to escape
       terrifying or horrific dream content.
     * Reality confusion: Some people experience "false awakenings" during
       lucid dreams that lead to confusion about whether they are awake or
       asleep.
     * Dissociative states: For some people, deliberately inducing lucid
       dreams can lead to mental states in which they have trouble
       integrating or controlling their emotions, sense of self,
       understanding of reality, and connection to their bodies Trusted
       Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The
       National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and
       health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information.
       View Source . People with certain mental illnesses may be
       especially vulnerable to this effect.

   Before attempting to induce a lucid dream, it's important to consider
   these risks. If you have any concerns or you plan to use dietary
   supplements, make sure to discuss your plans with a doctor or mental
   health professional.
   "While the study of dreams continues to captivate researchers and the
   general population, conducting large-scale, objective scientific
   studies remains challenging and is currently limited."

Scientists break through the wall of sleep to the untapped world of dreams

   NSF-supported researchers achieve two-way communication with lucidly
   dreaming people, creating a new method for studying the human mind that
   might lead to innovative ways of learning and problem-solving.
   By Jason Stoughton

   "Eight minus six ... two"

   It's not exactly "one small step for man," but that humble mathematical
   message is extraordinary in its own way. The first part -- "eight minus
   six" -- was transmitted by a scientist to a place just as exotic as the
   moon yet frequented by each of us. The response -- "two" -- came from
   the mind of a sleeping research subject as he snoozed in a neuroscience
   laboratory outside Chicago.

   You see, "eight minus six... two" is a dialogue between two people --
   one of whom was asleep and dreaming.

   "It's authentic communication," says cognitive neuroscientist Ken
   Paller, who oversees the laboratory where this groundbreaking
   communication took place. "It can be done."

   Researchers at Paller's lab at Northwestern University in Illinois,
   along with researchers in France, Germany and the Netherlands, have
   independently demonstrated two-way communication with people as they
   are lucidly dreaming during REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. Supported
   by the U.S. National Science Foundation, the breakthrough was achieved
   in the U.S. by Karen Konkoly, Paller's doctoral student, and
   Christopher Mazurek, a volunteer research participant at the time of
   the study -- and one of the first people to ever engage in a real-time
   dialogue from within a dream.

   This discovery holds tantalizing possibilities for expanding our
   understanding of how our minds work. It may even lead to methods that
   could improve our ability to learn difficult skills or solve complex
   problems.

   And, with the help of a new smartphone app from Paller's lab, you could
   even try it at home.

The windows to the soul (and dreams)

   Research into the fundamental nature of dreams, and what the human mind
   can do while dreaming, has been limited by a seemingly unsolvable
   problem: you can't get much information about someone's dream while
   they're actually having the dream. "All we have are the stories people
   tell when they wake up," says Paller. That deficiency has left an
   entire state of consciousness largely unexplored.

   The novel methods pioneered by Konkoly, Paller and their colleagues are
   designed to solve this problem and open entirely new areas of research
   focused on the dreaming mind. Konkoly describes the possibilities:
   "Right now, we conduct psychology experiments with people who are
   awake. With two-way communication [during dreams], we could conduct
   some of the same experiments while people are sleeping. It could really
   expand our view of consciousness and what the mind is capable of."

   But, how can a dreaming research subject communicate if they can't even
   move, let alone speak, while sleeping? The answer requires some
   explanation about what happens in our mind during sleep.

   and eyes are displayed on a computer monitor.

   Scientists have identified the different stages of sleep by monitoring
   electrical signals from the brain using electroencephalography, or EEG,
   and from other places in the body. When the electrical signals are
   recorded and plotted, they chart the course our mind takes as we
   progress through the stages of sleep.

   As you sleep, your mind transitions through several different stages,
   from light sleep to deep sleep and eventually to REM sleep. REM sleep
   is notable not just for what's moving -- our eyes -- but what isn't.
   Although our mind is active and dreams often occur during REM sleep,
   our bodies are almost completely paralyzed. That presents an obvious
   challenge for communications since we can't move the body parts we
   typically use to communicate. As the name "rapid eye movement"
   suggests, however, there is an exception.

   During REM sleep, our eyes move around behind our eyelids in a
   seemingly random fashion, which often corresponds to the sleeper
   "looking" at various imagined things in their dream. If you dream that
   you're looking at something, your closed eyes move correspondingly as
   if you were looking at something while awake.

   That phenomenon led researchers to a key insight: If eye movement were
   consciously controlled, the dreamer's eyes could become a vehicle for
   getting a message to the waking world.

He's lucid! Let's do math

   Who among us hasn't wished we could fly like a bird? Or walk on another
   planet? So-called lucid dreamers can do these things and more from the
   comfort of their own bed. Accomplished lucid dreamers have reported
   being able to regularly achieve awareness in their dreams and even
   "programming" themselves to have dreams about specific activities or
   locations.

   Christopher Mazurek was not one of those people.

   "I had no experience with lucid dreaming," says Mazurek, an
   undergraduate student at Northwestern University and now research
   assistant in Paller's sleep lab. At the time, he was a volunteer
   research participant. "Before I entered the lab, I never had anything
   near a lucid dream."

   To prepare Mazurek and the other U.S. volunteers, Konkoly wired each
   participant with electrodes that sense brain activity through the
   scalp, behind the ears, on the chin and -- critically -- near the eyes.
   Those would allow the researchers to monitor and record even slight eye
   movements. "When your eyes move in their sockets, it creates an
   electrical current which is detected by the electrodes and recorded,"
   says Konkoly.

   electrodes

   Mazurek in a full EEG rig just before a sleep session in the lab. The
   electrodes on his face will detect the movement of his eyes as he
   sleeps.

   Konkoly also trained each research participant to help them achieve
   lucidity and instructed them on what to do if they succeeded. That
   included learning to recognize the specific sound she would play when
   they entered REM sleep, prompting the participants to realize they're
   dreaming and thus become lucid. The participants also learned the
   distinct response signal they should produce from within their dream:
   moving their eyes from left to right multiple times.

   "Repeatedly looking from left to right is a very distinctive eye
   movement and it stands out from other eye movements during REM sleep,"
   says Konkoly. As she carefully watched the EEG and saw Mazurek
   progressing through the stages of sleep and into REM sleep, she spotted
   the repeating left-right signal on the monitor as Mazurek signaled his
   awareness.

   "He's lucid!" remembers Konkoly. "Let's do math."

   Konkoly played a randomly selected audio recording: "eight minus six."
   Mazurek knew he would be presented with simple math problems but did
   not know which problems would be selected. Some of the international
   labs in the study used different methods to send messages to their
   dreaming subjects, such as flashing lights in Morse code which the
   sleepers could perceive through their closed eyelids and manifest in
   their dream. In most of the labs, the research participants were
   trained to move their "dream eyes" to signal their answer.

   A few seconds later, Konkoly saw Mazurek's response written among the
   peaks and valleys of his eyes' electrical signals: "Two." Konkoly sent
   another randomly selected math problem and once again received a
   correct response. And what was Mazurek dreaming about during this
   groundbreaking exchange between two worlds?

   "I dreamed I was sleeping in the lab when I heard her question," he
   says. Despite that rather mundane dreamscape, "It still blew me away
   how different and intense and odd it all felt. It was different than
   anything I could have imagined."

   Konkoly from his dream. The red shows the distinctive repeating
   left-to-right motion of his eyes as he signals his lucidity twice
   followed by his answer to the math problem: "Two".

   To obtain independent verification of their results, Konkoly sent the
   recorded data to an expert "sleep scorer." Like an astrophysicist who
   can tell you what elements are in a distant star by deciphering the
   colored light recorded in a spectrograph, a sleep scorer is trained to
   "read" the recorded electrical signals and analyze their complex
   patterns. The sleep scorer confirmed that Mazurek was indeed in REM
   sleep during the exchange.

   While Mazurek was the first in Paller's lab to achieve two-way
   communication in a dream, two more participants later accomplished that
   same feat. Meanwhile, researchers in France, Germany and the
   Netherlands were independently testing methods for two-way
   communication in dreams and reported that three additional individuals
   were able to provide correct responses while dreaming. The collective
   results from all the laboratories are now published in the journal
   Current Biology.

Sleep on it

   "Why would you want to do math in your sleep?" quips Konkoly. "I get
   that comment sometimes."

   Joking aside, researchers have a number of ideas for how this discovery
   could be expanded and applied. "There's evidence that lucid dreaming is
   a great place to practice skills compared to when you're awake," says
   Konkoly. "For example, you could slow down time so you could practice a
   skill in more detail or practice something without having any fear of
   the repercussions of failing."

   Imagine a surgeon attempting to perfect a technique used in open heart
   surgery -- in a dream.

   "There are many unexplored neurobiological aspects to learning and
   training during REM sleep. But without two-way communication, you can't
   conduct a proper controlled experiment to understand it," she adds.

   "People say 'sleep on it,' when grappling with a hard problem," says
   Paller, in reference to his research published in 2019, which showed
   people who were cued to think about puzzles during sleep exhibited
   substantial improvement in finding solutions. "There's some sense that
   sleep can help you find an answer to a problem that's vexing you. Our
   two-way communication method provides hope for improving that. If
   you're working on a problem, can you be reminded of that problem during
   a dream and come up with a creative answer more easily?

   "From run of the mill personal problems to complex global problems, we
   need creative solutions. If we can help people come up with the answers
   more easily, we should do that," he says.

   Paller's lab has also developed a smartphone app that aims to make it
   easier for people to achieve lucidity, which could enable anyone to
   phone home from the world of dreams without visiting a sleep
   laboratory. You can learn how to get the app and give it a try through
   Paller's cognitive neuroscience website.

   Researchers are working to expand and refine two-way communications
   with sleeping people so more complex conversations may one day be
   possible.

Our full potential

   Although many aspects of the sleeping mind remain a mystery,
   researchers across a variety of scientific disciplines are utilizing
   new techniques and analytical methods to better understand it. "Sleep
   is valuable for our health in ways we've yet to come to grips with,"
   says Paller. For example, neuroscientists at the University of
   California, Berkeley, recently uncovered evidence showing that sleep
   plays a critical role in how our brains flush out beta-amyloid, a toxic
   substance that contributes to the onset of Alzheimer's disease.

   "REM sleep is a unique state of consciousness," adds Konkoly. "We spend
   a lot of time in it and yet no one really understands its full
   potential. We want to know how it works."

   The pioneering work of Konkoly, Paller and their colleagues provides an
   entirely new method that scientists can use to investigate how sleep
   and dreams affect health and mental abilities.

   And who knows? Perhaps the idea of conversing with someone from within
   a dream may one day be as routine as sending a text message on your
   phone:

   "Can I snooze five more minutes? I've almost figured out this
   problem..."

   Have you ever woken up from a dream about a neighbor or a cousin or the
   barista at your local coffee shop, confused and disoriented and
   wondering what the hell that was all about? Most of us have. Even a
   dream about someone you'd expect to dream about, like an ex or a
   parent, might not make much sense at first.

   If you're finding yourself stumped and can't get it out of your mind, a
   dream-interpretation practice might help. First, it's important to know
   that there are countless traditions, and variations on traditions,
   related to understanding our dreams.

   The Indigenous Guarani culture, for example, has a long history of
   dream-centric spirituality. According to Amanda Takwapu, a spiritual
   practitioner and apprentice to the Tupi-Guarani traditions, specific
   cosmovisions -- ways of approaching and understanding dreamwork --
   might even vary from tribe to tribe. What doesn't change in Guarani
   practice is that it's not viewed as interpretation, exactly. The
   experience of trying to understand a dream is instead seen as a
   conversation between the dream, the person who experienced it, and
   anyone they're talking to about it. "This is something that we dialogue
   with when we're sleeping and when we're awake during the day," she
   explains. "It's a territory that's consciously alive with us."
   For Alex Shiflett, a licensed mental-health clinician and dream doula,
   their practice is influenced by the psychoanalytic methods of Freud and
   Jung as well as various spiritual dream-interpretation methods and the
   use of dreams in creative practices. "My practice is rooted in the
   philosophy that everyone in the dream is you; this is also related to
   the concept of everything and everyone being connected," they explain.

   It's okay if you're unsure which type of dreamwork practice makes the
   most sense for you -- try a few and see what resonates. (Just make sure
   you're being respectful and non-appropriative; in the case of Guarani
   dreamwork, Takwapu says expanding access to traditional knowledge is
   one of her goals, but this may not be true for all Indigenous
   practices.) When a certain method feels right or makes sense to you,
   you'll know. A good first step is to focus on remembering and thinking
   about your dreams, whether that's through a dream journal or good
   old-fashioned conversation. Shiflett recommends using a voice-recording
   app to describe your dream as soon as you wake up -- more on that below
   -- while Takwapu says conversations are best.

   We spoke to Takwapu and Shiflett as well as Autumn Fourkiller,
   Indigenous mystic and writer behind the Dream Interpretation for
   Dummies newsletter, and Lauri Quinn Loewenberg, professional dream
   analyst and author, about how to interpret the people and scenarios we
   envision in our dreams the most. Whether it's an ex, a parent, a
   co-worker, or even a celebrity, keep reading to find out why, for
   better or for worse, we can't seem to get them out of our heads.

.
If you want to start working with your dreams ...

   For Takwapu, remembering and discussing dreams is second nature; it's
   something she has practiced since childhood. "Ever since you're able to
   start talking, you're sharing your dreams with your mother or aunties
   -- usually a matriarch of your village or of your clan," she says. "For
   anybody who didn't have that privilege growing up, of being able to
   share their dreams, articulating is going to be the strongest thing
   that you can do." While Takwapu appreciates dream journals as a way of
   understanding broader trends in your dreaming life and uses one
   herself, she believes that speaking out loud about your dreams, with
   someone else there to hear about them, is the best way to enter into a
   dialogue with them. "When we're dreaming, we're not vocally dialoguing
   with anybody," Takwapu says. "So then the second part is, in the waking
   life, embodying it by feeling it and articulating it. This is going to
   strengthen your ability to bring back that wisdom into this material
   realm."

   Shiflett agrees that any attempt to understand your dream is best done
   in conversation. "Because dreams show us our blind spots, it is best to
   do this practice with someone who works with dreams," they say. "You
   might not `see' something until another person facilitates or reflects
   it back to you." But if you don't have anyone to speak to, another
   option Shiflett recommends is to use a voice recorder as soon as you
   wake up, allowing you to stay close to the dream. They advise telling
   it as you remember it, without overthinking or self-editing, and from
   the first person. It's important to take note of details, from the
   colors you saw to the narrative thread the dream followed. Most
   important, says Shiflett, is to notice what feelings are coming up when
   you think about the dream or particular images in it -- what
   associations are you making, and how does it feel in your body?

   In Guarani tradition, how a dream makes you feel matters more than
   anything else. "For us, it's less about identifying objects, places,
   things in our dreams, but it's very important for us to remember how we
   feel,"  Takwapu says. "That's going to be an indicator either to the
   elders or to our family members of what that dream could signify." But
   what if you can't remember your dreams at all? According to Shiflett,
   there are methods you can try that will help to jog your memory. "If
   you struggle remembering your dreams, tell yourself every night before
   bed that you will remember your dreams," they suggest. "Keep practicing
   writing down even your first thought upon waking. Remembering your
   dreams is like remembering where you put your keys -- not remembering
   something from the past but where you put something."

.
If you want to know why you dreamed about someone specific ...

   "When you dream about someone, you are having subjective and objective
   experiences of this person," says Shiflett. "Sometimes we dream about
   someone but they're nothing like how they are in waking life. So
   there's a part of yourself that you've projected onto an image of this
   person; this person is the chosen image because of personal
   associations with the person." For them, interpreting the dream starts
   with considering your own associations -- memories, feelings, thoughts
   -- with that particular person. From there, you can figure out the
   story that's being told: "Dream interpretation is a practice in tuning
   in with what we know." Since, in Shiflett's practice, everyone in the
   dream is you, you can try putting yourself back in the dream as the
   person you dreamed about. "If you dream of someone, it means you're
   noticing them, or something about them, within yourself." Shiflett also
   says it's important to consider larger patterns and the role the person
   plays in your life and in your dreams more broadly.

   For Takwapu, it's just another example of how important it is to
   connect with how you felt during the dream. "Did you feel safe with
   this person? Did you feel hesitancy around this person in the dream?
   Was this person coming toward you? Were they going away from you?" she
   asks. All of these emotional elements are helpful signals in
   understanding the dream's message.

.
If you're curious about the connections between dreaming and spirituality ...

   For some dream analysts, working with dreams is simply a psychological
   practice based entirely on the dreamer's inner workings and psyche. But
   in many traditions, dreamwork is a spiritual practice. For Shiflett,
   it's a bit of both; they believe that every aspect of a dream comes
   from the self, but they also believe that a person's internal world
   contains a channel to the divine. "We just have to create practices and
   rituals to tune in to the frequency," they say. "Dreams can be part of
   that practice and ritual."

   Takwapu says that for the Guarani, there is no real separation between
   our dreams and the spiritual realm. That can be understood even from
   the Guarani word for dream, Aetxara'u. The prefix, Aetxa, means "to see
   beyond this material realm/plane." Dreams aren't just a channel to the
   spiritual; they themselves take place in a spiritual realm. She uses
   the metaphor that, for her, the spirit realm exists in the same way the
   city of London does: She's not there right now, but she knows it exists
   and is full of movement and life. "The spirits, the energies and the
   entities that some folks outside of an Indigenous culture might see as
   a separate realm -- for us, we view it and we dialogue with it," she
   says. "And we have a relation to it in our waking world and the dream
   space and our afterlife. So it's something that's continually existing,
   and it's not a separate realm."

.
If you're dreaming about someone repeatedly ...

   A one-off dream about another person is one thing. But when it becomes
   a repeated pattern, that can be especially significant. To work with
   repeating dreams about someone specific, Takwapu recommends first
   thinking about how the person you're dreaming about is related to you
   in waking life -- your current interactions with them or even the lack
   thereof. "If they're repeatedly coming to you in dreams, that's
   definitely significant subconsciously or spiritually," she says. Then,
   when discussing how that person is represented in your dreams and in
   your waking life, consider how it feels just to talk about it without
   them present. If you feel the need to include them in the conversation
   or talk to them about what's happening in your dreams, Takwapu says
   that's an indicator of spiritual significance. "There might be a
   dialogue that you guys are meant to have, and maybe this dream is going
   to be opening up that conversation for you," she says. "It's definitely
   something to discuss with a trusted person that guides you in your
   dreams, or also reach out to that person if it's safe to do so."

   Shiflett says that our dreams often involve repeated themes and
   coincidences for us to uncover. "There are synchronicities when
   dreaming of others that we might not know the whole meaning of until
   hindsight," they explain. "Notice how often you might dream of a
   certain person. Does this person in your dream always play the same
   role? Do they come up after certain events in waking life? What is the
   larger pattern?"

.
If you dream about a stranger ...

   Some of the most confusing dreams are the ones in which the subject is
   a person we don't recognize from our waking life. Takwapu cautions
   against automatically thinking of them as a "stranger." "This could be
   a premonition, a spirit, an embodiment that's waiting for you," she
   says. "And we're already identifying it as a stranger. Our words hold
   power; imagine this energy trying to come through to us, and we're
   like, This is a stranger. It's really important -- if you aren't
   familiar with the people that you're dreaming about -- to not
   immediately classify it as a stranger."

   Shiflett says that in their practice, dreams about unfamiliar people
   can be related to the Jungian archetypes found in dreams: the self, the
   shadow, the anima/animus, and the persona. "Explore what this character
   was doing, their role in the dream, and potentially other associations
   with the person," they suggest.

.
If you have a nightmare about someone ...

   So does the tone of the dream matter as much as who was in it? Takwapu
   says it does, but she also explains that in the Guarani cosmovision,
   there's no such thing as a nightmare -- the label itself is a box in
   which we tend to toss any unpleasant feelings that might've come up
   during a dream without closely inspecting them. Instead of doing that,
   she recommends getting curious about the feelings that came up -- did
   you feel unsafe? Did you feel a loss of control? Did you feel shame or
   embarrassment? You can then investigate further into why that feeling
   makes you scared or uncomfortable: "When we start dismantling this idea
   that some dreams are good dreams or nightmares, that's where shadow
   work comes in."

   The feelings a dream brought up can still be spiritually significant.
   Here, Takwapu references the Guarani word Djapytsaká, which she
   describes as a sense of spiritual caution or discernment. Consistently
   practicing that discernment, and deepening your awareness of the dream
   realm, can help you develop a stronger sense of when a dream has a
   message to share. "It could signify that you should reach out to them,
   or maybe it's reminding you to share that dream with them," she says.
   "A lot of the time, we believe when we share our dreams with other
   people, it has more to do with the person we're choosing to share it
   with. There might be a message for them that they need to hear, even if
   we didn't dream about them directly."

.
If you dream about your ex ...

   "The most common ex that we tend to dream about is our first love. In
   fact, we'll dream about that person even 50 years since we've been with
   them," says Loewenberg. The reason why that particular ex tends to keep
   showing up in our dreams is that they symbolize what first love feels
   like -- passion, excitement, always wanting to be together, being
   desired, and all those magical feelings. So the first love will show up
   whenever our current relationship gets a little routine and humdrum and
   we need to spice it up and bring back those feelings. They can also
   show up when we're in a dry spell and we haven't been in a relationship
   for a while."

   According to Fourkiller, ex dreams are all about the past. "Not to get
   too deep in the weeds here, but I'm a young millennial with young
   millennial friends, and that means I have been asked about dreaming
   about an ex too many times to count," says Fourkiller. "My rule of
   thumb is that it almost never means you should get back with said ex,
   especially if it was a horrible terrible relationship that I was always
   very happy to commiserate about the first time around but that, if you
   ignore my dream advice, I will probably not be as happy to again. Ex
   dreams are simply about the past, about what we've left there. About
   the parts (not persons) that may be salvageable from it. About showing
   grace to ourselves." Takwapu says that the relationship you currently
   have with your ex is a relevant factor. "Maybe it's somebody that is no
   contact, but they're still finding you in the dream realm, and that's a
   whole different spiritual conversation to have," she says. "It has to
   do with your protection, your safety, in both the dream realm and the
   waking world." If you can't or don't want to speak to the ex you're
   dreaming about, that in itself can be an indicator of what the dream
   signifies. If you could see yourself talking to your ex about the
   dream, maybe that means there is a conversation you need to have with
   them. But if you can't, it could just mean they're the one trying to
   connect with you. "There could be some things that have been
   unprocessed. There could be emotional things or even spiritual ties
   that are asking to be let go of," she says.

.
If you dream about your mother ...

   "Ah, the mother. Part of the triplicate of the maiden, mother, and
   crone. When it comes to dreams with archetypes, sometimes the most
   obvious answer is the most true," says Fourkiller. "They follow Occam's
   Razor in that respect. So when dreaming of a mother (or your mother) we
   must think about the traditional elements associated with motherhood,
   like nurturing, and ask ourselves if we are neglecting to nurture
   ourselves, a relationship, a dream, etc. If dreaming about your mother
   specifically, that could mean that it is time to interrogate that
   relationship, what it has left you with, and what it is doing to you
   now. Sorry."

   According to Loewenberg, dreams about mothers are more common than
   those about fathers. "We tend to dream about the mother more than the
   father figure. In fact, on average, we tend to dream of our mothers or
   a mother figure about once a week. It's important to remember, though,
   especially when you're figuring out what the different people in your
   dream mean, that all figures actually represent a part of yourself. The
   dreaming mind will show us the different bits of our personality in the
   form of a person. So, that being said, if you're a mother and you dream
   about your mother or a mother figure, that's going to represent your
   role as mom. Pay attention to how she is in the dream. Is she helpful?
   Is she ill? Is she dying? Is she in trouble? However she is portrayed
   in the dream is a reflection of how you are seeing yourself as a mom."

   Loewenberg adds: "If you're not a mother, then go ahead and look at
   your current relationship with your mom. If there's no issue there,
   then she will represent the part of you that is nurturing, takes care
   of yourself, and is nurturing to others around you."

.
If you dream about your co-workers ...

   "If it's a co-worker you deal with on a daily basis -- someone you work
   closely with -- then they probably will be playing themselves," says
   Loewenberg. "And so whatever is going on in the dream will reflect
   whatever is going on between you and the co-worker in real life."

   But how about a co-worker you don't interact with often? Loewenberg
   says the following: "They're going to represent some part of yourself.
   So ask yourself -- and this is a rule that you want to apply with every
   person that shows up in your dream -- what stands out to you about this
   co-worker? What is their outstanding quality? What is the first thing
   you think of when you think about this co-worker? Maybe the co-worker
   you're dreaming about is a tech expert and is really good at fixing
   computers if something goes wrong. Apply that quality to yourself. Do
   you need to take on that quality just for your job or in general? Do
   you feel that you need to be more of a get-it-done-and-fix-it kind of
   person?"

   While Fourkiller agrees that the dream about your co-worker "could
   definitely be a reflection of what is happening" in your real waking
   life, she adds that "work dreams always signify to me a rootedness
   there, in the realm of work. I totally understand this. Capitalism is
   rough. I think these kind of dreams can present a message that, `Hey,
   there is work that needs to be done elsewhere.' Usually you'll be able
   to tell. If the co-worker is berating you, it is time to take a step
   back. If you and the co-worker are in happy collaboration, despite not
   having worked together before, it is probably a good sign and there is
   excavating to be done."

.
If you dream about a significant other ...

   "Pay really close attention to their behavior and their condition in
   the dream," instructs Loewenberg. For example, a really common dream
   we'll have surrounding our significant other is that we can't find them
   ... That can indicate one of two things. It could mean that you miss
   them and that you're not spending enough time with them, because maybe
   they're always working or maybe it's a long-distance relationship. The
   other thing it can mean is that you're looking for a way to better
   connect -- remember that couples can live together yet have no
   connection anymore."

   Fourkiller also urges you to home in on the details of your dream. "It
   depends on the dream, the emotions behind it, but a significant other
   dream can be a happy thing, an `I'm so in love with the person' thing,
   or a message that says you need to pay less attention to this person
   and more attention to what is going on in your own life and heart."

   "It's very important to think about how you felt in the dream, how you
   felt about your interaction with them in the dream, and how you feel in
   your waking life about them," says Takwapu. "When you're able to
   identify how you feel in this dream, it's going to be able to give you
   a way to navigate the relationship."

.
If you dream about your significant other cheating ...

   "First, has there been infidelity in this relationship? If yes, that
   just shows that there's still distrust," says Loewenberg. "But if this
   dream seems to be coming out of left field and you have no reason at
   all to suspect them, the dream doesn't mean that they are cheating. It
   can mean that you feel that there is a third wheel in the relationship,
   like work or golf or a new baby -- something that is causing you to
   feel cheated out of your time and attention with the significant
   other."

   Fourkiller also points to previous cheating as an important factor.
   "Don't jump to conclusions! Just like a death dream, this doesn't mean
   that they are cheating. Unless they have before. Then they might be,"
   she says. "If they haven't, though, think about the material reality of
   the relationship. Have you been spending enough time together? What is
   lacking here? Am I being supported? Am I supporting? All that."

.
If you dream about your significant other dying ...

   "Don't look at that literally! Dreams are symbolic," Loewenberg
   reassures. If you look at it literally, you're going to freak yourself
   out. In a dream, death represents something ending or changing. So, is
   there some kind of big change going on in your relationship? Are you
   reaching a new level? Did you suddenly get engaged? Or is your
   significant other changing in some way? Have they lost a lot of weight?
   Did they get a promotion, and now there's not enough time with each
   other and that relationship is changing in that respect? Assess things
   with that kind of approach." Fourkiller agrees that a shift is on the
   horizon. "This relationship is about to evolve, big time. It does not
   mean that they are about to keel over."

.
If you dream about someone who has already died ...

   For this one, Fourkiller says the interpretation depends on your
   personal beliefs. "I am someone who believes the dead can visit us,
   that they can give us messages or just drop by. If you're not, though,
   think about what messages (though perhaps not literal) your brain is
   trying to bring you by presenting this person to you. Is it a message
   of grief? Of love? Of warning?"

   "If you dream of someone who has died, they will likely represent a
   personality trait that you both share," Loewenberg adds. "Or they can
   represent who you were when they were alive and in your life. For
   example, if you have a childhood friend who has passed away and you
   dream of them, they could represent who you were back when you were
   friends and they were alive."

.
If you dream about someone famous ...

   "Celebrities are really fun to dream about! One of the most common
   dreams of a celebrity is that you're friends with them and you're
   hanging out with them," says Loewenberg. "It can be a celebrity you
   really like or it can be someone who seems random ... Regardless, the
   celebrity is going to represent some part of yourself that, like a
   celebrity, you feel deserves recognition and perhaps even applause. Ask
   yourself what the celebrity is best known for. Is it a song? Look at
   the title or the lyrics of that song because chances are there will be
   something relevant to your life in either the title or lyrics. If the
   celebrity is an actor, are they best known for a TV show or a movie?
   Then ask yourself if something is relevant to you in the title of that
   show or movie, in the story line, or, perhaps, in the character they
   play -- maybe you relate to that."

   Unless you recently watched something with that particular celebrity,
   Fourkiller says this dream may actually be about your own desire for
   recognition. "Did you watch a movie with them in it? If not, let's talk
   about recognition and celebration. There is a part of you that deserves
   to be recognized and celebrated, and it's probably not being recognized
   or celebrated," she says. "Can you identify that part? Can you see it?"

.
On the celebs who appear in dreams most often:

   "I remember there was a time when Oprah was the most dreamt of
   celebrity ... but I would say that, overall, in all the years I've been
   doing this, it would probably be the president at the time that I get
   asked about the most," says Loewenberg. For Fourkiller? "Not gonna lie,
   it's Nic Cage. Maybe I'm just friends with a bunch of Nic Cage
   superfans, but he comes up more often than you think. My subscribers
   and clients are much less likely to submit a dream for interpretation
   that has to do with celebrities, though perhaps that's because they
   think it is less worthy of interpretation."

   The takeaway: Fourkiller notes that even the silly dream you deem
   unworthy of interpretation still has significance. "Not every dream
   necessarily has a meaning, but all dreams are important. Even if
   they're silly. Even if they're scary. And so on," she says. "Knowing
   whether a dream is worth interpreting is up to the dreamer themself,
   and it is something that only comes with time. I cannot decide for you
   what is important, I can only guide you into (hopefully) a deeper
   self-knowledge, one that you will use to add weight and importance to
   your own experience, which will in turn let you value your mind, your
   thoughts, and yes, always, your dreams."

   In general, Fourkiller says dream interpretation can be an incredibly
   subjective practice. "My interpretations are rooted in both a personal
   spiritual practice, and, if we're getting technical, probably a
   Jungian-inspired one, too. So with that in mind, your interpretation
   might be different than one I might come up with, but that doesn't make
   it less true," she says. "My rule of thumb here is to not disregard
   obvious conclusions, but to never settle on a final interpretation
   until everything has been sorted through. Make sure to pay attention to
   themes, emotions, archetypes, etc. This will help you dig deeper,
   reflect, and not lean on surface-level analysis."

   I don't believe that dreams have any special meaning, or anything.
   Nevertheless, I find dreams interesting. I always try to remember what
   I dreamt about right after I wake up, and I even remember many dreams I
   had when I was still a child.

   So, I've noticed that my dreams kinda have a recurrent theme. Even
   though they are quite messy and they never seem to really have a plot,
   I almost always seem to be anxious about something in them. I'm either
   late for class, or I forgot to feed my cat, or I can't find something I
   really need... There's always something wrong or amiss, and it's
   usually my fault. lol. Last night I dreamt that there were many kitties
   running around inside a house (or some place... I'm not sure if it was
   a house), and I had to pick them up and place them somewhere, but
   whenever I tried to hold one, it would scape and run away. My dream
   self doesn't show any emotions, but I know the whole situation was
   making me feel distressed. Gosh, I have such random dreams. -_-

   Anyway, I really like to hear about people's dreams. So, do you have a
   recurrent dream? What are your dreams like? :)

   Sometimes, I have this dream where there's this giant black ball in
   front of me and I just go to pick off the tiniest piece I can; and for
   some reason, it makes me feel sick once I'm conscious.

   Other than that, I can't really remember any dreams I have. However, I
   can sometimes remember my daydreams and fantasies I have whilst I'm
   awake [usually at the expense of my school work! XD]

   my recurring dreams are usually negative because we have something that
   worries us and we became fixated and consumed by what where afraid of.
   for example i had a recurring dream that someone was chaseing me with a
   neddle because im terrified by needles and had to do blood work that
   following week.

   I often dream about going back to high school or college and doing
   homework I hate, taking boring classes, or taking difficult exams. I
   always feel relieved when I wake up and realize it's just a dream.

   I also tend to dream about important things that are going to happen
   soon, e.g. an exam I'll take tomorrow, an upcoming trip, or a show I'm
   going to see.

   Most of my dreams take place in an academic setting; it gets pretty
   interesting when primary schools and uni are magically combined to form
   one infinitely complex building. I always seem to be running around and
   late for something, though I never quite know what.

   I also often dream about things I've seen/experienced lately. About a
   month ago, my unconscious mind tried to merge The Voice and Mean Girls,
   so I was walking across campus with Janis, Damian, and Adam Levine. The
   really weird part was I was Lindsay Lohan. o_o

   Often it's tornadoes and rain storms.

   Although a couple of nights ago, I dreamed I was at a party that was so
   wild, 3 of the guests were wearing zentais! :blink:

   One interesting characteristic of my dreams is that I'm always aware of
   the geographic direction, even though it's just a dream... anyone else
   experience this?

   Most of my dreams relate to things going on in my life, emotions I'm
   feeling, things I really want to have or to be true or think about
   frequently... sometimes fears and anxieties... usually nothing too
   spectacular. Sometimes the scenarios can be a little far-fetched,
   though usually still based in reality somehow.

   There have been several recurring dreams I've had in my lifetime. As a
   kid, I used to dream about being alone in my parents' car, behind the
   steering wheel, with the car rolling down the hill on the road we lived
   on, headed straight for our mailbox. I always knew I was going to
   crash, but there was nothing I could do to stop the car, no one who
   could help... so I just sat there, terrified. The dream never actually
   got to the point of the car crashing, though; I always woke up while it
   was coasting down the hill. If I recall correctly, I think sometimes
   (though not always) my dad would be standing at the end of our
   driveway, just watching, helpless to do anything. Mostly I had this
   dream between the ages of about four and eight or so.

   The second recurring dream is one that started in my mid-teens and
   which I still have in various forms today (though nowhere near as
   frequently as I used to have it). At 14-15 I developed an eating
   disorder (still with me today at nearly 28), and during the worst years
   of restricting and being extremely underweight, I used to dream at
   least several times a week about completely losing control with food.
   I'd somehow have forgotten in the dream that I had an eating disorder
   and I'd eat normally like I used to (or I'd overeat), and then I'd
   suddenly remember, "Oh shit! I'm not allowed to do this anymore!" Lame
   as it sounds, those were terrifying dreams. I'd get hysterical in them,
   crying and screaming and panicking over what I'd done, how I'd ruined
   everything, how I'd done the worst possible thing in the world that I
   could think of -- something I no longer permitted myself to do in real
   life. Many times I'd wake up in a panic, and even though I'd soon
   realise it had just been a dream, I'd have to check my body, running my
   hands over the familiar bones I could feel, lying on my side with my
   knees together and making sure my thighs didn't touch when I was in
   that position, recalling the last thing I'd had to eat and recounting
   every detail of it in my mind to make absolutely sure I hadn't actually
   eaten something I wasn't "allowed" to. I still sometimes have these
   dreams now, though usually they focus on outright bingeing on massive
   amounts of food (not just eating normally) and then forgetting that I
   was "supposed" to throw it all up... lame, I know. :mellow:

   Nah, it's not lame at all... It actually sounds really anguishing. I
   also think dreams tend to represent things we worry too much about...
   No wonder your eating disorder would be represented in your dreams.

   I think my dreams may represent my OCPD, somehow. Like, because of the
   way I always seem to be anxious about something that went slightly
   wrong in them. In real life, I'm always worried about miserable details
   and obsessed with control, and in my dreams it seems I lose all
   control.

   I wish I could dream of more relaxing stuff, like flying, maybe. I've
   never had a dream where I was flying. lol

   I often dream about going back to high school or college and doing
   homework I hate, taking boring classes, or taking difficult exams. I
   always feel relieved when I wake up and realize it's just a dream.

   I have dreams like those as well. Inside the dream I usually think "oh,
   fuck, why the hell am here? Noooooo, it can't be". :P

   One interesting characteristic of my dreams is that I'm always aware of
   the geographic direction, even though it's just a dream... anyone else
   experience this?

   That's very curious. I think I've never experienced that.

   I try not to dream, my subconscious scares me. tl;dr: murder.

   Now I'm kinda curious. :huh: You murdering someone, someone murdering
   you, or someone murdering someone else? (If you don't mind my asking)

   Me murdering someone else, a stranger. In one case, multiple people.
   After that happens, I feel remorseful in my dream state... It's an
   interesting thing. Usually it's innocent people who I don't know,
   unarmed people. My sleep schedule keeps me quite safe from these
   terrors, however. I go to bed around 3-4am, and wake up whenever. I
   tend to dream when I go to bed at 10pm or earlier. If it's not some
   horrifying event, it's being powerless, which is also horrible. With
   the first example, I was unable to stop what was happening. If I were
   in my right mind, I hope I'll never encounter a situation like that,
   and if I do, I hope I'll not do anything reckless. (I shouldn't, seeing
   as I don't have access to any firearms.)

   Aside from general weirdness, there's an unfortunate streak of
   violence, aggression/threats, and being followed/persecuted/harrassed
   in my dreams. (Thankfully not in all of them, but way, way too common
   for my liking.)

   I often dream about going back to high school or college and doing
   homework I hate, taking boring classes, or taking difficult exams. I
   always feel relieved when I wake up and realize it's just a dream.

   Being back in school is very common for me, too. Over the last two
   years or so, it has shifted noticably, though - before that, it seemed
   just "normal" that I'd be stuck in some kind of infinity loop that
   repeats the last 2-3 school years forever; nowadays, I'm nearly always
   aware that I did graduate 20 years ago already, and just show up
   randomly at school whenever I want (missing 90% of class and 99% of
   homework, to boot... and very aware of having no chance in hell to
   graduate again, but also that I don't need to, as I already did. :)).
   My dream!classmates still are just as I knew them, though - they seem
   forever stuck in their late teens and apparently going through 12th
   grade for the whatever-th time without noticing.

   I never dream about real places. My dreams otherwise follow the laws of
   physics, even though the plot may skip and jump. Very cunning my
   dreams, it's hard for me to consistently pick holes in the reality of
   them (Tried to learn to lucid dream not long ago). The actual plot can
   vary, though if they're indicating something going on in my
   subconscious I usually know as soon as I wake up that they were
   significant. Significant people - you know who you are - often pop up
   in them, often in strange roles (Don't ask!)

   Most of my dreams vary wildly. But I do have a lot of dreams about
   Sherlock and Merlin. Occasionally I'll have dreams that I'll 'wake up'
   in and do stuff before falling asleep or being knocked out in the dream
   and then waking up. It makes things really confusing sometimes. :/

   Me and my mum both have a 'dream reality' where everything will seem
   the same in our dreams but with subtle differences that we don't notice
   until we wake up. Like a whole world in our heads. For example, one
   time my mum dreamt she was in London, but in her dream reality London
   was slightly different. It was a little more maze-like. Streets led to
   different places than usual and sometimes you would find yourself in a
   part of London that doesn't actually exist in reality at all but you
   feel that it does.

   Sometimes, when I realise I am dreaming everything will suddenly fall
   apart like it was an act the whole time. The people around me will
   suddenly get really angry with me for realising that I am dreaming and
   then I wake up feeling a little like I was just about to be attacked by
   those dream people. O_o Scary stuff.

   I also get a lot where people push me off of high places (¬_¬...) and I
   wake up feeling like I am falling...>.<

   I rarely dream at all

   But when I do, it's often boring and mundane or strange.

   Mine don't have many recurring themes, but the themes are often from
   memories. One about recurring burglary, as I was a victim of it. One
   about experiencing parts of me falling off and rare dreams which I am
   greeted with the characters I use to sooth being overwhelmed and um...
   A number of sexual... Self-pleasure dreams :huh:

   The only recurring theme they have that I can think of is that they're
   all extremely strange and unpredictable. They're like acid trips, minus
   the acid. People often say that I should write books or make movies
   based off the events in my dreams.

   My former classmates appear in my school dream too, but sometimes I

   Sometimes classmates from different stages mix together in my dream,
   like college classmates and junior high classmates sitting in the same
   classroom.

   Usually something I'm anxious about--a test, a project, an upcoming
   meeting.

   I have a lot of such dreams too, almost guaranteed to happen before a
   big event...

   I've never watched 'Inception'. I don't even really know what its
   about.

   Basically, it's about lucid dreaming in someone else's dream, used for
   thought crime... it's a lot like a classic bank heist movie, only in
   the inside of someone's mind. (And with another dream-related subplot I
   sure won't spoiler you on.... ;)) I definitely recommend giving the
   movie a try if you haven't seen it yet!

   I barely ever dream, and when I do it normally means I'm due a bout of
   insomnia, so it's not exactly a happy occasion. My dreams are weird
   anyway - they make literally no sense. Three nights on the bounce I
   dreamed I was a boy called Jason who had been accused of murder, and
   despite being guilty, was innocent. Nope, I don't follow either. I
   don't have nightmares particularly though, so I guess it's good that
   they're just plain strange.

   My dreams are usually all over the place. The best ones are
   action/adventure themed and the worst ones are work anxiety. Either
   way, I know I dream in color. I just wish I had the artistic ability to
   take some of the vistas I've dreamt of to get them out of my head.

   Funny aside, so I went on Zyrtec a couple of years ago when my
   allergies reached a peak in the spring. The first couple of nights on
   that stuff was wild. I never remembered what I dreamt but I just know
   it was vivid. I woke up feeling pretty good the next morning although
   it could have been the result of actually being able to breathe while
   sleeping. Oxygen to the brain is a good thing!

   All of my dreams are extremely vivid, which would be fine if it wasn't
   for the nightmares. A blanket word I've started using to describe them
   has been "Lovecraftian." Even the more low-key ones have involved
   giant, mutated, wildly colored spiders that are usually everywhere, and
   the dreams I have about tornadoes are strange in the fact that in every
   dream I have about them the horizon always seems to bend away from me.
   These dreams always have a tendency to create a bout of insomnia,
   because I chain dream nightmares, which is not fun. It's actually been
   getting to the point I've been seriously thinking about writing down
   the bulk of what I can remember and turning them into stories.
   Then there are the generally weird dreams, like this one dream I had
   where I was shaving Val Kilmer's face with a Christmas card. But one
   type of dream that I seem to have semi-annually these days (outside of
   the nightmares) are dreams where for some reason I'm chain smoking.
   Sometimes I'm drinking instead, but usually I'm smoking. Which is
   weird, because I do neither, and I find these dreams to be generally
   upsetting.

   One awesome dream I had though, I was apparently a planetary terrain
   mapper who worked from space using a jet pack to get around and
   everyone was wearing Indiana Jones style fedoras. I managed to gain
   lucidity before waking up, too, which was pretty awesome.

   I used to frequently dream about another planet crashing into the
   earth. It would usually start with me just looking at a sunset or a
   comet or something which would be extremely beautiful and then the
   dream would take a dark turn and this massive round object would appear
   to approach the earth and i would wake up when it's about to hit. it
   was kinda beautiful though because the massive object would always seem
   to be approaching calmly and more like it was merging into the earth
   rather than colliding violently.
   Anyway it's weird to explain to people why jupiter scares me.
   Also i remember reading Coleridge's Kubla Khan for the first time and
   that night i dreamt i was in a deep green grassland that stretched as
   far as i could see and above me the sky was a dark blue melting into
   reds, oranges and yellows at the horizon (i guess my subconscious isn't
   very creative ^_^ ) Infact now that I recall fantastically green,
   tranquil and mystified worlds are a regular theme for my dreams. I have
   dreamt multiple times that i am visiting this place which is basically
   a marble runway with huge marble pillars in middle of a thick forest.
   another time before going to this place i stopped at the entrance to
   have a quick swim in the pond/pool. the water was black and there was
   no one there. I would rather not wake up from these dreams..
   and flying! i've flown a lot in many dreams and it's awesome!

   For 14 years I had a recurring dream. I had it at least once a week
   sometimes up to three, and it involved me going back to work at the pet
   shop I was made redundant from. I loved the job and the people and it
   hurt me massively to be let go. I have never had an anxiety dream that
   would fit the normal bill. No naked classes, no missed bus, late
   homework, but this dream was often about the pain I suffered at being
   axed and at times, me venting.

   When I was very ill this dream and some very disturbing dreams would
   make up most of my dreams. I'm not one for believing the schtick that

   For 14 years I had a recurring dream. I had it at least once a week
   sometimes up to three, and it involved me going back to work at the pet
   shop I was made redundant from. I loved the job and the people and it
   hurt me massively to be let go. I have never had an anxiety dream that
   would fit the normal bill. No naked classes, no missed bus, late
   homework, but this dream was often about the pain I suffered at being
   axed and at times, me venting.

   When I was very ill this dream and some very disturbing dreams would
   make up most of my dreams. I'm not one for believing the schtick that
   goes with dreams and their meanings and I often baffled my
   Psychologist. I dreamed to have happier dreams. Since coming off of all
   the poison I was forced to take and partially recovering my health, I
   have found myself having multiple jolly nice dreams. Happy, peacefull,
   fun dreams, no waking up screaming the place down dreams. No night
   terrors and when I awake, I feel like I have actually slept. It's bliss
   <_< :)

   Some antidepressants can cause really horrifying dreams (I don't know
   if that's what you were on, but anyway...).

   Oooh yes. I wouldn't want to go off my meds (SSRI antidep), as my
   waking hours are tons better ever since... but I've woken up screaming
   a handful of times since I take them, which I can't remember ever
   having occured before.

Jurassic Park fan fulfils childhood dream of recreating Jeep

In short:

   Adelaide man Zakary Weyer has turned a childhood dream into a reality
   by building his very own Jurassic Park Jeep.

   He joins a global community dedicated to recreating the vehicles that
   appeared in the 1993 blockbuster film.

   Mr Weyer says he frequently receives photo requests from strangers when
   he drives his replica.

   Zakary Weyer's obsession with Jurassic Park began before he was even
   born.

   "My parents actually went and saw it in the cinema when my mum was
   still pregnant with me. So I think that's probably where it started,"
   he said.

   When he grew up, he turned his childhood dream into a reality and built
   his very own Jurassic Park Jeep.

     "It's always been a dream of mine, since I was a kid, to have one of
     these,"

   he said.

   It took a while to find the right car, and while it is not perfectly
   accurate to the movie, he was still able to make it look as detailed as
   possible.

   "I've done a few different professions in my time and sort of picked up
   a lot of different skills that I needed," he said.

   "So welding and the metal bending and electrical work for the lighting
   and all that kind of stuff. [I] just picked it up over the years.

   "There's always some little thing you want to change or make better."

A T-rex sized hit

   Jurassic Park premiered in 1993 and quickly became the highest-grossing
   movie of all time, dethroned five years later by Titanic.

   For a generation of dinosaur-mad children it remains a cornerstone of
   pop culture, with six sequels and numerous books, TV shows and video
   games released in the three decades since.

   The dinosaurs are the stars of Jurassic Park, but vehicles play a major
   role in many of the film's iconic moments.

   There's the scene where Dr Alan Grant -- played by Sam Neill -- and Dr
   Ellie Sattler -- played by Laura Dern -- watch in awe from a Jeep as a
   Brachiosaurus walks past, or when a Tyrannosaurus rex breaks free and
   attacks the park's tour cars.

   Mr Weyer no longer uses his Jeep for the daily commute, but whenever he
   takes to Adelaide's roads he can expect the same reaction.

   "Every time I park somewhere basically I get people coming up asking
   for photos," he said.

   "One guy nearly actually crashed his bike getting a gander [as] he was
   going past."

Fandom finds a way

   There is a global community dedicated to recreating the cars from
   Jurassic Park.

   Byron Phillips is from the Australian branch of the Jurassic Park Motor
   Pool.

   Sanders)

   "We drive all around Australia ... doing events and charity work as
   well," he said.

   "It's all about making people smile at the end of the day. And creating
   those memories for people when they see the vehicle and they have a
   photo or they see it drive past.

   "For those few moments, you're really tapping into the fandom of
   whatever that car is, and whatever it belongs to."

   He loves the thrill of being spotted on the roads, but there is a
   deeper meaning behind the Jurassic Park tribute.

   "My son has a disability so a big part of the reason that I went with
   the Jurassic Jeep is because he can say 'Jeep' and 'dinosaur'," he
   said.

   "And so whenever I drive around town, he knows where I am. So it takes
   away the anxiety of 'where's Dad?'"

   Unlike Mr Weyer, Mr Phillips had zero mechanical knowledge when he
   first started putting his car together around a decade ago, so he was
   reliant on other members of the Motor Pool offering their advice.

   "There's an online resource and a group where they can compare notes
   and give guidance on certain parts of the Jeeps," he said.

   "It's always there. And people learn from each other. They learn from
   their mistakes. There's been many mistakes made."

From the road to the big screen

   Several cars from the Jurassic Park Motor Pool made it to the big
   screen in 2024, when amateur filmmakers in regional Victoria released a
   shot-for-shot low budget remake of the original film.

   John Roebuck, who directed Jurassic Park: Castlemaine Redux, said the
   production value from having Hollywood-accurate vehicles was immense.

   "It definitely felt like it was a level up in terms of production
   value," he said.

   "I think the cast and crew were used to me turning up to set with
   spray-painted Super Soakers or these very flimsily-made velociraptor
   pens that I'd spent weeks building that fell apart as soon as we
   finished shooting.

     "The day the cars turned up there really was an air of excitement.
     It felt like a level up."

   He even got to outrun a T-rex in one of the vehicles, in his on-screen
   role as game hunter Robert Muldoon.

   "We had the actors dressed up as Ellie Sattler and Ian Malcolm in the
   back of the Jeep and it felt a little bit like Jurassic Park virtual
   reality. It was a bizarre but exciting feeling," he said.

'Not as hard as you think'

   Zakary Weyer said building the Jeep had been a "life changer".

   It was also a lot cheaper than he expected, costing around $10,000 for
   the Jeep, and a further $2,000 on the Jurassic Park fit-out.

   Whether it's a Jurassic Park Jeep, a Back To The Future DeLorean, or a
   Batmobile, he has a simple message to anyone wanting to recreate their
   favourite movie vehicle.

   "Just do it. It's actually not as hard as you think once you get
   started," he said.

   "It's always just taking that first small step like getting a set of
   wheels, painting them. That's a pretty simple one.

     "And then from there, you'll realise, it's actually not that bad.
     It's bit by bit."

   Key Takeaways:
     * Potomac native Chris Williams launched to the International Space
       Station last month for an eight-month mission.
     * The MIT astrophysics researcher is conducting stem cell and
       artificial intelligence research aboard the ISS.
     * Williams credits Montgomery County Public Schools and Blair High
       School for nurturing his passion for science.
     * The astronaut says viewing Earth from space underscores its
       fragility and global interconnectedness.

   While most Americans spent Thanksgiving Day gathered around a table
   with family and friends, feet firmly planted on the ground, one
   Maryland-raised man spent the day journeying to the stars.

   Chris Williams, who grew up in Potomac, has been an astrophysics
   researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a clinical
   physicist at Harvard Medical School. He has helped build a
   low-frequency radio telescope array in Western Australia, studied
   supernovas at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory in D.C. and
   volunteered as an emergency medical technician and firefighter.

   But Williams always dreamed of going to space, floating weightless and
   seeing the Earth as a tiny blue ball.

   Last month, the 42-year-old father of two took off from Kazakhstan in a
   spacecraft headed for the International Space Station. He'll be in
   space for about eight months. The crew is doing stem cell research and
   working with artificial intelligence, among other things.

   After settling in at the ISS, Williams talked with The Washington Post
   this month about how the start of his time in space is going and how it
   feels to shoot for the stars and finally reach them.

   This interview has been edited and condensed.

   Q: What made you want to become an astronaut?

   A: I mean, I actually don't know. When I was a little kid, I was always
   fascinated by exploration and in particular, space. I think it's one of
   those things that a lot of kids have fascinations with. So it was
   something I dreamed about as a kid and never let go.

   Q: Your parents told me "Star Trek" was a big inspiration for you.

   A: Absolutely. Growing up, we didn't watch a lot of TV, but that was
   one of the shows that we watched sort of together as a family. I think
   that the ethos they express on "Star Trek," of wanting to explore for
   the benefit of all, that's certainly something that's really imprinted
   on me and something I firmly believe in.

   Q: How does it feel physically to be up there? I know you trained for
   it, but I'm sure that it's different.

   A: It's definitely different. Being weightless and in microgravity,
   it's a super interesting experience. I think it took me a couple days
   for my brain to kind of get used to it. You work in three dimensions.
   So we have lockers and drawers and experiments that are on the walls,
   but are also on the ceilings and on the floor. ...

   It's been an interesting experience seeing how your brain adapts to
   being in this weightless environment. And it is a lot of fun to fly
   around and let go of things and have them float.

   Q: Will you get to do a spacewalk?

   A: We have some spacewalks on the schedule coming up in January, and
   I'm hoping that I'll be able to go out and be a part of that. I think
   that'll be a really great experience.

   Q: Is there a tiny part of you that's a little scared to walk in space?

   A: When it's something you train so much for, you understand the risks,
   but you also understand all the things we're doing to mitigate those
   risks. When you have a deep understanding of what's all going into it,
   at least for me, that helps take a lot of those fearful emotions out of
   it.

   Q: I wanted to ask how your experience with the Montgomery County
   schools fostered your interest in space?

   A: I do not think I would be where I am today without the upbringing I
   had in Montgomery County, in particular, the fabulous public school
   system. I felt like growing up I had so many opportunities to pursue my
   interest in science. I went to Blair High School, which just had
   fantastic opportunities to really push my passion for science and to
   give me the opportunities to really explore what it would look like to
   be a scientist.

   I was also able to take advantage of the fact that there are a ton of
   wonderful opportunities with federal research labs. As a high-schooler,
   I was able to do astronomy research at the Navy Research Lab in D.C.

   One other thing that I think is pretty special about Montgomery County
   is its diversity, the fact that you're surrounded by people who come
   from all over. In the International Space Station, we're a
   collaboration of 15 different countries. And my work every day involves
   interfacing with people from all across the world. Growing up in
   Montgomery County, you get really comfortable with that, which is
   really, really wonderful.

   Q: What are you doing in your downtime up there? Do you have downtime?

   A: We're pretty busy up here, but we do have a little bit of downtime.
   Most of the time, I try to call my friends and family. One of the
   challenges is that even though we are only 240 miles above the surface
   of the Earth, we're still pretty far away. And I'm going to be up here
   for an eight-month mission. So staying connected with my friends and
   family back home, and my daughters is really important to me.

   The other thing that's really nice to do is to ... look out the window.
   Pretty incredible views from out here.

   Q: What does it look like?

   A: That's one of the things that just doesn't disappoint. You see these
   fabulous pictures of what the Earth looks like from space, and that's
   what your view out the window looks like every day. You can see huge
   swaths of the world moving by, the view of city lights at night or just
   the wonderful natural beauty of Earth.

   Q: What does that do to your perspective?

   A: I think the biggest emotion for me when I look out the window is
   this sense of how everybody that I care about and know and love is on
   this thing that I can see the whole extent of and ... just how small
   and fragile Earth looks. That really leaves an impression on you.

   With an ambition to redefine luxury travel in the Middle East, Saudi
   Arabia is preparing to launch Dream of the Desert, a rail experience
   scheduled to debut in 2026.

   Initially announced in 2024, the project brings together Saudi Arabia
   Railways, the Ministry of Culture, and the Saudi Tourism Authority,
   along with the Italian company Arsenale, known for the La Dolce Vita
   Orient Express, to advance the Kingdom's long-distance travel through
   lavish, premium, and culturally driven experiences.

   With this in mind, Arsenale is also behind several high-profile
   hospitality projects, including Soho House Roma, Hotel Santavenere in
   Maratea, and a growing collection of Orient Express hotels such as
   Orient Express La Minerva in Rome, Orient Express Palazzo Dona
   Giovannelli in Venice, and the Abbazia di Spineto in Tuscany.

   According to various sources, one of the project's key aims is to
   strengthen Saudi Arabia's position in luxury transport, placing it in
   competition with some of the world's most celebrated luxury trains.
   These include the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express, the Royal Scotsman,
   and the British Pullman.

   Additionally, the initiative will play a key role in promoting
   sustainable economic growth. At the heart of this strategy is
   attracting sustainable foreign investment and promoting tourism as a
   sector capable of generating long-term returns, independent of oil.

   By attracting international visitors from higher-spending markets and
   increasing levels of luxury tourism expenditure, the initiative is
   expected to raise national income and create multi-sector economic
   opportunities. This assessment is supported by a report from GCC
   Railway, a website specialising in transport and economic development.

Ultra-luxury design onboard

   In terms of design, Dream of the Desert will feature 31 stylish suites,
   including two presidential suites, for up to 66 guests, with two
   restaurants serving Saudi and international cuisine with an Italian
   touch, and cocktails in the Majlis lounge.

   Furthermore, the 14-car train features vintage Italian carriages
   redesigned for modern luxury, offering an ultra-luxury experience
   comparable to Japan's Seven Stars of Kyushu and Malaysia's Eastern &
   Oriental Express.

   Turning to the routes, operators confirmed earlier this month that
   pre-reservations are open for five itineraries, each showcasing a
   different aspect of Saudi Arabia's cultural and natural heritage.

   One of the flagship routes, The Northern Sands, is a three-day journey
   from Riyadh to Al Jouf. The itinerary includes visits to Marid Castle,
   the ancient rock carvings of Jubbah, and an overnight desert
   experience.

   Another itinerary, A Taste of AlUla, runs from Riyadh to AlUla, with
   stops in Al Jouf and Jubbah along the way. The journey features bespoke
   programming developed in collaboration with AlUla Destination.

   Shorter options are also available for travellers seeking a more
   compact experience. Whispers of Jubbah is a two-day itinerary focused
   on the prehistoric carvings of Jubbah and a visit to Diriyah. Ramadan
   Nights is a seasonal journey, with iftar and suhoor served onboard in
   the desert, followed by stargazing.

   Meanwhile, Summer Mirage offers a two-day return journey from Riyadh,
   featuring themed events and dining tailored for summer travel.

Aligning with Vision 2030 goals

   As energy economist Nihad Ismail puts it, the project is one of the
   strategic pillars of Saudi Vision 2030, an ambitious tourism and
   transport initiative aimed at diversifying the economy and reducing
   dependence on fossil fuels.

   Nihad also noted that the train is the first of its kind in the Middle
   East in terms of luxury and high-end design, drawing comparisons with
   Europe's famous Orient Express.

   Nihad added that the project's significance lies in its close alignment
   with the core objectives of Vision 2030, particularly those focused on
   attracting 150 million visitors to the Kingdom by the end of the decade
   and positioning Saudi Arabia as a global destination for tourism and
   investment.

   Expanding on this point, Nihad explained that Dream of the Desert is
   not just a mode of transport but a fully integrated tourism experience,
   with its first journeys expected to begin in the final quarter of 2026,
   departing from Riyadh and travelling toward Jordan's southern border.
   Covering approximately 1,300 kilometres, the route passes through areas
   of tourism, historical, and cultural significance.

   According to Nihad, this corridor presents a valuable opportunity to
   promote domestic destinations and connect them through a luxury
   transport network, further enhancing the Kingdom's appeal as a regional
   and global tourism destination.

A strategic tourism vision

   Weighing in on the project's significance, Ali Metwally, an economist
   at a London-based consultancy, told The New Arab that Dream of the
   Desert represents both a symbolic and strategic step. He said it should
   not be viewed as a form of mass transportation, but rather as a
   high-end tourism and entertainment product.

   Because of its luxurious positioning and limited capacity, Ali further
   explained that the project's direct impact on mass transport providers
   is likely to be limited. Instead, it is expected to target
   high-spending visitors who typically rely on domestic aviation or
   private transport rather than traditional land-based services.

   However, he believes the project could help reposition the land
   transport sector over the medium term. Ali said some operators may
   adapt by acting as feeder services to railway stations or by focusing
   on more economical travel segments, while luxury rail offerings cater
   to the high-end tourism market.

   From an economic perspective, Ali argued that the project's impact
   extends beyond simply replacing one mode of transport with another. He
   identified three key areas where its influence could be felt.

   The first relates to maximising the economic value of each tourist.
   Rather than being confined to one or two cities, travellers will move
   along a long geographic corridor that includes natural, historical, and
   heritage sites.

   According to Ali, this is likely to extend visitor stays and increase
   spending on accommodation, local activities and services along the
   route, contributing positively to non-oil tourism income.

   The second area concerns the project's role in shaping a new image of
   Saudi Arabia as a diverse, high-end tourism destination.

   Ali said this positioning moves beyond Umrah, Hajj and urban tourism to
   include distinctive experiences such as luxury train journeys through
   the desert, strengthening the Kingdom's tourism brand and appealing to
   visitors with high purchasing power.

   The third area concerns the broader transformation of the transport
   sector, with Ali noting that Dream of the Desert is part of a national
   strategy to expand the railway network and improve the overall quality
   of life.

'Lifting the heavyweight belt will fulfil a dream'

   Frazer Clarke said he grew up loving the sport and watching the greats

   Lifting the British heavyweight title would be the fullfilment of a
   dream for boxing champion Frazer Clarke.

   The Staffordshire fighter, an Olympic bronze medallist, has been in the
   gym "day in, day out", preparing for Saturday's match against Jeamie
   'TKV' Tshikevaat at Derby's Vaillant Arena.

   The fight was originally scheduled for October, but had to be
   rescheduled after TKV suffered an injury in training.

   The 34-year-old from Burton-upon-Trent said his training meant he had
   barely seen his children but they would appreciate it when their dad
   became a British champion.

   He was still that 11-year-old boy who used to go on YouTube and watch
   all the greats, he said, listing fighters such as Muhammad Ali, Ricky
   Hatton, Lennox Lewis, Mike Tyson, Sugar Ray Leonard and Roy Jones as
   his inspirations.

   "I'm still that kid inside, you know this doesn't feel like work to
   me," he said.

   "It's hard, don't get me wrong, but I still love the sport. I'm very
   privileged to be able to do my passion as a living."

'Missed family holidays'

   The boxer won his bronze medal at Tokyo in 2020 in the Men's Super
   Heavyweight category.

   An earlier attempt at winning the heavyweight title ended in a draw and
   then defeat against current WBO world champion Fabio Wardley.

   against Kamil Sokolowski in the heavy-weight bout at the AO Arena,
   Manchester PA Media

   Clarke turned professional after winning bronze at the 2020 Olympics.

   "I've got a 12-week-old daughter," Clarke said, "I've barely seen her."

   "I've got two other beautiful kids. They had six weeks' holidays - I
   didn't get to do the usual stuff, the holidays, the trips and that.

   "I was in this gym day in, day out.

   "But listen, they'll appreciate it because their dad is going to become
   British heavyweight champion."

   His training at the Lions Den Boxing Club in Heanor, Derbyshire, has
   included strength and conditioning sessions.

   "We all come with our plans, but at the end of the day boxing is not
   scripture," trainer Angel Fernandez said.

   "You know we're going to have to be able to adjust and that's what we
   have been preparing for [with] this game - to be able to adjust
   throughout the rounds."

   The match will be shown live on BBC Two from 20:00 GMT as boxing
   returns to BBC terrestrial TV after 20 years.

   There is also radio commentary on BBC Radio Derby and BBC Sounds from
   18:00.

Key Takeaways

     * Dreams can reveal unconscious thoughts, feelings, and desires about
       people.
     * Dreaming of someone does not mean they are thinking about you.
     * Understanding your dreams can help you grow and find peace within
       yourself.

   If you've ever had a dream about someone unexpected, such as an ex,
   co-worker, or crush, you might wonder why they might appear in your
   dreams. While dreams are often centered on daytime thoughts and
   concerns, they can also reflect unconscious thoughts or feelings about
   others. In other cases, dreams symbolically represent something else
   entirely.

   Understanding what dreaming about another person means can provide
   insight into things you may be thinking or worrying about, potentially
   without even realizing it. Read on to start to decode your dreams and
   what they might say about you.

Dreaming About Someone Can Reveal Unconscious Feelings

   The psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud played a significant role in connecting
   dream interpretation to the field of psychology. Freud suggested that
   dreams are one way to access the unconscious mind, which he described
   as a vast reservoir of thoughts, feelings, and desires hidden from
   conscious awareness.

   Even though the contents of the unconscious are not directly
   accessible, Freud still believed that these thoughts, memories, and
   desires could still have an influence on behavior. Freud also believed
   the unconscious could be explored through processes such as dream
   analysis, free association, hypnosis, Freudian slips, and
   psychoanalysis.

   Freud believed that bringing unconscious information to light could
   help alleviate psychological distress. If dreaming about someone has
   left you upset, distressed, or just plain baffled, exploring your
   dream's meaning may help you make sense of what it might mean.

Breaking Down Your Dreams of Someone Else

   According to Jesse Lyon, a licensed mental health counselor and owner
   of Lyon Counseling in Casselberry, Florida, before we can understand
   what it means to dream about someone, it is essential to first
   understand that dreams communicate information on two different levels.
   These levels are known as the manifest content and the latent content.

   Sigmund Freud famously described these two aspects of dreams in his
   seminal book "The Interpretation of Dreams." Freud suggested that
   dreams were highly symbolic and contained literal meanings (the
   manifest content) and symbolic meanings (the latent content).

Manifest Content of Dreams

   The manifest content of a dream refers to the actual events and images
   that take place within the dream. This is the imagery and storyline
   that you remember upon waking. If you dream about someone, the manifest
   content would be the details about that individual, their appearance,
   the events that take place, and the interactions you have within the
   dream.

   "Manifest content is very literal and will communicate with you
   directly about a problem you have or situation you experienced," Lyon
   explains. "For example, you might dream about getting into an argument
   with your romantic partner because you are currently experiencing
   conflict in your relationship; this is pretty straightforward dream
   processing."

   Another example might be having a dream about attending a concert with
   a close friend you haven't seen in a long time. The manifest content
   would be the events, your friend's words and reactions, and the other
   sensory and perceptual elements you experience as a dreamer.

   The manifest content may not, however, necessarily reflect the
   underlying meaning of the dream. It is through analyzing the latent
   content--or the symbolic meaning--that you might get a better idea of
   what your dream might mean.

Latent Content of Dreams

   The latent content of a dream, Lyon notes, is much more personal and
   emotional. This involves the subconscious meaning of the dream, or what
   dream interpreters would say is the hidden meaning behind your dream.
   In the previous example of arguing with a partner, Lyon explains, it
   might mean that the person is struggling with feeling unworthy of their
   partner's love.

   Dreaming about a friend you haven't seen in years might symbolically
   represent a subconscious yearning for reconnection or a desire to find
   closure for unresolved feelings. Or it might indicate a broader desire
   for more social connection and companionship in general.

Examples of Dream Symbolism

   "If you ever see someone show up in your dreams, ask yourself: 'What
   does this person symbolize to me?'" Lyon suggests. If it's your:
     * Boss: It might represent struggles with authority.
     * Mother: You might be dealing with struggles related to femininity
       and self-nurturance.
     * High-school teacher: You might be coping with feeling judged or
       graded.

If You Dream About Romance and Relationships

   What does it mean if you dream about your crush or about dating
   someone? Dreaming about a crush might be about the obvious meaning--you
   are interested in being with them romantically. However, Lyon notes,
   that isn't necessarily the whole story.

   Because dreams have manifest (or literal) content and latent (or more
   symbolic) meanings, it is essential to consider both. The manifest
   content of your dreams might reveal deeper, subconscious meanings that
   are worth exploring, particularly if you have a romantic dream about
   someone who isn't necessarily a potential romantic partner (such as one
   of a friend or boss).

   "Romantic involvement is all about connection," Lyon explains. "So, if
   you are on a date, or even having sex with someone you would not
   expect, that person symbolizes an area of your life that you need to
   connect with more deeply."

Meaning Behind Romantic Dreams About Someone

   According to Lyon, these dreams might be more about:
     * Control over your own life: "If you dream about having sex with
       your boss, you may not actually want to have sex with them, but you
       definitely need to consider how you connect with your own authority
       and assertiveness over your life's direction."
     * Letting go of emotional baggage: "If you dream about having sex
       with your ex, you may not actually want to get back with them, but
       you should definitely consider what unresolved baggage from your
       past that you need to connect with and let go."
     * Personal growth: "If you dream about having sex with your friend,
       think about what are the most important characteristics of your
       friend. Chances are your mind is trying to teach you how to grow as
       a person and connect with those admirable personality traits."

   3 Dream Interpretation Tips, From a Psychotherapist

What Dreaming About Someone Can Tell Us

   Dreams can provide insights into our subconscious thoughts, feelings,
   desires, and fears. They can also offer a perspective that can help
   deepen your relationships in ways that support connection and mental
   well-being.

   Lyon notes it is important to remember that all the roles we play in
   life act as characters that live inside our minds. The characters we
   play (such as parent, partner, friend, or colleague) make up the
   complete picture of who we are as individuals.

   Whenever we are visited by someone in our dreams, we need to consider
   the literal meaning, but then go deeper to think about how that person
   in our dreams is teaching us to connect with a new character that lives
   inside us.
   -- JESSE LYON, LMHC, LYON COUNSELING

   "By learning to understand and accept all of the different characters
   that live inside of us, we become more complete as a person and can
   then love others with greater empathy and understanding," Lyon says.

Dream Interpretation Is Not One-Size-Fits-All

   It is important to remember that dream interpretation is highly
   personal. The specific meaning of someone appearing in a dream depends
   on factors that are unique to you. Examining your dreams and trying to
   understand their meanings, both literal and symbolic, can give you
   greater insights into your own thoughts, emotions, and relationships.

   "That's the power of dreams!" Lyon says. "To help us grow and
   understand ourselves in ways that we could never do while awake and,
   from these insights, find peace within ourselves and carry that peace
   to others."

Frequently Asked Questions

     * Does dreaming of someone mean they are thinking of you?
       No. Dreaming about someone is a reflection of your own thoughts and
       subconscious feelings versus an indication of how they are feeling
       or thinking about you. That's why it is important not to make
       inferences about what others might think based on your dreams.
     * Can two people have the same dream?
       While two people can certainly dream about the same topic or have
       similar dreams, their dreams would still differ in various ways.
       Similarities in dreams are most likely due to factors such as
       shared experiences, connections, and cultural influences. For
       example, two friends who attended the same event might have dreams
       with similar elements.
       Common dream themes do exist that often show up in many people's
       dreams. Some things that people commonly dream about include being
       late, falling, flying, school-related activities, sex, and being
       chased.

                       The Dream of the Universal Library

Monica Westin

   The Internet promised easy access to every book ever written. Why can't
   we have nice things?

   At the turn of the millennium, Google Books and similar mass
   digitization projects for the world's print books were widely seen to
   promise a universal digital library for reading access on the web.
   Instead, the future we thought we'd get for human readers has arrived
   only for machines.

   "Search changes everything," declared Kevin Kelly, the founding editor
   of Wired magazine, in his 2006 New York Times Magazine cover story,
   "Scan This Book!," written a few years into the Google Books project.
   Kelly described a rosy future in which future digital books would be
   cross-linked and wired together to "flow into the universal library as
   you might add more words to a long story." Kelly bemoaned how Congress'
   then recent extension of copyright terms to the life of the author plus
   70 years would keep much of the universal library dark, at least
   temporarily. But he predicted that copyright law would eventually
   "adapt," as its reign would be "no match" for the technology of search.
   Ultimately, he thought, "the screen will prevail." At that time -- one
   of techno-optimism, predating the dominance of social media -- this was
   the majority position.

   The minority position was best expressed a few years earlier by Michael
   Gorman, then president-elect of the American Library Association. In a
   2004 LA Times op-ed, he described Google's newly announced project to
   mass digitize and make searchable huge numbers of books as an
   "expensive exercise in futility." Because copyright limitations meant
   that much of what a reader could access would be only decontextualized
   snippets, Gorman argued, the project wouldn't be useful for the
   dissemination of knowledge. "The books in great libraries are much more
   than the sum of their parts," he wrote. Google Books, he predicted,
   would be a "solution in search of a problem."
   Anagh Banerjee

   Twenty years later, Gorman's take has proved more prescient than
   Kelly's. The vast majority of Google's digitized books exist as
   snippets stuck in a zombie state: under copyright but out of print. It
   is, however, one of the many absurdities of our moment that the company
   likely grants full access to most of the books in its archive to at
   least one party: its own LLMs. Other companies have settled for
   pirating -- an option familiar to most non-institutional researchers.
   The social costs of keeping so many of the world's digitized books
   locked away are far-reaching: knowledge gaps, weaker scholarship,
   stalled innovation, inequitable access, and market failure for the
   low-demand titles that have dropped off publisher backlists.

   It doesn't have to be this way. Almost all the infrastructure we now
   use to find, access, and read books in virtual environments --
   including the first mass book digitization projects, the metadata for
   making them discoverable, and the authentication processes for
   accessing credentials to read them -- has existed for two decades. So
   why are the vast majority of digitized books still inaccessible on the
   web?

   Ask almost anyone, and the answer you'll get is "fair use." Fair use is
   a doctrine that permits the limited use of copyright material. It is
   decided on a case-by-case basis, and it has shaped the major digitized
   book lawsuits of our time.

   I argue that there is another approach. Instead of trying to rewrite
   copyright law itself, we could pursue common-sense reforms: nimble new
   licensing models that open up the digital stacks. The US proposed this
   approach a decade ago, and Europe has since put one into practice. We
   tried to build the universal library at a moment of digital optimism.
   This is the moment to try again.

Making the stacks virtual

   The earliest digital libraries were developed in the 1960s by
   universities and military R&D groups. These connected relatively small
   sets of archived texts or abstract-only databases to basic information
   retrieval systems. As computing power became cheaper and network
   bandwidth increased, projects grew in scope and complexity. In 1971,
   Michael S. Hart, a student at the University of Illinois, digitized the
   text of the American Declaration of Independence and shared it with
   everyone on campus via local ARPANET, one of the earliest computer
   networks. The resulting project became Project Gutenberg, a web-based
   library of public domain books that's often described as the first true
   online digital library.

   By the mid-1990s, digital library projects linking basic library
   holdings information were starting to be developed across Europe and
   the United States. Among the best known was The European Library, a web
   portal launched in 1997 that hyperlinked the collections of several
   European national libraries. University libraries were also starting to
   create their own institutional repositories, often using homegrown
   software. These smaller digital libraries soon began to be quilted
   together through both aggregator sites and protocols for sharing data.
   The dream of the universal digital library, which could contain all
   online content and link it together, began to take form. But it still
   contained only a relatively tiny amount of full-text content.

   Google, in fact, grew out of one such project. Larry Page and Sergey
   Brin began developing what would become Google search while they were
   PhD students working on the Stanford Integrated Digital Library
   Project. The self-stated ambition of SIDLP was to be the "glue"
   connecting all digital content on the web into a comprehensive,
   functional collection.

   By 2004, it seemed like all the components of a digital universal
   library were falling into place. New generation web search and indexing
   created the ability to find content via browsers. WorldCat, the world's
   largest catalog for library collections worldwide, had just opened its
   records. Web crawlers now had a list of book titles, publication dates,
   and other key data. The rest of the backbone was solidifying. Optical
   character recognition (OCR) could turn scanned images into searchable
   text, while ASCII and HTML provided standardized formats that made text
   accessible in any browser and easy for search engines to index.
   Digitized books could finally be integrated into the wider web of
   knowledge.

   The most important component, though, was the books themselves. Fresh
   off its IPO, Google announced at the 2004 Frankfurt Book Fair their
   plans to index every book ever published, a project then called Google
   Print. Google invested massively in the project, which partnered with
   major research libraries at universities including Harvard, the
   University of Michigan, and Oxford. In exchange, library partners would
   typically get their own digitized copy of scanned volumes to preserve
   and use where law allows, such as providing full open access for
   public-domain items. Most of Google's library partners added their
   digitized copy to HathiTrust, a digital library founded in 2008 by a
   consortium of research libraries that aggregates, preserves, and serves
   partner scans.

   Other groups were also uploading scanned books to the web, but the only
   other organization working at the same scale was the Internet Archive.
   The Internet Archive had begun scanning books in 2004 and stepped up
   its pace in 2005. This included some scanning done as part of a
   consortial project called the Open Content Alliance, a partnership
   across the Internet Archive, many university libraries, and, for a
   short time, Microsoft, that sought to counter Google's efforts. When
   the Open Content Alliance petered out, the Internet Archive kept up
   ambitious levels of book scanning on its own.

   These projects captured the public imagination, but the legal problems
   were obvious early on. While technoutopians like Kelly viewed copyright
   law as a temporary obstacle, librarians, archivists, and especially
   attorneys recognized its likely intractability. US copyright law states
   that only the copyright holder can make and distribute copies of a
   work, with very limited fair use exceptions, such as excerpting quotes.
   In most circumstances, anyone making massive numbers of copies of books
   wouldn't fall under fair use exceptions.

   Both Google's and the Internet Archive's projects tested fair use in
   two major lawsuits.  The entire online landscape bears their imprint
   today.

   From the beginning, Google's model had been to form independent
   agreements with library scanning partners and let the rights holders
   find out afterward. It likely would have come as no surprise to Google
   when the Authors Guild, the country's largest professional organization
   for writers, filed a class action lawsuit for copyright infringement
   soon after the inception of the project. In 2008, Google and the
   AuthorsGuild proposed a settlement: Google would pay$125million and set
   up a book rights registry, where rights holders could register their
   copyright claims for books. Google also offered to share future
   revenues with authors and publishers, as well as sell full-text access
   to out-of-print books unless an author opted out. A judge threw out the
   settlement, arguing that this would give Google a near monopoly on the
   millions of still-copyrighted "orphan" works, where the rightsholder
   can't be located.

   While the decision was controversial, had it gone differently it would
   have solved many of the problems we see today, including creating
   access to the vast majority of digitized books that are out of print
   but under copyright. Google was willing to make as many out-of-print,
   copyrighted books as accessible as possible and, critically, to create
   infrastructure that would allow opt-out processes to scale.

   Google won on fair use exception grounds, but the victory -- at least
   for those who dreamed of a universal library -- proved pyrrhic. The
   judge ruled that letting end users see "snippets" constituted a
   transformative public good that didn't compete with book sales. Some
   Google competitors and antitrust-focused groups claimed a win, but the
   ruling meant that, once again, it would be up to Congress to create a
   new legal vehicle for dealing with out-of-print copyrighted books,
   including orphan works. Congress hasn't moved anything forward since.

   More recently, the Internet Archive faced its own fair use exception
   lawsuit in 2020. The Internet Archive was one of many libraries and
   content platforms that had been experimenting with a new, legally
   unsettled approach to lending scanned books called controlled digital
   lending, in which libraries replace a physical copy of a resource they
   own with a digital copy in a "one for one" approach. For example, if a
   library owns one physical copy of Moby Dick, in a CDL model the library
   would scan the book and lend the digital copy made to one patron at a
   time while also removing the original physical copy of the novel from
   circulation.

   But the Internet Archive veered wildly away from a measured approach to
   CDL when in March 2020, during COVID library closures, it enacted a
   short-lived "National Emergency Library" for its scanned books. For a
   few months, the emergency library allowed everyone to simultaneously
   borrow the same scan, abandoning the CDL one-copy, one-user model. In
   response, a group of major publishers filed a lawsuit (Hachette Book
   Group, Inc. v. Internet Archive). In March 2023, a federal court held
   that the Internet Archive's scanning-and-lending program was not fair
   use. An appeal by the Internet Archive was overruled.

The way forward

   These lawsuits on fair use exceptions to core copyright law remain the
   dominant frame for public conversations about digital book access. But
   it's the wrong way to think about it. We don't have to overhaul
   copyright law, or parameters of fair use, to solve the problem of
   access to most digitized books. We do need a practical framework to
   make them available through new licensing exceptions and governance in
   cases where they are commercially unavailable.

   How big is this problem? The most common estimate is that 70% of all
   digitized books are neither in the public domain nor commercially
   available in print. Google has never published an up-to-date rights
   breakdown of its Books corpus, and the only hard numbers Google put on
   the public record came in during the lawsuit, when the first
   sevenmillion library-scanned books were under scrutiny. Of these, about
   one million were public domain, one million were under copyright and in
   print, and the remaining five million were under copyright but out of
   print, including many orphan works. No one has a clean way to license
   these, so they sit in legal limbo, inaccessible to everyone -- except,
   perhaps, Gemini.

   What's needed for the 70% is a new common-sense licensing framework: a
   limited, opt-out system that lets a trusted body grant permission to
   use books no longer on sale, without taking away the authors' rights so
   there's a clear, reliable way to make them available. A new collective
   license model wouldn't please copyleft activists who want to reform
   copyright altogether and would require some extra work from key groups
   to create processes for opt-outs. But it would better serve almost
   everyone else in the space, including librarians (like myself), who
   want to provide legal and low-risk access to their patrons and, of
   course, readers.

   The EU implemented exactly this kind of "out-of-commerce" framework in
   its 2019 Digital Single Market directive, which was designed to create
   efficient online business operations across all EU member states. This
   included an "out-of-commerce works" regime that allows cultural
   heritage institutions to make such works available online once a
   license has been issued or if the rightsholder hasn't opted out of a
   public notice. In practice, this means that if a work isn't available
   through the ordinary marketplace, cultural heritage institutions like
   libraries can work with a collective management organization (the US
   equivalent of this would be the Copyright Clearance Center) to make
   them available -- unless the rightsholder opts out.

   To do this in the US, Congress would have to pass a new standard
   collective license framework. This would allow institutions like
   libraries and archives to make digital versions of in-copyright,
   out-of-commerce books in their collections available for reading
   online. The Copyright Clearance Center would be the obvious group to
   manage the opt-out registry and license admin, and libraries themselves
   to surface the content -- the same major research libraries that worked
   with Google and other organizations to scan their books.

   This is a complex but surmountable task. The Copyright Clearance Center
   would need to build a registry, a portal for posting notices and
   opt-outs, and a process to notify libraries about opt-outs. The work
   required of libraries would be low to moderate, depending on how
   automated the opt-out workflow would be.

   This new model would deliver what the proposed Google Books settlement
   got right, including a rights registry and opt-outs. But we wouldn't
   need a single private tech platform in charge to build it. And
   crucially, we wouldn't have to rewrite the core of US copyright,
   including who owns what and how long it lasts, or expand definitions of
   fair use.

   If this all sounds unrealistic, it's first worth noting that the
   Copyright Office outlined just such an approach for mass books
   digitization in 2015 (Copyright Clearance Center CCC.pdf), issuing a
   report recommending that Congress authorize a pilot for exactly this
   type of extended collective licensing. Congress didn't act.

   These licenses exist for other media in the US. The music industry long
   had a compulsory license laid out in Section 115 of the US Copyright
   Act, which guarantees anyone the right to reproduce and distribute a
   nondramatic musical work as long as they follow the statutory rules and
   pay a set royalty. (This was most recently updated in 2021 by the Music
   Modernization Act in 2018, which replaced the original song-by-song
   "notice of intention" system with a blanket licence for streaming and
   downloads.)

   Finally, we are already living in a moment when new type content
   licenses for books are being churned out at speed. The publishing
   industry is currently scrambling to develop new licensing models for
   full-text book access as lucrative data sources for AI. Just this
   September, Anthropic agreed to pay $1.5 billion to authors and
   publishers after a judge found it illegally downloaded millions of
   copyrighted books from pirate libraries like Library Genesis. About
   500,000 authors will receive $3,000 per work.

   If we can negotiate grand bargains to keep feeding the machines books,
   surely we can design a rational, lean, humane licence that lets living,
   breathing readers borrow a digital copy of a work that they can't buy.
   The universal library is near, but it's up to us to ensure that humans,
   not just AIs, have a card.

   A long-time Indiana football fan is headed to the Rose Bowl.

   Bill Murphy, who lives to the east of Indianapolis, has been an IU
   season ticket holder for 66 years!

   The vast majority of those have been losing seasons with a few bright
   spots, few and far between.

   Indiana's only previous Rose Bowl experience was in 1968, which they
   lost.

   For Murphy, this trip is the chance to fulfill a lifelong dream.

   He was 15 the last time IU headed to California for the Rose Bowl and
   wasn't allowed to go.
   BE THE FIRST TO COMMENT

   IU plays Alabama on New Year's Day in the Rose Bowl, which Murphy will
   be at!

   ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY, Md. (7News) -- A Maryland mother decided it was
   time to pursue her childhood dream in her early 50s, with encouragement
   from her daughter. After two years of hard work, she graduated from
   nursing school.

   7News Health and Wellness Reporter Victoria Sanchez first met Carrie
   Rodevick and her daughter, Rachel Gwin, in 2023. Sanchez and the
   mother-daughter duo sat inside a classroom at Anne Arundel Community
   College after enrolling in nursing school together.

   "Well, I have always wanted to be a nurse," Rodevick told Sanchez two
   years ago.

   Decades ago, Rodevick got married, had two children, and soon became
   the breadwinner of the family. She thought her dream would remain just
   that.

   "And then with my little catalyst over here who's like, `Just do it,
   mom,'" Rodevick said in 2023, referencing her daughter.

   "My whole life, ever since, I feel like the first time I remember her
   saying it, I was 5 years old, is her saying, `I wish I was a nurse,'"
   Gwin said.

   Two years after that interview, Sanchez caught up with Rodevick, who
   had recently graduated with her hard-earned degree.

   "Just finding out what I really can do has been incredible," she said.

   Two days before her 55th birthday, Rodevick walked across the stage at
   Anne Arundel Community College during the pin ceremony.

   "My words of advice are do not think that you do not have it in you to
   realize what is your dream," she said. "And, I would say lean on your
   support, people."

   She accepted a position as a nurse in a hospital cardiology unit and
   started in early January. As for her daughter, she decided to switch
   paths and is currently in school to become a paramedic.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- A few days before the NCAA women's volleyball
   national championship, Texas A&M opposite hitter Logan Lednicky posted
   an old family video on her Instagram account. Lednicky is maybe 5 or 6
   years old in the video, wearing a maroon A&M shirt and doing cartwheels
   on the grass at Kyle Field, A&M's football stadium. "Say 'Gig 'Em,
   Aggies,'" her mom, Leigh Lednicky, implores her, and little Logan walks
   up to the camera, smiles and gives a thumbs-up.

   Under the video, Lednicky wrote that she is living in that little
   Aggie's "answered prayers."

   Her dad, Kyle, was a long snapper for the Texas A&M football team in
   the 1990s, and her mom worked in the football office. She chose Texas
   A&M because she always dreamed of being a fourth-generation Aggie, but
   that was only part of it. She wanted to help build a middling
   volleyball program into a powerhouse.

   Lednicky went beyond that little girl's dreams Sunday, swatting 11
   kills to lead Texas A&M to a sweep over No. 1 seed Kentucky for the
   program's first national title. The senior from Sugar Land, Texas, was
   a linchpin in the Aggies' improbable December postseason run, helping
   her team knock off three No. 1 seeds in the NCAA tournament.

   [check.png&h=80&w=80] Logan Lednicky said it was her goal to elevate
   the Texas A&M program, but the national championship was "beyond my
   wildest dreams." Scott Winters/Icon Sportswire

   In the final four matches of her career, when it mattered most,
   Lednicky amassed 69 total kills, a team high. She's one of four seniors
   who have been with the program from the beginning -- they went 13-16 as
   freshmen -- and set the tone for the historic season. The past and
   present swirled through that class Sunday. With the Aggies cruising in
   the final set, coach Jamie Morrison high-fived Lednicky, and hung on to
   her hand.

   "I think she had that moment where, 'This might be the last four points
   of my college career,'" Morrison said. "I think she actually started
   getting a little teary on the court. I was like, 'Oh, no, did I just
   ruin everything?' No, it means the world.

   "There was a group of them here from the beginning that said, 'I want
   to be a part of this, I want to build this program.' ... I don't think
   they were envisioning a national championship by the time they were
   done. I think when we were selling what we were doing, it was building
   something they could come back to in the future and be really, really
   proud they helped build."

   It was Lednicky who helped save the season on Dec. 13 in the Sweet 16,
   when the Aggies were down two sets to Louisville. She hammered a
   team-high 20 kills in a reverse sweep, and afterward, Lednicky
   mentioned a random note that someone left on the scorer's table as her
   team was teetering toward elimination.

   The note said, "Something great is about to happen."

   She has always been the charismatic optimist -- the one who keeps
   things loose. Teammates call her everything from their "ride-or-die" to
   a best friend.

   She has been a recruiter. When Morgan Perkins hit the transfer portal
   after her freshman season at Oklahoma three years ago, her first text
   came from Lednicky, an old club teammate. Perkins said the text was
   something along the lines of, "Hey, Mo-Mo, I see you're in the portal
   ..."

   Lednicky, along with sophomore Kyndal Stowers, helped pull A&M together
   when the Wildcats sprinted out to a 15-9 lead in the first set. The
   Aggies later said they dealt with some jitters at the start of the
   match, but it was short-lived. Lednicky's kill drew A&M within one, and
   then she teamed up with Perkins for a block that tied the game.
   Stowers' kill completed the rally and gave the Aggies the set, 26-24.

   From there, the Aggies dominated. They took a commanding 19-8 lead in
   the second and pulled away in the third with a Lednicky kill that made
   it 18-11.

   "I was pretty emotional all day today," Lednicky said, "just knowing
   that no matter the outcome of this game, it would be my last getting to
   represent A&M on my chest. Being able to do this with these girls --
   end like this, I just can't even believe it.

   "I'm so happy I get to carry this with me through the rest of my life
   and remember all the memories with these girls."

   In the waning moments of the match, a corner of the arena chanted, "Why
   not us?" It became a slogan for the Aggies in the postseason, during
   the match against Louisville. Late Sunday, Lednicky gave a shoutout to
   her boyfriend and teammate Ava Underwood's boyfriend for coining it for
   the Aggies at a concession stand in Lincoln, Nebraska.

   "We kind of took it and ran with it," she said. "We started saying it.
   Ava and Addi (Applegate) wrote it on their shoe. Now it's on a T-shirt
   somehow. Shout out to them.

   "But, I mean, it's true. It's a testament to the hard work this program
   has put in all year long, staff, players. That's such a great
   statement. 'Why not us' has turned into, 'It is us'. I think with that
   dawg mentality all season long, all tournament long, we knew it was
   going to be us."

   Morrison, who came to A&M in December 2022 and overhauled the program's
   culture, figured it would take at least five years to win it all. He
   credited the rapid ascent to his team's work ethic.

   Kyle Lednicky waited for his daughter after the match, marveling over
   how she and her teammates set out to change a program and did it so
   quickly, and dramatically. He said former A&M football coach R.C.
   Slocum texted her Sunday morning and wished her luck.

   "That was pretty cool," Kyle Lednicky said.

   Of course he always hoped his daughter would go to his alma mater, but
   he says he never put pressure on her. Maybe it was osmosis, that all
   those football games, and that maroon clothing, would eventually seep
   into her consciousness, and her heart. It didn't matter. That
   fourth-generation Aggie is now a first-generation champion.

   Kyle Lednicky saw his daughter's Instagram post Thursday, and it
   brought back a flood of memories.

   "I had to put it away," he said, "because I got teary-eyed when I was
   looking at it."

Mets News & Buzz: Mets dream about Tarik Skubal; Cody Bellinger seems to be

   Despite making a series of moves to reinforce the lineup and the
   bullpen, the New York Mets have yet to really address the rotation.
   Since the Detroit Tigers have said they would listen to offers for ace
   Tarik Skubal, there is a chance they have talked to the Mets.

   No deal appears imminent, though, as it's unlikely they trade the best
   pitcher in baseball. Meanwhile, the Mets also seem to be losing hope of
   landing Cody Bellinger.

The Mets may have launched a massive trade offer for Tarik Skubal

   The Mets' most intriguing path to true contention runs straight through
   Detroit, where Skubal's future remains quietly unresolved. While the
   Tigers continue to signal they want to keep their ace, Skubal's
   impending free agency creates a narrow but real window for a
   blockbuster trade.

   Industry chatter suggests Detroit is listening, even if they aren't
   advertising it, and that uncertainty is exactly what David Stearns
   would need to strike before the Tigers risk losing elite value for a
   single draft pick.

   Skubal isn't just another frontline starter -- he's a transformational
   force. His dominance in 2025 placed him among the most overpowering
   pitchers in modern baseball, backed by elite command, swing-and-miss
   stuff, and underlying metrics that scream sustainability. Adding him
   would instantly change the Mets' identity, turning a hopeful rotation
   into one capable of carrying a deep postseason run.

   The cost, however, would be massive. Any realistic deal would start
   with Jett Williams and likely include Jonah Tong plus another
   high-upside bat or athlete. It's a painful price for a potential
   one-year rental, but it's also the kind of gamble that can alter a
   franchise's trajectory. For a team chasing championships rather than
   comfort, Skubal represents the rare move that could justify the risk.

The Mets outfield is speeding toward a disaster as Cody Bellinger slips away

   Juan Soto may be the most dangerous hitter in baseball, but he's
   currently standing in the middle of an outfield vacuum. David Stearns'
   aggressive teardown has cleared payroll and reset the roster, yet it
   has also stripped the Mets of stability on both sides of Soto. With
   Brandon Nimmo and Jeff McNeil gone, the outfield depth chart looks
   thin, uncertain, and far from playoff-ready.

   Cody Bellinger remains the ideal solution -- a power bat, elite
   defender, and positional chameleon perfectly suited for Citi Field. But
   with the Yankees positioned as favorites to retain him, the Mets may be
   forced to pivot toward less inspiring alternatives.

   That reality pushes Stearns toward creative trade options or short-term
   fixes, players who can hold the line until top prospect Carson Benge is
   ready to assume a full-time role.

   The bigger concern is what all of this signals about the Mets'
   timeline. Despite internal messaging about run prevention and
   competitiveness, the roster still lacks a true ace and multiple
   everyday outfielders. Even with Soto anchoring the lineup, the current
   construction feels more transitional than complete -- a rebuild wearing
   contender's clothing. The vision may be sound, but for now, Soto looks
   isolated while the rest of the puzzle remains unfinished.

Algiers revives its dream of a Hollywood epic for Emir Abd El-Kader

   After several failed attempts, a film is set to be dedicated to this
   hero of resistance against French colonial conquest, with the active
   support of President Abdelmadjid Tebboune.

   Emir Abd El-Kader, in 1865 Emir Abd El-Kader, in 1865 Emir Abd
   El-Kader, in 1865 WIKIPEDIA

   Emir Abd El-Kader (1808-1883) lived a thousand lives, including forging
   a national destiny that Algiers has been trying to bring to the big
   screen since the 1970s. During a meeting on December 8, President
   Abdelmadjid Tebboune revived the project to produce a feature film on
   the extraordinary life of the man known as the "greatest enemy of
   France."

   This decision carries strong political symbolism, as relations between
   Paris and Algiers have entered a period of unprecedented tension since
   Algeria's independence. The latest episode in this fraught relationship
   unfolded on December 24, when Algerian lawmakers passed a law
   criminalizing colonization. France promptly denounced this as an
   "obviously hostile initiative."

   'reparations' from France for its colonial past

   A political and military genius, a learned strategist respected even by
   his fiercest adversaries, El-Kader was the iconic leader of Algerian
   resistance to the French conquest in the 19^th century. For 15 years,
   he outmaneuvered one of the most powerful armies of his era, until his
   surrender in 1847. While in exile in Damascus, he took up arms to save
   the lives of several thousand Christians threatened by persecution from
   the Druze. This act earned him worldwide recognition, from Pope Pius IX
   to American President Abraham Lincoln. His humanism was celebrated in
   lengthy poems by Victor Hugo and Arthur Rimbaud.

V158: I Dream Of Jennie

   Jennie's fame didn't dissolve her enigma. Instead, it gave her new
   tools to sculpt it

   December 31, 2025
     * Text by Mathias Rosenzweig

   On April 10th, 2012, South Korean pop culture giant YG Entertainment
   posted a cryptic photo to their official blog. In the image, a girl
   looks off-camera, dressed in a pink-and-white checkered shirt, with
   auburn streaks running through her black hair. Simply titled "WHO'S
   THAT GIRL???," the breadcrumb was part of a teaser campaign for a
   forthcoming new girl group. One month later, a YouTube video with the
   same name appeared online--a one-minute, 36-second hypnotic clip of
   trainees dancing in the shadows, except for one girl, illuminated in a
   tight spotlight as she performs, her face too distant to capture, her
   dance movements too precise and charismatic to ignore. The video has
   since been viewed nearly twenty-four million times. Finally, on August
   29th of the same year, YG unveiled the girl in question: Jennie Kim (),
   a sixteen-year-old trainee fluent in Korean, English, and Japanese.
   Fast forward 13 years, and Jennie is one of the most famous women in
   the world. Yet visibility is not the same as transparency; despite
   being everywhere, she remains, in some ways, just as elusive as that
   shadowed girl in the teaser. So, who is that girl with 89 million
   Instagram followers? It's a mystery sustained not by secrecy, but by
   evolution--Jennie is always in motion, and always beginning again.

   "I can't believe I'm still saying this," Jennie begins over Zoom from
   Manila, Philippines, just days after our cover shoot in Los Angeles,
   "because it's something I said a year ago before my first album [Ruby],
   but I feel like a baby stepping into the world." That curiosity and
   wide-eyed wonder regarding her career's possibilities remain a constant
   throughout our conversation--childlike, but never childish. Though she
   jokes, "You're not allowed to say that!" when I mentioned her
   forthcoming thirtieth birthday, she speaks of the new decade with a
   spirit of inquiry rather than dread. "I just can't wait for this new
   chapter of mine to open, not because I'm entering my 30s, but because
   there are just so many exciting things that I've planned ahead," she
   explains. "I feel like I lived my 20s with passion and love." She also
   lived them with a fastidious work ethic (BLACKPINK has sold over 20
   million records worldwide and was the first K-pop girl group to
   dominate charts in the West, with her aforementioned debut solo album
   debuting in the top 10 in 19 countries). "As far as I know, I'm going
   to be in Tokyo. I'm going to have a show the night of my birthday, and
   that whole week too," she says--a fitting celebration for someone whose
   dedication borders on superhuman.

   The parallel to William Klein's 1966 film Who Are You, Polly Maggoo?--a
   key ingredient in the Twiggy-tinged, '60s-infused cocktail of a
   moodboard behind our cover shoot--is irresistible. In that satirical
   portrait of the Paris fashion world, a young American model named Polly
   Maggoo becomes the obsession of designers, photographers, and TV crews,
   all determined to uncover her "true self." The more they search, the
   more she disappears beneath projections of beauty and desire. "Every
   time they take my picture," Polly famously sighs, "there's a little
   less of me left."

   Jennie's career, too, has unfolded beneath an unblinking camera eye.
   Yet what distinguishes her from Klein's tragic mannequin is agency. She
   has learned to command the lens rather than be consumed by it. If Polly
   Maggoo dissected a culture that devoured its idols, Jennie represents a
   generation of artists reclaiming authorship over their image. "Through
   my debut album Ruby, which came out this year--although it feels like
   four years ago--it was a great way for me to explore new sounds and
   just rediscover myself and my love for music, and find new ways to
   approach it," she says. "The decisions, the thought process, and ideas
   are coming 100% from me. It feels like I own everything. So it
   definitely taught me how to talk to myself." Thus, while Jennie--like
   Polly--finds herself surrounded by stylists eager to dress her, makeup
   artists to glam her, and producers to shape her sound, she is no
   passive canvas, but an active hand in her own creation.

   With new solo music coming this year, Jennie is deciding how her future
   will look--and sound. "I honestly have no clue what it's gonna look
   like yet. I am a very open book right now," she admits. "I'm excited to
   get deeper with my vocals for sure. And this was homework of mine from
   the beginning, but blending Korean and English into my music, too."
   Perhaps surprisingly, given her refined and immaculate public image,
   she speaks of horror and thriller films as new terrain for inspiration.
   "I just watched the movie Weapons. Have you watched it?" she asks.
   "I've always been a fan of horror and thriller movies. I love the
   aesthetics. I've also watched (Guillermo del Toro's) Frankenstein,
   which is in that world. Something about the dark, mysterious places and
   visuals in those films always inspired me to get into it more. Maybe
   that could be something that I could embrace in my own creativity."

   As far as who Jennie will be, she remains open to exploring various
   creative mediums. "I see lots of artists directing their own things or
   designing their own costumes to wear in their videos. I want to say,
   although I don't know if I'm allowed to say this, but I love fashion
   and would love to design something for myself." Of course, the world of
   fashion loves her right back--Jennie is a style icon and Fashion Week
   fixture, her presence at Chanel's front row regularly creating such a
   frenzy that even Polly Magoo would be jealous.

   Even in her downtime away from the flashing bulbs, Jennie is a curious
   being. "I really don't know if I should say this," she begins timidly,
   "But I'm on the plane half of the time and in the car or getting glam,
   so I've been playing Nintendo Switch. Animal Crossing, Zelda, and Mario
   Kart. Everyone knows I'm not a professional at it, but you know, it
   takes everything off my mind." When I remind her that she doesn't have
   to be a master of this pastime, she interjects: "That's the thing--once
   I get really deep into it, I want to become a professional. So I'm very
   invested in these games right now." Sometimes, a strong work ethic
   can't help but infringe on good ol' fashioned fun.

   There will be no shortage of planes or cars for Jennie this month as
   she and the rest of BLACKPINK conclude their DEADLINE World Tour. She
   speaks of returning to the stage after a three-year hiatus with a
   surprising sense of comfort, although not immediately: "Obviously, all
   of us were not afraid, but we didn't know what to expect going back
   into the group and being on tour after three years." When asked if it
   felt like a homecoming, as well as how "home" had changed, she says,
   "Nothing has really changed, but also, we've all released solo albums,
   too. So being able to bring different music into our sets and watching
   each other's performances from a new perspective was a new thing for
   us, which made it more fun." Despite her own solo music and that of her
   counterparts (Lisa, Jisoo, and Rosé--all, as with Jennie, mononymous
   like Madonna), the girls do not act as though they are in competition.
   "Overall, being back on stage with all of us together felt very much
   like home. When you don't go home for a year because of work or
   whatever, and you go back, and it still feels like home...it's that
   kind of feeling where you don't need to expect anything. Your body
   knows that you're home."

   In this light, Jennie's "home" is one of massive success, though she
   still grapples with how to define the word. "That's a serious question
   that I ask myself every day," she says. "But for me, I think...getting
   to look at my own dedication to something that I made and whatever is
   being shared with the world, and if I feel proud of it, if I feel like
   it's mine, that's the moment where I'm like, you know, `I'm doing
   great, and I feel like my life's good.'"She pauses, then adds: "If
   someone asked me how I'm handling my success, I would say I'm not. But
   I am proud of how far I've come. I'm proud of all the work I've made.
   Just the fact that I get to look back at myself, dream bigger, and keep
   going--that's my way of handling life." Where Polly Maggoo ends in
   existential uncertainty, its protagonist wandering the lonely streets
   of Paris, Jennie's story lands on evolution. The ambiguity
   persists--not as absence, but as freedom. We may never fully know who
   Jennie Kim is, and perhaps that's the point, because she is a
   shapeshifter not lost in the gaze but guiding it. In a world still
   obsessed with unmasking its icons, Jennie's remains a mystery, but
   unlike Magoo, it's one of her own making.

An American Dream at risk: What happens to a small Nebraska town when 3,200
workers lose their jobs

   beef plant, Dec. 3 in Lexington, Neb. (Thomas Peipert/Associated Press)

   LEXINGTON, Neb. - On a frigid day after Mass at St. Ann's Catholic
   Church in rural Nebraska, worshippers shuffled into the basement and
   sat on folding chairs, their faces barely masking the fear gripping
   their town.

   A pall hung over the room just as it hung over the holiday season in
   Lexington, Nebraska.

   "Suddenly they tell us that there's no more work. Your world closes in
   on you," said Alejandra Gutierrez.

   She and the others work at Tyson Foods' beef plant and are among the
   3,200 people who will lose their jobs when Lexington's biggest employer
   closes the plant next month after more than two decades of operation.

   Hundreds of families may be forced to pack up and leave the town of
   11,000, heading east to Omaha or Iowa, or south to the meatpacking
   towns of Kansas or beyond, causing spinoff layoffs in Lexington's
   restaurants, barbershops, grocers, convenience stores and taco trucks.

   "Losing 3,000 jobs in a city of 10,000 to 12,000 people is as big a
   closing event as we've seen virtually for decades," said Michael Hicks,
   director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Indiana's
   Ball State University. It will be "close to the poster child for hard
   times."

   All told, the job losses are expected to reach 7,000, largely in
   Lexington and the surrounding counties, according to a report from the
   University of Nebraska, Lincoln, released Monday. Tyson employees alone
   will lose an estimated $241 million in pay and benefits annually.

   Tyson says it's closing the plant to "right-size" its beef business
   after a historically low cattle herd in the U.S. and the company's
   expected loss of $600 million on beef production next fiscal year.

   The plant's closure threatens to unravel a Great Plains town where the
   American Dream was still attainable, where immigrants who didn't speak
   English and never graduated high school bought homes, raised children
   in a safe community and sent them to college.

   Now, those symbols of economic progress -- mortgages and car payments,
   property taxes and tuition costs -- are bills that thousands of Tyson
   workers won't have an income to pay.

   At St. Ann's church, Gutierrez sat between her daughters and recalled
   being told of the plant closure just before Thanksgiving while she
   visited a college campus with her high school senior, Kimberly.

   "At that moment, my daughter said she no longer wanted to study,"
   Gutierrez said. "Because where would we get the money to pay for
   college?"

   A tear slipped down Kimberly's cheek as she looked at her mother and
   then down at her hands.

   `Tyson was our motherland'

   If you threw a dart at a map of the United States, Lexington -- called
   "Lex" by locals -- would be just about bullseye.

   It's easy to miss driving down Interstate 80, half hidden by barren
   hackberry trees, corn fields and pastures of Black Angus cattle, but a
   driver can spy the plant's hulking industrial buildings pumping steam.

   The plant opened in 1990 and was bought by Tyson 11 years later,
   attracting thousands of workers and nearly doubling the town's
   population within a decade.

   Many came from Los Angeles, then stricken by recession, including
   Lizeth Yanes, who initially hated what she called "a little ghost
   town."

   But soon Lexington flourished, with suburbs sprouting among bur oak and
   American elm trees. The downtown, a strip of cobblestone streets and
   brick buildings, has a Somali grocer that abuts a Hispanic bakery;
   locals attend over a dozen churches and several city recreation
   centers.

   To this day, the plant creates the town's rhythm as workers roll on and
   off the daily A, B and C shifts and fill restaurants, school pickup
   lines and the one-screen movie theater showing "Polar Express."

   "It took a long time for me to actually enjoy this little place," said
   Yanes. "Now that I enjoy it, now I have to leave."

   The atmosphere inside the Tyson plant, where workers process as many as
   5,000 head of cattle a day, laboring on slaughter floors, cleaning
   crews or trimming cuts of meat, feels "like a funeral," she said.

   "Tyson was our motherland," said plant worker Arab Adan. The Kenyan
   immigrant sat in his car with his two energetic sons, who asked him a
   question he has no answer to: "Which state are we gonna go, daddy?"

   The only thing Adan is set on is that his kids finish the school year
   in Lexington, where school officials say nearly half of students have a
   parent working for Tyson.

   The school district, where at least 20 languages and dialects are
   spoken, has higher high school graduation and college attendance rates
   than the state and national average, and one of Nebraska's biggest
   marching bands. Residents are proud of the diversity and the tightknit
   community, where young people return to raise families.

   During Mass at St. Ann's, parishioners gave the cash in their pockets
   to a fund for families in financial need, despite knowing they'll be
   out of work next month. Afterward, Francisco Antonio ran through his
   future employment options with a sad smile.

   After the plant closes on Jan. 20, the 52-year-old father of four said
   he'll stay a few months in Lexington and look for work, though "now
   there's no future." He took off his glasses, paused, apologized and
   tried to explain his emotions.

   "It's home mostly, not the job," he said, replacing his glasses with an
   embarrassed smile.

   "We need another opportunity, job, here in Lex," he said. "Otherwise
   Lex is gonna disappear."

   `Tyson owes this community'

   The domino effect could go something like this: If 1,000 families skip
   town, said economist Hicks -- who wouldn't be surprised if it were
   double that -- seats would be left empty in schools, leading to teacher
   layoffs; there would be far fewer customers in restaurants, shops and
   other businesses.

   Most of the customers at Los Jalapenos, a Mexican restaurant down the
   street from the plant, are Tyson workers. They fill booths after work
   and are greeted by owner Armando Martinez's mustachioed grin and bellow
   of "Hola, amigo!"

   Martinez's grandson once told his grandfather that when he grows up he
   wants to work at Tyson. The child's fifth-grade sister recently
   gathered with classmates to talk about the changes happening with their
   parents. Some were headed to California, others to Kansas. All were in
   tears.

   If he can't keep up with bills, the restaurant will close, but "there's
   just nowhere we can go," said Martinez, who undergoes dialysis for
   diabetes, has an amputated foot and prays for a miracle: that Tyson
   will change its mind.

   He knows it's unlikely. Asked by The Associated Press for comment about
   plans for the site, Tyson said in a statement that it "is currently
   assessing how we can repurpose the facility within our own production
   network." It did not provide details, or say whether it plans to offer
   support to the community through the plant closure.

   Many, including City Manager Joe Pepplitsch, are hoping Tyson puts the
   plant up for sale and a new company comes in bringing jobs. That isn't
   a quick fix, requiring time, negotiations, renovations and no guarantee
   of comparable jobs.

   "Tyson owes this community a debt. I think they have a responsibility
   here to help ease some of the impact," he said, noting Tyson doesn't
   pay city taxes due to a deal negotiated decades ago.

   `It's not easy, at our age, to go back and start over'

   Near the plant, at the Dawson County Fairgrounds, Tyson workers
   recently filled a long hall as state agencies -- responding with the
   urgency of a natural disaster -- offered information on retraining,
   writing a resume, filing for unemployment and avoiding scammers when
   selling homes.

   Attendees' faces were subdued, like listening to a doctor's prognosis.
   "Your financial health is going to change," they were told. "Don't
   ignore the bank, they will not go away."

   Many of the older workers don't speak English, haven't graduated high
   school and aren't computer savvy. The last application some filled out
   was decades ago.

   "We know only working in meat for Tyson, we don't have any other
   experience," said Adan, the Kenyan immigrant.

   Back at St. Ann's, workers echoed that concern.

   "They only want young people now," said Juventino Castro, who's worked
   at Tyson for a quarter-century. "I don't know what's going to happen in
   the time I have left."

   Lupe Ceja said she's saved a little money, but it won't last long. Luz
   Alvidrez has a cleaning gig that will sustain her for awhile. Others
   might return to Mexico for a time. Nobody has a clear plan.

   "It won't be easy," said Fernando Sanchez, a Tyson worker for 35 years
   who sat with his wife. "We started here from scratch and it's time to
   start from scratch again."

   Tears rolled down his wife's cheeks and he squeezed her hand.

A Venezuelan family's Christmas: From the American dream to poverty

   Mariela Gómez and thousands of Venezuelan immigrants have faced a
   challenging Christmas after Donald Trump returned to the White House in
   January

   MARACAY, Venezuela -- This was not the Christmas that Mariela Gómez
   would have imagined a year ago. Or the one that thousands of other
   Venezuelan immigrants would have thought. But Donald Trump returned to
   the White House in January and quickly ended their American dream.

   So Gómez found herself spending the holiday in northern Venezuela for
   the first time in eight years. She dressed up, cooked, got her son a
   scooter and smiled for her in-laws. Hard as she tried, though, she
   could not ignore the main challenges faced by returning migrants:
   unemployment and poverty.

   "We had a modest dinner, not quite what we'd hoped for, but at least we
   had food on the table," Gómez said of the lasagna-like dish she shared
   with her partner and in-laws instead of the traditional Christmas dish
   of stuffed corn dough hallacas. "Making hallacas here is a bit
   expensive, and since we're unemployed, we couldn't afford to make
   them."

   Gómez, her two sons and her partner returned to the city of Maracay on
   Oct. 27 after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border to Texas, where they were
   quickly swept up by U.S. Border Patrol amid the Trump administration's
   crackdown on immigration. They were deported to Mexico, from where they
   began the dangerous journey back to Venezuela.

   They crossed Central America by bus, but once in Panama, the family
   could not afford to continue to Colombia via boat in the Caribbean.
   Instead, they took the cheaper route along the Pacific's choppy waters,
   sitting on top of sloshing gasoline tanks in a cargo boat for several
   hours and then transferring to a fast boat until reaching a jungled
   area of Colombia. They spent about two weeks there until they were
   wired money to make it to the border with Venezuela.

   Gómez was among the more than 7.7 million Venezuelans who left their
   home country in the last decade, when its economy came undone as a
   result of a drop in oil prices, corruption and mismanagement. She lived
   in Colombia and Peru for years before setting her sights on the U.S.
   with hopes of building a new life.

   Trump's second term has dashed the hopes of many like Gómez.

   As of September, more than 14,000 migrants, mostly from Venezuela, had
   returned to South America since Trump moved to limit migration to the
   U.S., according to figures from Colombia, Panama and Costa Rica. In
   addition, Venezuelans were steadily deported to their home country this
   year after President Nicolás Maduro, under pressure from the White
   House, did away with his long-standing policy of not accepting
   deportees from the U.S.

   Immigrants arrived regularly at the airport outside the capital,
   Caracas, on flights operated by a U.S. government contractor or
   Venezuela's state-owned airline. More than 13,000 immigrants returned
   this year on the chartered flights.

   Gómez's return to Venezuela also allowed her to see the now 20-year-old
   daughter she left behind when she fled the country's complex crisis.
   They talked and drank beer during the holiday knowing it might be the
   last time they share a drink for a while -- Gómez's daughter will
   migrate to Brazil next month.

   Gómez is hoping to make hallacas for New Year's Eve and is also hoping
   for a job. But her prayers for next year are mostly for good health.

   "I ask God for many things, first and foremost life and health, so we
   can continue enjoying our family," she said.

Cleworth's 'mad' Wrexham journey as dream continues

   Max Cleworth joined Wrexham at the age of 12 and made his senior club
   debut as a 17-year-old against Ayr United

   As a 23-year-old who was playing National League football as recently
   as 2023, Max Cleworth could have been forgiven if he found the
   Championship a tough league to crack.

   But the central defender is the only player in Phil Parkinson's ranks
   to start all 18 of his side's matches in the second tier so far this
   season, such is the trust the coaching staff have in the academy
   product.

   And while nowhere close to retirement, Cleworth - who has played in
   different divisions in four successive seasons - says the scale of his
   own and the club's recent achievements may not sink in until he hangs
   up his boots.

   "It's a bit mad to think of, where we were a few years ago," he said.

   "It's something that I'll probably look back on once I've retired and
   just try and enjoy it at the moment."
     * Wrexham AFC

   Wrexham have gone from strength-to-strength in the Championship, with
   their last-gasp draw against Blackburn Rovers extending their unbeaten
   league run to eight matches.

   Following a blunt opening 60 minutes at the Stok Cae Ras, the hosts
   ended strongly and in the fifth minute of added time had Cleworth's
   calf to thank for diverting Nathan Broadhead's shot into the net.

   "I'm going to claim it even though it was scruffy," said Cleworth.

   "I think it's come off the bottom of my calf in the end. I'm not sure
   how it's come off my calf but I've tried to get something on it and
   thankfully it's gone in."

   It was the defender's first goal of the campaign, and Cleworth - who
   netted eight times in League One last term - now hopes he can
   contribute more in front of goal after breaking his Championship duck.

   "I've been a bit frustrated that maybe I haven't got one or two,"
   Cleworth said.

   "I've had a couple of good chances that have either not quite got the
   connection or gone wide or been saved, so it's nice to finally get off
   the mark and hopefully I'll get a few more."

   Parkinson: It's a `decent' point

   Andri Gudjohnsen's early header for Rovers brought an end to Wrexham's
   run of 375 minutes without conceding a Championship goal.

   But the draw with Valerien Ismael's side means Wrexham have not lost at
   home in the league in seven matches - a pivotal factor in the Red
   Dragons' rise up the table.

   "It's massive for us, that home form and having the fans behind us
   week-in week-out when we play," Cleworth said.

   "We didn't start (the season) great, it took a bit of time to gel.

   "I think if we can keep that fiery atmosphere going, it's hard for
   teams to come here and play and get anything."

   With Wrexham just three points adrift of the top six ahead of next
   Saturday's trip to play-off chasing Preston North End, the 2025-26
   season could well be another memorable one for the north Wales side.

   Having been a key cog in each of his side's three consecutive
   promotions under Hollywood owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney,
   Cleworth knows better than most that the sky is the limit for the club
   at present.

   "I don't see why we can't be right up there," declared Cleworth.

   "The Championship's infamous for anyone beating anyone, so if you can
   try and be as consistent as possible, you can see yourself fly up the
   league a bit, so I don't think we can put any restrictions on
   ourselves.

   "We can be right up there and hopefully with a few more runs like this,
   we could be fighting for potentially promotion, so who knows.

   "We won't get carried away with ourselves. It only takes a few losses
   in this league to bring you straight back to reality so we'll just
   focus on the next game and then the game after that and see where we
   end up."

Despair for would-be US citizens as American dream blocked by Trump

   Aspirant Americans tell of exclusions from ceremonies by sudden policy
   introduced on `security' grounds


   Robert Tait in Washington

   The occasion should have been marked by the joy of reaching the
   destination of US citizenship following the long odyssey of
   immigration.

   Instead, the ceremony at Boston's Faneuil Hall - renowned as a "cradle
   of liberty" for its role as a protest hub in the run-up to the American
   revolution - felt like a nightmarish end of the road for some aspirant
   new Americans who had turned up full of hope.

   Before proceedings at this month's event got under way, staff from the
   US Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) asked arrivals expecting
   to swear the oath of allegiance that would finally confirm them as
   citizens to state their country of origin.

   deportations in the US

   Those from nations included on a travel ban list announced by Donald
   Trump last summer were then excluded from taking part, despite having
   completed the years-long vetting process.

   Among the disappointed was a Haitian nursing assistant in her 50s who
   had lived in the US for nearly 25 years - denied what immigration
   specialists say is her legal right by a sudden policy change introduced
   by the Trump administration on "security" grounds.

   The woman declined an interview request. But Gail Breslow, executive
   director of Boston-based Project Citizenship - which had helped guide
   her citizenship application - said she was left devastated and
   distraught.

   "Our client hadn't received USCIS's written notification on time and
   turned up expecting to become a citizen," Breslow said. "She told us
   she was not alone in this and the same thing happened to others.

   "The image of officers going down a line and asking people where they
   were born, and based on the answer that they gave, pulling them out of
   line and sending them home is gut-wrenching.

   "We had another client there the same day from Honduras who was allowed
   to take part and sent us pictures of his naturalization. People are
   holding little flags and it's a image of pride and joy as people are
   surrounded by family members - the contrast between that and people
   being plucked out of line based on what country they're from is the
   most un-American image I can conjure."

   The scene has been replicated in venues elsewhere in response to a
   USCIS memorandum sent out on 5 December instructing that immigration
   proceedings be paused for the nationals of 19 countries on Trump's ban
   list.

   The memo followed the shooting on 26 November of two national guard
   troops in Washington DC, allegedly by an Afghan national, Rahmanullah
   Lakanwal, who had been granted asylum earlier this year by the Trump
   administration.

   "In light of identified concerns and the threat to the American people,
   USCIS has determined that a comprehensive re-review, potential
   interview, and re-interview of all aliens from high-risk countries of
   concern who entered the United States on or after January 20, 2021 is
   necessary," read the memo, which cites the shooting of the national
   guards as a justification for the review.

   The memo prompted a flood of emails to applicants awaiting
   naturalization informing them that the ceremonies had been canceled.

   "This is to advise you that, due to unforeseen circumstances, we have
   had to cancel the previously scheduled Oath Ceremony on Wednesday,
   December 03,2025 at 12:30PM for the above applicant," one typical email
   seen by the Guardian read. "We regret any inconvenience this may
   cause."

   Advocacy groups report oath ceremonies being called off in
   Philadelphia, New York, Los Angeles, Miami, Milwaukee, Houston, St
   Louis, Omaha and elsewhere.

   "We have seen these cases now in over 16 cities, affecting
   nationalities that include Iranians, Haitian, Sudanese, Yemen,
   Venezuelan, Afghan, Sierra Leonean, Guinean, Libyan, just to name
   quickly some of the countries [proscribed]," said Greg Chen, senior
   director for government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers
   Association.

   of fear

   Prohibitions also apply to green-card applicants and those applying for
   naturalization but who have not yet reached the stage of taking the
   oath of allegiance.

   "We're talking about [the cancellation of] three types of things -
   green-card interviews, naturalization interviews and then ... an oath
   ceremony where it's kind of finalized," said Chen.

   Most of those affected refuse to speak to the media, fearing that
   publicity could make them targets for reprisals or raids carried out by
   Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents enforcing Trump's
   immigration agenda, which has been marked by mass deportations of
   undocumented people.

   However, a Libyan doctor - emailing the Guardian anonymously at the
   request of his lawyer - said his green-card application had been halted
   despite having worked in the US for 10 years after entering on an
   O-1/EB-1 (extraordinary ability) visa.

   "I never imagined that in the United States I would be targeted because
   of my nationality and religious background, particularly by the
   authorities," wrote the doctor, whose medical work is focused on
   developing AI diagnostic and treatment tools for lung cancer.

   "I invested years of relentless effort in this journey ... I pursued
   the American dream in good faith, believing in this country as a land
   of opportunity.

   "Now, as I reach the final stages of my permanent residency process, an
   expensive and lengthy process, my future appears jeopardized solely
   because of my country of origin. I can't describe to you the
   uncertainty, fear, disappointment and confusion I feel right now."

   Such feelings are commonplace among groups suddenly fearing their path
   to citizenship is shutting.

   "We've had clients in tears asking us, what did they do wrong," said
   Breslow of Project Citizenship, which has seen 21 clients receive oath
   ceremony cancellations and more than 200 being paused at an earlier
   stage. "What did they do to deserve this? People are very distraught."

   Emotions are running particularly high among Afghans, nearly 200,000 of
   whom arrived in the US under the Biden administration's Operation
   Allies Welcome program that followed the 2021 military withdrawal from
   Afghanistan. Many now feel singled out and betrayed after the national
   guard shootings, according to advocates.

   "We feel guilt and shame that that guy was part of our community," said
   Fatima Saidi, director of We Are All America, a refugee and immigrants
   group. "But he was also a part of American militarism. He joined the US
   army when he was 15 and was trained."

   In fact, Lakanwal was part of an Afghan unit that operated under CIA
   direction.

   "We also feel guilty for other communities because policies that are
   targeting Afghans are also affecting them," she added. "But the other
   thing is just hopelessness and disappointment, especially among the
   Afghans who came here as allies. Most of them feel they have done so
   much for America, the veterans and the state department."

   Nicole Melaku, executive director of the National Partnership for New
   Americans, said the collective demonizing of legal residents and
   citizenship applicants had ominous portents.

   "The strategy of the administration began with an assault on
   undocumented immigrants, and now he [Trump] is going after those with
   legal status and trying to move them into his deportation pipeline
   through administrative processes," she said.

   "Everything here feels like part of a larger, ominous agenda to have
   exclusion, going back to times where we had the Chinese Exclusion Act
   or other operations in the 1940s like sending people back to Mexico."

   Her warning was given added weight by guidance issued last week to
   USCIS field offices that signalled a forthcoming assault on the
   citizenship of Americans already naturalized.

   Trump

   The new guidance instructed offices to "supply Office of Immigration
   Litigation with 100-200 denaturalization cases per month" during the
   2026 fiscal year, the New York Times reported, targets that would
   amount to a massive escalation of denaturalization cases. By
   comparison, only 120 were filed from 2017 to 2025.

   Federal law mandates that citizenship can only be withdrawn if holders
   committed fraud while applying. But a justice department memo sent to
   its civil division last June ordered denaturalization cases to be
   prioritized and appeared to lay down broader parameters.

   "It says they're going to prioritize denaturalization cases against
   people who furthered criminal gangs, people who committed felonies that
   were not disclosed, and people who engaged in fraud against private
   individuals," an immigration policy expert, speaking on condition of
   anonymity, said. "Those categories don't require criminal convictions.

   "Only certain cases can be denaturalized under the law, although this
   administration is trying to stretch the parameters of what that means.

   "People who have had their naturalization interviews and ceremonies
   canceled ... and then also stripping citizenship from already
   naturalized Americans - they're like two halves of the same coin to
   make more of our community members subject to detention and
   deportation."

Mets News & Buzz: Mets dream about Tarik Skubal; Cody Bellinger seems to be

   Despite making a series of moves to reinforce the lineup and the
   bullpen, the New York Mets have yet to really address the rotation.
   Since the Detroit Tigers have said they would listen to offers for ace
   Tarik Skubal, there is a chance they have talked to the Mets.

   No deal appears imminent, though, as it's unlikely they trade the best
   pitcher in baseball. Meanwhile, the Mets also seem to be losing hope of
   landing Cody Bellinger.

The Mets may have launched a massive trade offer for Tarik Skubal

   The Mets' most intriguing path to true contention runs straight through
   Detroit, where Skubal's future remains quietly unresolved. While the
   Tigers continue to signal they want to keep their ace, Skubal's
   impending free agency creates a narrow but real window for a
   blockbuster trade.

   Industry chatter suggests Detroit is listening, even if they aren't
   advertising it, and that uncertainty is exactly what David Stearns
   would need to strike before the Tigers risk losing elite value for a
   single draft pick.

   Skubal isn't just another frontline starter -- he's a transformational
   force. His dominance in 2025 placed him among the most overpowering
   pitchers in modern baseball, backed by elite command, swing-and-miss
   stuff, and underlying metrics that scream sustainability. Adding him
   would instantly change the Mets' identity, turning a hopeful rotation
   into one capable of carrying a deep postseason run.

   The cost, however, would be massive. Any realistic deal would start
   with Jett Williams and likely include Jonah Tong plus another
   high-upside bat or athlete. It's a painful price for a potential
   one-year rental, but it's also the kind of gamble that can alter a
   franchise's trajectory. For a team chasing championships rather than
   comfort, Skubal represents the rare move that could justify the risk.

The Mets outfield is speeding toward a disaster as Cody Bellinger slips away

   Juan Soto may be the most dangerous hitter in baseball, but he's
   currently standing in the middle of an outfield vacuum. David Stearns'
   aggressive teardown has cleared payroll and reset the roster, yet it
   has also stripped the Mets of stability on both sides of Soto. With
   Brandon Nimmo and Jeff McNeil gone, the outfield depth chart looks
   thin, uncertain, and far from playoff-ready.

   Cody Bellinger remains the ideal solution -- a power bat, elite
   defender, and positional chameleon perfectly suited for Citi Field. But
   with the Yankees positioned as favorites to retain him, the Mets may be
   forced to pivot toward less inspiring alternatives.

   That reality pushes Stearns toward creative trade options or short-term
   fixes, players who can hold the line until top prospect Carson Benge is
   ready to assume a full-time role.

   The bigger concern is what all of this signals about the Mets'
   timeline. Despite internal messaging about run prevention and
   competitiveness, the roster still lacks a true ace and multiple
   everyday outfielders. Even with Soto anchoring the lineup, the current
   construction feels more transitional than complete -- a rebuild wearing
   contender's clothing. The vision may be sound, but for now, Soto looks
   isolated while the rest of the puzzle remains unfinished.

Algiers revives its dream of a Hollywood epic for Emir Abd El-Kader

   After several failed attempts, a film is set to be dedicated to this
   hero of resistance against French colonial conquest, with the active
   support of President Abdelmadjid Tebboune.

   Emir Abd El-Kader, in 1865 Emir Abd El-Kader, in 1865 Emir Abd
   El-Kader, in 1865 WIKIPEDIA

   Emir Abd El-Kader (1808-1883) lived a thousand lives, including forging
   a national destiny that Algiers has been trying to bring to the big
   screen since the 1970s. During a meeting on December 8, President
   Abdelmadjid Tebboune revived the project to produce a feature film on
   the extraordinary life of the man known as the "greatest enemy of
   France."

   This decision carries strong political symbolism, as relations between
   Paris and Algiers have entered a period of unprecedented tension since
   Algeria's independence. The latest episode in this fraught relationship
   unfolded on December 24, when Algerian lawmakers passed a law
   criminalizing colonization. France promptly denounced this as an
   "obviously hostile initiative."

   'reparations' from France for its colonial past

   A political and military genius, a learned strategist respected even by
   his fiercest adversaries, El-Kader was the iconic leader of Algerian
   resistance to the French conquest in the 19^th century. For 15 years,
   he outmaneuvered one of the most powerful armies of his era, until his
   surrender in 1847. While in exile in Damascus, he took up arms to save
   the lives of several thousand Christians threatened by persecution from
   the Druze. This act earned him worldwide recognition, from Pope Pius IX
   to American President Abraham Lincoln. His humanism was celebrated in
   lengthy poems by Victor Hugo and Arthur Rimbaud.

V158: I Dream Of Jennie

   Jennie's fame didn't dissolve her enigma. Instead, it gave her new
   tools to sculpt it

   December 31, 2025
     * Text by Mathias Rosenzweig

   On April 10th, 2012, South Korean pop culture giant YG Entertainment
   posted a cryptic photo to their official blog. In the image, a girl
   looks off-camera, dressed in a pink-and-white checkered shirt, with
   auburn streaks running through her black hair. Simply titled "WHO'S
   THAT GIRL???," the breadcrumb was part of a teaser campaign for a
   forthcoming new girl group. One month later, a YouTube video with the
   same name appeared online--a one-minute, 36-second hypnotic clip of
   trainees dancing in the shadows, except for one girl, illuminated in a
   tight spotlight as she performs, her face too distant to capture, her
   dance movements too precise and charismatic to ignore. The video has
   since been viewed nearly twenty-four million times. Finally, on August
   29th of the same year, YG unveiled the girl in question: Jennie Kim (),
   a sixteen-year-old trainee fluent in Korean, English, and Japanese.
   Fast forward 13 years, and Jennie is one of the most famous women in
   the world. Yet visibility is not the same as transparency; despite
   being everywhere, she remains, in some ways, just as elusive as that
   shadowed girl in the teaser. So, who is that girl with 89 million
   Instagram followers? It's a mystery sustained not by secrecy, but by
   evolution--Jennie is always in motion, and always beginning again.

   "I can't believe I'm still saying this," Jennie begins over Zoom from
   Manila, Philippines, just days after our cover shoot in Los Angeles,
   "because it's something I said a year ago before my first album [Ruby],
   but I feel like a baby stepping into the world." That curiosity and
   wide-eyed wonder regarding her career's possibilities remain a constant
   throughout our conversation--childlike, but never childish. Though she
   jokes, "You're not allowed to say that!" when I mentioned her
   forthcoming thirtieth birthday, she speaks of the new decade with a
   spirit of inquiry rather than dread. "I just can't wait for this new
   chapter of mine to open, not because I'm entering my 30s, but because
   there are just so many exciting things that I've planned ahead," she
   explains. "I feel like I lived my 20s with passion and love." She also
   lived them with a fastidious work ethic (BLACKPINK has sold over 20
   million records worldwide and was the first K-pop girl group to
   dominate charts in the West, with her aforementioned debut solo album
   debuting in the top 10 in 19 countries). "As far as I know, I'm going
   to be in Tokyo. I'm going to have a show the night of my birthday, and
   that whole week too," she says--a fitting celebration for someone whose
   dedication borders on superhuman.

   The parallel to William Klein's 1966 film Who Are You, Polly Maggoo?--a
   key ingredient in the Twiggy-tinged, '60s-infused cocktail of a
   moodboard behind our cover shoot--is irresistible. In that satirical
   portrait of the Paris fashion world, a young American model named Polly
   Maggoo becomes the obsession of designers, photographers, and TV crews,
   all determined to uncover her "true self." The more they search, the
   more she disappears beneath projections of beauty and desire. "Every
   time they take my picture," Polly famously sighs, "there's a little
   less of me left."

   Jennie's career, too, has unfolded beneath an unblinking camera eye.
   Yet what distinguishes her from Klein's tragic mannequin is agency. She
   has learned to command the lens rather than be consumed by it. If Polly
   Maggoo dissected a culture that devoured its idols, Jennie represents a
   generation of artists reclaiming authorship over their image. "Through
   my debut album Ruby, which came out this year--although it feels like
   four years ago--it was a great way for me to explore new sounds and
   just rediscover myself and my love for music, and find new ways to
   approach it," she says. "The decisions, the thought process, and ideas
   are coming 100% from me. It feels like I own everything. So it
   definitely taught me how to talk to myself." Thus, while Jennie--like
   Polly--finds herself surrounded by stylists eager to dress her, makeup
   artists to glam her, and producers to shape her sound, she is no
   passive canvas, but an active hand in her own creation.

   With new solo music coming this year, Jennie is deciding how her future
   will look--and sound. "I honestly have no clue what it's gonna look
   like yet. I am a very open book right now," she admits. "I'm excited to
   get deeper with my vocals for sure. And this was homework of mine from
   the beginning, but blending Korean and English into my music, too."
   Perhaps surprisingly, given her refined and immaculate public image,
   she speaks of horror and thriller films as new terrain for inspiration.
   "I just watched the movie Weapons. Have you watched it?" she asks.
   "I've always been a fan of horror and thriller movies. I love the
   aesthetics. I've also watched (Guillermo del Toro's) Frankenstein,
   which is in that world. Something about the dark, mysterious places and
   visuals in those films always inspired me to get into it more. Maybe
   that could be something that I could embrace in my own creativity."

   As far as who Jennie will be, she remains open to exploring various
   creative mediums. "I see lots of artists directing their own things or
   designing their own costumes to wear in their videos. I want to say,
   although I don't know if I'm allowed to say this, but I love fashion
   and would love to design something for myself." Of course, the world of
   fashion loves her right back--Jennie is a style icon and Fashion Week
   fixture, her presence at Chanel's front row regularly creating such a
   frenzy that even Polly Magoo would be jealous.

   Even in her downtime away from the flashing bulbs, Jennie is a curious
   being. "I really don't know if I should say this," she begins timidly,
   "But I'm on the plane half of the time and in the car or getting glam,
   so I've been playing Nintendo Switch. Animal Crossing, Zelda, and Mario
   Kart. Everyone knows I'm not a professional at it, but you know, it
   takes everything off my mind." When I remind her that she doesn't have
   to be a master of this pastime, she interjects: "That's the thing--once
   I get really deep into it, I want to become a professional. So I'm very
   invested in these games right now." Sometimes, a strong work ethic
   can't help but infringe on good ol' fashioned fun.

   There will be no shortage of planes or cars for Jennie this month as
   she and the rest of BLACKPINK conclude their DEADLINE World Tour. She
   speaks of returning to the stage after a three-year hiatus with a
   surprising sense of comfort, although not immediately: "Obviously, all
   of us were not afraid, but we didn't know what to expect going back
   into the group and being on tour after three years." When asked if it
   felt like a homecoming, as well as how "home" had changed, she says,
   "Nothing has really changed, but also, we've all released solo albums,
   too. So being able to bring different music into our sets and watching
   each other's performances from a new perspective was a new thing for
   us, which made it more fun." Despite her own solo music and that of her
   counterparts (Lisa, Jisoo, and Rosé--all, as with Jennie, mononymous
   like Madonna), the girls do not act as though they are in competition.
   "Overall, being back on stage with all of us together felt very much
   like home. When you don't go home for a year because of work or
   whatever, and you go back, and it still feels like home...it's that
   kind of feeling where you don't need to expect anything. Your body
   knows that you're home."

   In this light, Jennie's "home" is one of massive success, though she
   still grapples with how to define the word. "That's a serious question
   that I ask myself every day," she says. "But for me, I think...getting
   to look at my own dedication to something that I made and whatever is
   being shared with the world, and if I feel proud of it, if I feel like
   it's mine, that's the moment where I'm like, you know, `I'm doing
   great, and I feel like my life's good.'"She pauses, then adds: "If
   someone asked me how I'm handling my success, I would say I'm not. But
   I am proud of how far I've come. I'm proud of all the work I've made.
   Just the fact that I get to look back at myself, dream bigger, and keep
   going--that's my way of handling life." Where Polly Maggoo ends in
   existential uncertainty, its protagonist wandering the lonely streets
   of Paris, Jennie's story lands on evolution. The ambiguity
   persists--not as absence, but as freedom. We may never fully know who
   Jennie Kim is, and perhaps that's the point, because she is a
   shapeshifter not lost in the gaze but guiding it. In a world still
   obsessed with unmasking its icons, Jennie's remains a mystery, but
   unlike Magoo, it's one of her own making.

Cleworth's 'mad' Wrexham journey as dream continues

   Defender Max Cleworth applauds fans Image source, PA Media

   Max Cleworth joined Wrexham at the age of 12 and made his senior club
   debut as a 17-year-old against Ayr United

   As a 23-year-old who was playing National League football as recently
   as 2023, Max Cleworth could have been forgiven if he found the
   Championship a tough league to crack.

   But the central defender is the only player in Phil Parkinson's ranks
   to start all 18 of his side's matches in the second tier so far this
   season, such is the trust the coaching staff have in the academy
   product.

   And while nowhere close to retirement, Cleworth - who has played in
   different divisions in four successive seasons - says the scale of his
   own and the club's recent achievements may not sink in until he hangs
   up his boots.

   "It's a bit mad to think of, where we were a few years ago," he said.

   "It's something that I'll probably look back on once I've retired and
   just try and enjoy it at the moment."
     * Wrexham AFC

   Wrexham have gone from strength-to-strength in the Championship, with
   their last-gasp draw against Blackburn Rovers extending their unbeaten
   league run to eight matches.

   Following a blunt opening 60 minutes at the Stok Cae Ras, the hosts
   ended strongly and in the fifth minute of added time had Cleworth's
   calf to thank for diverting Nathan Broadhead's shot into the net.

   "I'm going to claim it even though it was scruffy," said Cleworth.

   "I think it's come off the bottom of my calf in the end. I'm not sure
   how it's come off my calf but I've tried to get something on it and
   thankfully it's gone in."

   It was the defender's first goal of the campaign, and Cleworth - who
   netted eight times in League One last term - now hopes he can
   contribute more in front of goal after breaking his Championship duck.

   "I've been a bit frustrated that maybe I haven't got one or two,"
   Cleworth said.

   "I've had a couple of good chances that have either not quite got the
   connection or gone wide or been saved, so it's nice to finally get off
   the mark and hopefully I'll get a few more."

   Parkinson: It's a `decent' point

   Andri Gudjohnsen's early header for Rovers brought an end to Wrexham's
   run of 375 minutes without conceding a Championship goal.

   But the draw with Valerien Ismael's side means Wrexham have not lost at
   home in the league in seven matches - a pivotal factor in the Red
   Dragons' rise up the table.

   "It's massive for us, that home form and having the fans behind us
   week-in week-out when we play," Cleworth said.

   "We didn't start (the season) great, it took a bit of time to gel.

   "I think if we can keep that fiery atmosphere going, it's hard for
   teams to come here and play and get anything."

   With Wrexham just three points adrift of the top six ahead of next
   Saturday's trip to play-off chasing Preston North End, the 2025-26
   season could well be another memorable one for the north Wales side.

   Having been a key cog in each of his side's three consecutive
   promotions under Hollywood owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney,
   Cleworth knows better than most that the sky is the limit for the club
   at present.

   "I don't see why we can't be right up there," declared Cleworth.

   "The Championship's infamous for anyone beating anyone, so if you can
   try and be as consistent as possible, you can see yourself fly up the
   league a bit, so I don't think we can put any restrictions on
   ourselves.

   "We can be right up there and hopefully with a few more runs like this,
   we could be fighting for potentially promotion, so who knows.

   "We won't get carried away with ourselves. It only takes a few losses
   in this league to bring you straight back to reality so we'll just
   focus on the next game and then the game after that and see where we
   end up."

'How rising costs shattered my restaurant dream'

   25 November 2025

   [grey-placeholder.png] BBC A woman in a red hooded sweatshirt stands
   inside an empty restaurant. It has no chairs and tables and the bar
   behind her is empty. She has red, shoulder-length, bobbed hair, blue
   eyes and freckles, and is looking at the camera. BBC

   Former restaurant owner Kelly Broderick says hospitality businesses are
   "falling like dominoes" due to increases in costs

   Kelly Broderick wipes away tears as she cleans her restaurant ahead of
   handing the keys back to the landlord.

   After eight years, the Newquay resident says "insurmountable" increases
   in costs - from wages to the price of cooking oil - have led her to
   make the "heartbreaking" decision.

   It comes as Cornwall Chamber of Commerce also warns businesses have
   "nothing left to give" ahead of the Budget on Wednesday.

   The government says "pubs, restaurants and cafes are vital to local
   communities" adding it is cutting the cost of licensing and lowering
   their business rates.

   [grey-placeholder.png] A close-up image of two, street-side restaurant
   signs that are inside the front door of a restaurant. They say The Fish
   Bat, Seafood, Tapas.

   Ms Broderick says she found customers were not "coming out as often or
   spending as much as they did"

   Miss Broderick says she took on personal debt to try and keep her
   business afloat but adds she "can't face the rising costs anymore".

   "Wages, National Insurance contributions, product costs, utilities,
   insurance - everything costs so much more than it used to," she
   continues.

   About 80 meals per evening were served at The Fish Bar - Miss
   Broderick's seafood and tapas restaurant, during the busy summer
   months.

   The business had two full-time employees, an apprentice and about 15
   part-time members of staff.

   "You put your heart and soul into building your dream but everything is
   against you," she explains.

   She says she found customers were not "coming out as often or spending
   as much as they did".

   "We just can't face the rising costs anymore," Kelly Broderick said as
   she packed up her closed restaurant

   "Don't come back and ask businesses for more because there is nothing
   left to give," says John Brown, of the Cornwall Chamber of Commerce, to
   Chancellor Rachel Reeves.

   Speaking at a meeting of the Cornwall Hospitality Collective, he
   explains the government needs to do more to "incentivise businesses to
   grow and hire more people", adding the measures announced in the last
   Budget "had not made things any easier".

   The government says it does not comment on speculation around changes
   to tax outside of fiscal events.

   Simon Mahon, chief executive of Watergate Bay Hotel, says he wants some
   good news from the chancellor.

   "I'm hoping for a cut in business rates for those in hospitality, and
   tax relief for businesses that are investing," he explains.

   Mr Mahon adds he also wants to see a review of the impact of the
   increase in employers' National Insurance contributions, which he says
   have had a "punitive" impact on hospitality and led to jobs being lost.

   "Pubs, restaurants and cafes are vital to local communities, that's why
   we're cutting the cost of licensing, lowering their business rates and
   helping more hospitality businesses offer pavement drinks and al fresco
   dining, on top of cutting alcohol duty on draught pints and capping
   corporation tax," a government spokesperson says.

   They also say 43% of employers (865,000) will pay no employer National
   Insurance contributions this year and that the government is supporting
   businesses with expert advice to cut energy bills and emissions.

   Back at The Fish Bar in Newquay, Kelly Broderick says closing the
   business will also be a "relief after all the stress".

   She adds: "You try and make something successful and it's not viable -
   that's what really hurts."

Student lands rugby world cup dream job

   Ashleigh Rollins: Hoping to back on the pitch and playing in 12 months

   A Devon student refused to let a devastating knee injury stop her from
   seizing a dream role at the Women's Rugby World Cup.

   Ashleigh Rollins, 20, from South Molton, spent four weeks working as a
   paid media intern for World Rugby at Sandy Park in Exeter during the
   tournament, while waiting for surgery on a ruptured ligament and torn
   meniscus.

   "It was incredible being picked for the internship and I was determined
   nothing would get in my way," said Ms Rollins, a second-year BA Sports
   Journalism student at Plymouth Marjon University.

   "I found myself spending four weeks straight at Sandy Park, watching
   the games and interviewing some of the biggest names on the planet. And
   I got paid to do it."

   [grey-placeholder.png] Caroline Moore/Exeter Chiefs The image shows two
   people sitting on a blue sofa in what appears to be a lounge or waiting
   area. One person is wearing a bright turquoise jacket with colourful
   stripes on the sleeves and is holding a notepad and pen. The other
   person is dressed in a white sports shirt with a logo and dark shorts.

   Italy and Exeter Chiefs

   Her job was to sit in press conferences, record quotes and send them to
   editors for the Rugby News Service.

   "I'd see my work used by the BBC and other national and international
   media," she said.

   "It was daunting at first as there were other journalists in the room
   but I quickly gained confidence in asking questions."

   Ms Rollins met stars including New Zealand's Braxton Sorensen-McGee and
   Canada's finalists.

   "Even with the smaller teams like South Africa and Fiji it was amazing
   seeing their passion for their sport," she said.

   "And one of the Welsh players reached out to me on Instagram after I'd
   put up a post about my injury. She had the same thing and offered me
   advice and support."

   Just days before England's win in the final, Ms Rollins had surgery on
   23 September.

   "Plymouth Marjon have been very supportive after my injury, and
   especially my lecturers who have been incredibly understanding about
   the situation," she said.

   She said she now wanted to get back in the game she loved playing as
   soon as possible.

   "My physio said that my progress is great. I'm doing everything I
   should be doing and, hopefully, in 12 months' time, I will be back on
   the pitch," she said.

   The mural, which features flowers and insects, makes the owner feel
   like she is sitting in a garden

   A 94-year-old woman says a huge mural painted on the side of her house
   gives her a "dream garden" that she "doesn't need to look after".

   Muriel Baker, from Meare near Glastonbury in Somerset, had her wall
   transformed into a countryside scene.

   She cannot manage the weeding or watering needed for a garden, but this
   option lets her feel as though she's sitting in one while enjoying a
   coffee or tea, she added.

   It is the second mural she has had painted on her house, which she says
   "attracts people from all over".

   Ms Baker told BBC Radio Somerset: "I've not got any garden myself, I
   can't do any gardening and I thought wouldn't it be nice to have a
   garden on the wall."

   The £2,000 mural features her favourite things - flowers, birds, and
   butterflies.

   She said: "I've had a lot of people come and look at it and they really
   enjoy it."

   This is Ms Baker's second mural

   Local artist Jon Minshull painted a farmhouse scene on a separate wall
   at Ms Baker's house.

   In total he has completed nearly 30 murals in the area, including a
   giant giraffe.

   "That one required four stages of scaffolding," he said.

   "It usually takes about a week to complete a house-sized wall."
