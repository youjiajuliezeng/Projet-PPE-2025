on
how

looks

dreaming
has
fascinated
humans
for
centuries

when
you
look
at
ancient
civilizations
,
they
believed
dreams
were
prophecies
or
divine
messages
while
the
exact
purpose
of
dreaming
remains
unclear

most
agree
that

reflects
coordinated
what
part
of
the
brain

dreams
?

has
been
linked
to
self-awareness
during

and
may
play
a
key
role
in

&
what

in
the
brain
dreaming
is
such
a
fascinating
topic
because
everyone
dreams
(
even
if
you
don



t
remember
them
)
,
but
the
experience
of
dreaming
can
vary
from
person
to
person
.
we
do
know
that
most
dreams
last
about
5-20
minutes
,
and
you
can
have
multiple
dreams
in
a
night

the
variability
is
in
the
experience
of
dreaming

recollection
,
and
intensity
(

some
people
remember
their
dreams
vividly
,
and
others

some
have
the

dream
over
and
over
while
others
rarely
repeat
a

only
a

of
dreams
in

the

now

to

just
like
when
reading
mythology
,
dreams
are
not

to
be
interpreted
literally
.
the
language
of
dreams
and
the
unconscious
is
external
environment
to
symbolize
things
in
the
dream
.
for
example
,
in
my
dream
,
the
characters
phillip
and
reid
do
not
actually
refer
to
the
dreams
are
usually
about
the
interior
world
rather
than
the
external

interpret
the
dream
taking
all
the
things
you
wrote
before
,
interpret

remember
that
a
dream
is
a
coherent
message

cloaked
in

when
you
interpret

arrive
at

interpretation

thus
the

should
be

if
you
arrive
at
a
dream
interpretation
that
is
self-congratulatory
interpretation
is
also
incorrect
.
dreams
are
about
you
and
not
others

remember
that
all
the
characters
in
your
dream
represent

do
a
ritual
to

the
my
dream
interpretation
now

i



m
going
to
apply
these
steps
to
my

of
symbols
from

more
i
think
about

why
did
this

show
that
i
was
back
at
my

that
me

what
the
dream
was
really
asking
was

do
you
want
to
be

this
is
the
only

that
feels

interpreting

i
wanted
the
dream
to
have
a
positive
outcome
,
after
the
dream
.
in
the
end
,
the
following
strangely
resonated
:
what
does
this
dream
mean
?

taking
all
the
above
into
account
,
i
now
believe
that
this
dream
is
this
,
but
i
sense
that
this
conclusion
is
true
.
the
dream
seems
to
be
chair
,
so
that
appears
out
as
well
.
the
dream
is
saying
that
i
have
to
what
is
interesting
about
the
dream
is
that
it
actually
had
three
chairs

the
chair
i
was
sitting
on
at
the
beginning
of

dream

the
during

dream

i
will
have
to
think
about
it
in
the
coming
days

usually
in
dream
interpretation
,
the
unconscious
leaves
a
little
clue
in

meantime

completed

acknowledge

of

freud

revolutionized
the
scientific
study
of
dreams
,
and
provided
a
framework
for
the
of
dreams
,
and
so
our
tendency
may
be
to
apply
these
notions
to
the
dreams
we
find
in
novels
written
before
1900
as
well
as
to
those
intuitively
freudian
notion
of
dreaming
.
we
also
assume
that
literary
dreams
operate
in
the
same
manner
as
actual
dreams
(
freud
himself
proposes
this
approach
in
"delusions

assumptions

scrutiny

however
,
if

are
not
real
dreams
(
that

arise
from
a

context

reflect
not
theories
about
dreams
(
from
both
scientific

popular
sources
)
,
as
well
as
conventional
literary
representations
of
dreams

to

freudian
notion

dreaming
is
to
wrench
him
from
his

complex
assumptions

dreams
are
a
mix

the
strange

the
familiar

while
sometimes
in

we

surprisingly
,
the
material

offer
unexpected
ways
to

here
are
three
tools
for
using

and

to

while
we

for

once

in
the

,
the
same
person
knocked
on
my
door
and
,
when
i
in
the
dream
,
i
simply
listened
,
then
shut
the
door
.
but
in
the
morning
,
reflecting
on
the
dream
,
i
asked
myself
whether

the

network
of

that
operates
in

dreams
.
we
think
about
this
cognitive
powerhouse
one
approach
to
understanding
dreams
is
to
view
each
of
the
aspects
of
a
dream
as
an
aspect
of
the
dreamer
.
in
other
words

the
notion
of

occurring
in

has
now
been
put

also
by

that

can
recapitulate

thereby
ruling
out

that

another
common
attempt

is

s
first
argument
,
we
should
not
simply
take
dream

at
face
value
,
as
the

view
has
done
;
dream
reports
are
insufficient
to
believe
the
metaphysical
claim
that
dreaming

to
examine
our
episodic
memories
of

and
put
our
dream
report
into
words
,
these
are
not
the
dream
experiences
themselves
.

primary
claim
that
dreams
are
consciously
experienced
during
sleep
.

establishing
that
one
has
had
a
dream
is
that
one
awakes
with
the
impression
of
having
dreamt
(
that
is
,
an
apparent
memory
)
and
that
one
then
goes
on
to
report
the
dream
.
waking
with
the
impression
does
not
corresponds
to
the
report
.
malcolm
views
dream
reports
as
inherently
first
personal
and
repeatedly
claims
that
the
verbal
report
of
a
dream
is
the
only
criterion
for
believing
that
a
dream
took
place
.
he
adds
that
dreams
cannot
be
checked
in
any
other
way
without
either
showing
of
dreaming
by
relying
on
behavioural
criteria
such
as
patterns
of
their
dreams
,
according
to
malcolm
.
the
best
we
can
get
from
that
are
if
scientists
try
to
show
that
one
is
dreaming
during
sleep
then
those
scientists

it
might
seem
that
lucid

is
an

objection
to

arguments
against

lucid
dreaming
occurs
when
an
individual
is
aware
during
a
dream
that
it
is
a
dream
.

lucid
dreaming
is
therefore
an
example
of
experiencing

the

that
lucid

are
a

that

there
is
evidence
that
different
parts
of
dreaming

pre-frontal
brain
regions
,
pre-cuneus
and
front

regions
)
.
so
there
still
remains
the
possibility
that
lucid
dreaming
is
an
example
of
consciously


waking
up
within
a
dream



whilst
ordinary
dreams
are
taken
care
of
entirely
by
the
unconscious
(
thus
there
is
not
anything-it



s-like
to
have
an
ordinary
dream
occur
during

)
.
it
might
be
useful
to
look
at
one
report
of
the
memory
of
a
lucid
dream
:
dreams
.
finally
,
it
dawns
on
me
:
i
must
be
dreaming
!
(
laberge
&
notice
that
this
is
not
just
the
memory-report
of
a
lucid
dream
.

rather
,
it
is
the
memory-report
of
an
ordinary
dream
turning
into
a
lucid
dream
.
the
report
demonstrates
an
epistemic
transition
within
the
dream
.
with
this
in
mind
,
it
is
difficult
to
maintain
that
lucid
dreams
are
anomalous
,
or
that
lucid
dreams
bring
about
conscious
experience
.

thus
accept
that
the
preceding
ordinary
dream
is
conscious
too
because
whenever
individuals
gain
lucidity
in
their
dreams
,
there
is
a
prior
process
of
gradual
realization
that
is
present
in
the
dream
report
.

when
an
individual
acquires
lucidity
in
a
dream
,
they
are
arguably
the
gradual
transition
from
ordinary
dream
to
lucid
dream
can
be
more
fully
emphasized
.
it
is
possible
to
question
oneself
in
a
dream
whilst
awake
and
ask
another
dream
character
to
hit
oneself
,
apparently
feel
highlight
the
existence
of
partial-lucid
dreams
in
order
to
show
that
dreams
often
involve
irrationality
and
that
there
are
fine-grained
transitions
to
the
fuller
lucidity
of
critical
thinking
in
dreams
.
a
lucid
dream
,
unlike
ordinary
dreams
,
is
defined
strictly
in
terms
of
the
advanced
epistemic
status
of

malcolm
had
argued
that
dreaming
was
worthy
of

dennett
was
sceptical
that

would
turn
out

the
radical
proposal
now
is
that

ought
to
be

for
this

dreaming

myriad
of
problems
with
taking

scientific
model

role
dreaming
can
play

studies

they
reject

to
wakefulness

the

major
problem
with
using

.
hence
there
is
no
accepted
definition
of
dreaming
(
windt
,

)
.
taking
dreaming
as
a
model
system
of
course
requires
and
depends
upon
exactly
what
dreaming
is
characterized
as
.
revonsuo
simply
assumes
his
conception
of
dreaming
is
correct
.
he
believes
that
dreaming
can
be
a
model
of
waking
consciousness
because
dreams
can
be
experiences
.
windt
&
noreika
believe
that
dreams
tend
to
be
different
there
are
further
problems
with
modelling
dreams
.
collecting
dream
reports
in
the
laboratory
might
amount
to
about
five
reported
dreams
a
directly
work
with
dreams
themselves
,
but
rather
descriptions
of
dreams
.
there
is
also
the
added
possibility
of
narrative
fabrication
(
the
difference
between
dream
experience
and
dream
report
)
.
during
the
dream
itself
,
it
is
known
that
we
do
not
have
clarity
of
awareness
as
in
waking
life
and
we
do
have
a
poor
memory
during
the
dream
experience
.
though
lucid
dreaming
is
an
exception
to
this
rule
,
it
differs
from
ordinary
dreaming
and
lucid
dreaming
has
not
been
proposed
phenomenon
properly
but
this
in
itself
can
influence
the
dream
content
it
might
be
very
difficult
to
investigate
dreams
but
this
comes
with
only
that
dreaming
ought
to
be
alongside
it
.
the
fact
remains
,
however
,
that
despite
suggestions
from
revonsuo
and
others
,
dreaming
being
used
contrast
analysis
of
dreaming
with
other
wake
states
should
at
least
be
of
using
dreams
in
a
contrast
analysis
with
waking
life
?
though
waking
the
world
,
dreaming
is
the
second
global
state
of
consciousness
.
as
displayed
in
reports
,
dreams
involve
features
which
are
markedly
key
hallmarks
of
dreaming
but
not
waking
consciousness
.
the
two
states
of
waking
and
dreaming
are
mediated
by
radically
different
predominantly
in
control
and
for
dreaming
the
cholinergic
system

not
ignore

,
but
proposes

more
modest
approach

with
research
divided
between

.
it
is
important
to

is

the
further
proposal
that
dreams
can
be
more
specifically
contrasted
with
dreams
have
been
hitherto
investigated
and
so
has
already
proven
to
be
option
,
however
.
perhaps
modelling

really
would
be
ideal
simply
empirical
dream
research
is
a
commonly
accepted
definition
of
dreaming



of
what
does
and

is
dreaming
an
instance
of
images
or
percepts
?

some
believe
that
dreaming
involves
mental
imagery
of
both
that
dreams
should
only
be
thought
of
in
terms
of
images
(
the
inflate

ontology
and
invoke
a
third
category
that

we
should

that

psychological
state
we
are

or
imaginings
(
ichikawa
,
2009
)
.
this
debate
of
dreaming
is
percept
or
imagining
because
all
four
possible
combinations
can
be
held
:
a
theorist
might
claim
that
dreams
are
dreams
involve
hallucinations
which
we
do
not
generate
belief
,
but
we
are
rather
always
entertaining
our
dream
hallucinations
as
imagined
possibilities
.
alternatively
,
dreams
might
involve
the
psychological
as
though
they
were
real
;
finally
,
dreams
might
involve
imaginings
merely
imagining
that
what
is
perceived
is
the
case
.
so
if
dreams
are
psychologically
defined
in
terms
of
percepts
,
we
can
expect
that
dreams
way
the
world
is
and
so
no

so

according
to
this
line

special

some
scientists
have
considered

s
suggestion
that
dreams
express
lots
of
other
theories
about
what
dreams
might
do
,
many
with
more
simulation
hypothesis
suggests
that
dreams
may
provide
a
sort
of
situations
,
even
if
we
don

remember

reactions
to

suggestion
is
that

way

next
people

dreams
from
their
rem
sleep
definitely
dreams
which
can
wake
you
up
)
may
even
lead
to
ongoing
mood
problems
.

on
the
other
hand
,
there
is
also
evidence
that
dreams
could
help
to
regulate
long-term
mood
.
for
instance
,
a
study
of
dreams
in
divorced
women
showed
that
those
who
dreamed
about
their
ex-husbands
more
often
were
better
adapted
to
the
divorce
.
amazingly
enough
,
dreams
also
seem

,

less
thirsty
when
they
woke
up
.

the
content
of
dreams
can
be
influenced
in
lots
of
different
ways
.
for
dreams
if
nice
smells
are
wafted
at
them
in
rem
sleep
,
and
they
have
negative
or
unhappy
dreams
if
stinky
,
unpleasant
smells
are
sent
their
way
.
some
people
can
achieve
lucid
dreaming
,
in
which
they
control
the
sequence
of
events
in
their
dream
,
and
evidence
suggests
that
these

all

they
have
phobias
into
their
dreams
,
and


when
combined
with
more

the
phobia
.
hypnotic
suggestion
can
also
make
dreams
more

.
the
fact
that
they
can
learn
during
sleep
is
a
different
matter
,
but
dreams
themselves
don



t
appear
to
be
a
good
forum
for

it

to
dream
about
disconnected
snippets
like
a

person
,
place
,
or
activity
.
but
do

;
studies
the
secret
world
of
sleep
of
dreaming
show
that
quite
rare
(
around
2
percent
of
dreams
contain
such
memories
,
according
to
one
study
)
.
most
of
our
dreams
just
recombine
fragments
of
waking
and
concerns
of
the
dreamer
.
this
means
cyclists
dream
about
cycling
,
teachers

about

and

about

on

other
hand
,

more
recently
described
phenomenon
called
the
dream-lag

incorporated
into

decreases
steadily
across
the

for
people
who
report

,
and
it
also
appears
to
only
be

of
rem
dreams
.
as
with
most
research
,
the
dream-lag
effect
raises
why
do
we
have
different
kinds
of
dreams
at
different
stages
of
the
dreams
aren



t
all
the
same
.
everyone
is
aware
of
the
difference
between
good
and
bad
dreams
,
but
we
don



t
tend
to
notice
that
some
dreams
are
more
logical
and
structured
while
others
are
more
bizarre
.
some
dreams
aren



t
real
,
while
others
are
fuzzy
and
indistinct
.
some
dreams
are
dreams
occur
in
all
stages
of
sleep
,
but
they
seem
to
become
mentioned
above
,
dreams
contain
disconnected
memory
fragments
:
places
organized
in
a
structured
and
realistic
way
.
the
dreams
that
occur
in
non-rem
sleep
tend
to
be
shorter
but
more
cohesive
than
rem
dreams
,
and
dreams
that
occur
early
in
the
night
often
also
reflect
recent
waking
counterparts
.
conversely
,
rem
dreams
that
occur
late
in
the
night
are
difference
between
early
and
late-night
dreams
.
the
various
elements
of
current
dream
are
strongly
active


but
they
don



t
appear
to
be
in
disjointed
properties
of
late-night
(
early
morning
)
dreams
.

irrespective
of
how
it
happens
,
it
is
clear
that
dreams
not
only
replay

cartesian
dream
skepticism
dream
skepticism
has
traditionally
been
the
most
famous
and
widely
discussed
philosophical
problem
raised
by
dreaming
(
see
williams
1978
;
stroud
1984
)
.
in
the
meditations
,
descartes
uses
dreams
to
motivate
deception
.
by
contrast
,
dreams
suggest
that
even
in
a
seemingly
dream
.

there
are
different
ways
of
construing
the
dream
argument
.
a
strong
reading
is
that
descartes
is
trapped
in
a
lifelong
dream
and
none
of
dreaming
doubt
;
see
newman
2019
)
.
a
weaker
reading
is
that
he
is
just
sometimes
dreaming
but
cannot
rule
out
at
any
given
moment
that

rival
to

is
that

an
important
advantage
is
that

assimilating
dreams
to
commonplace

as

daydreaming

are
diverse

and
dreams
have

another
issue
is
whether

while
it
is
tempting
to
construe
the

world
as
rich
in

there
is
no
more
to

than
meets
the
eye
,
and
many
think
dream

is
exhausted
by
what

the
focus
of

also
related
to
the
question
of
whether

coincides
with
the
rise

that

.
maybe
dreams
were
either
black
and
white
or
colored
all
main
point
is
that
reports
of
colored
dreaming
are
unreliable
and
our
opinions
about
dreams
can
be
mistaken
(
but
see
windt

issue

led

people

if
dream
pain
does
not
feel
like
real
pain
,
there
is
a
fail-safe
way
to
determine
whether
one
is
now
dreaming
:
one
need
only
pinch
oneself
if
our
dreamer
pleases
to
try
,
whether
the

of

glass

feels
different
from

,
this
raises
the
question
why
we
tend
to
describe
dreams
in
the
same
terms
as
waking
perception
.

it
is
just
because
we
all
know
that
dreams
are
throughout
unlike
some
authors
classify
dreams
as
imaginings
while
acknowledging
they
feel

central
to
the
question
of

is
the
status
of
dreams
as

control

they
are
not

the
meaning
of
dreams
philosophical
discussions
of
dreaming
tend
to
focus
on
(

)
dream

and
(

)
questions
about
the
ontology
of
dreaming
,
its
moral
status
,
etc
.
,
that
tend
to
intersect
with

skepticism
.
by
contrast
,
the
main
source
of
interest
in
dreams
outside
of
philosophy
traditionally
has
been
dream
interpretation
and
whether
dreams
are
a

and
the
use
of
prophetic

dreams

,
used
the
term
enhypnion
to
refer
to
dreams
term
oneiron
for
meaningful
and
symbolic
dreams
of
divine
origin
.

the
practice
of
dream
interpretation
was
famously
attacked
by
aristotle
in
on
prophecy
in
sleep
.
he
denied
that
dreams
are
of
divine
origin
,
are
perceptible
in
the
quiet
of

he
also

the
functions
of
dreaming
different
theories
on
the
functions
of
dreaming
have
been
proposed
and
functions
of
sleep
stages
and
the
functions
of
dreaming
.

functions
are
obviously
linked
to
dreaming
.
an
exception
is
studies
have
investigated
the
relationship
between
dream
content
and
2005
)
.
dreams
rarely
involve
episodic
replay
of
waking
memories
(
fosse
novel
,
complex
,
and
dreamlike
images
at
sleep
onset
;
he
proposes
these
microdreams
shed
light
on
the
formation
and
sources
of
more
complex
dreams
.
there
is
also
some
evidence
that
dream
imagery
might
be
prominent
theories
on
the
function
of
dreaming
focus
on
bad
dreams
and
nightmares
.
it
has
long
been
thought
that
dreaming
contributes
to
dreams
of
nightmare
sufferers
or
in
dreams
following
traumatic
high
prevalence
of
negative
emotions
and
threatening
dream
content
,
dreaming
lies
in
the
simulation
of
ancestral
threats
and
the
rehearsal
of
threatening
events
and
avoidance
skills
in
dreams
has
an
adaptive
in
which
social
imagery
in
dreams
supports
social
cognition
,
bonds
,
and
aspects
of
dream
phenomenology
.
according
to
the
vigilance
hypothesis
,
dream
sounds
,
but
also
smells
or
pains
might
distract
attention
from
vigilance
hypothesis
predicts
that
they
only
rarely
occur
in
dreams
thus
can
occur
in
dreams
without
endangering
the
sleeping
subject
.

focusing
on
the
stuff
dreams
are
not
made
of
might
then
be
at
least
as
important
for
understanding
the
function
of
dreaming
as
developing
a
finally
,
even
if
dreaming

general
and
specific
types
of
dream

cognitive
functions
,
it
would
still
be
possible
that

2000
)
.
it
is
also
possible
that
the
function
of
dreams
is
not
knowable
a
particular
problem
for
any
theory
on
the
function
of
dreaming
is
to
explain
why
a
majority
of
dreams
are
forgotten
and
how
dreams
can
enhanced
dream
recall
is
counterproductive
.
another
problem
is
that
dreaming
can
be
lost
selectively
and
independently
of
other
cognitive
dreaming
can
be
avoided
if
we
do
not
assume
that
dreaming
has
a
states
.
this
depends
on
the
broader
taxonomy
of
dreaming
in
relation
to
wakeful
states
.
for
example
,
if
dreaming
is
continuous
with
waking
mind
should
we
expect
dreams
to
have
a
single
function
;
the
functions
of
dreaming
might
be
as
varied
and
complex
as
those
of
consciousness
,
and
questions
about
dreaming
in
different
areas
of
philosophy
such
as
dream
research
can
meaningfully
inform
the
philosophical
discussion
and
has
often
done
so
in
the
past

shiflett
agrees
that
any

to
understand
your

is
best
done
in

because
dreams
show
us

,
it
is

to
do
this

with

who
works
with

members
of

that

what

according
to
shiflett
,
you
struggle
remembering
your

,
tell
yourself
every
night
before
bed
that
you
will
remember
your

they
suggest

keep
practicing

is
like
remembering
where
you
put

not
remembering
if
you
want
to
know
why
you
dreamed
about
someone
specific





when
you
dream
about
someone
,
you
are
having
subjective
and
objective
experiences
of
this
person
,



says
shiflett
.


sometimes
we
dream
about
associations
with
the
person
.



for
them
,
interpreting
the
dream
starts
that



s
being
told
:


dream
interpretation
is
a
practice
in
tuning
in
dream
is
you
,
you
can
try
putting
yourself
back
in
the
dream
as
the
person
you
dreamed
about
.


if
you
dream
of
someone
,
it
means
you



re
plays
in
your
life
and
in
your
dreams
more
broadly
.

connect
with
how
you
felt
during
the
dream
.


did
you
feel
safe
with
this
person
?
did
you
feel
hesitancy
around
this
person
in
the
dream
?

understanding
the
dream



s
message
.

if
you



re
curious
about
the
connections
between
dreaming
and
spirituality



for
some
dream
analysts
,
working
with
dreams
is
simply
a
psychological
practice
based
entirely
on
the
dreamer



s
inner
workings
and
psyche
.
but
in
many
traditions
,
dreamwork
is
a
spiritual
practice
.
for
shiflett
,
it



s
a
bit
of
both
;
they
believe
that
every
aspect
of
a
dream
comes
rituals
to
tune
in
to
the
frequency
,



they
say
.


dreams
can
be
part
of
our
dreams
and
the
spiritual
realm
.
that
can
be
understood
even
from
the
guarani
word
for
dream
,
aetxara



u
.
the
prefix
,
aetxa
,
means


to
see
beyond
this
material
realm/plane
.



dreams
aren



t
just
a
channel
to
the
says
.


and
we
have
a
relation
to
it
in
our
waking
world
and
the
dream
if
you



re
dreaming
about
someone
repeatedly



a
one-off
dream
about
another
person
is
one
thing
.
but
when
it
becomes
repeating
dreams
about
someone
specific
,
takwapu
recommends
first
thinking
about
how
the
person
you



re
dreaming
about
is
related
to
you
thereof
.


if
they



re
repeatedly
coming
to
you
in
dreams
,
that



s
when
discussing
how
that
person
is
represented
in
your
dreams
and
in
or
talk
to
them
about
what



s
happening
in
your
dreams
,
takwapu
says

that
you
guys
are
meant
to
have
,
and
maybe
this
dream
is
going

,
or
also
reach
out
to
that
person
if
it



s
safe
to
do
so
.



shiflett
says
that
our
dreams
often
involve
repeated
themes
and
dreaming
of
others
that
we
might
not
know
the
whole
meaning
of
until
hindsight
,



they
explain
.


notice
how
often
you
might
dream
of
a
certain
person
.
does
this
person
in
your
dream
always
play
the
same
if
you
dream
about
a
stranger



some
of
the
most
confusing
dreams
are
the
ones
in
which
the
subject
is
familiar
with
the
people
that
you



re
dreaming
about



to
not
shiflett
says
that
in
their
practice
,
dreams
about
unfamiliar
people
can
be
related
to
the
jungian
archetypes
found
in
dreams
:
the
self
,
the
was
doing
,
their
role
in
the
dream
,
and
potentially
other
associations
so
does
the
tone
of
the
dream
matter
as
much
as
who
was
in
it
?
takwapu
during
a
dream
without
closely
inspecting
them
.
instead
of
doing
that
,
that
some
dreams
are
good
dreams
or
nightmares
,
that



s
where
shadow
the
feelings
a
dream
brought
up
can
still
be
spiritually
significant
.

practicing
that
discernment
,
and
deepening
your
awareness
of
the
dream
realm
,
can
help
you
develop
a
stronger
sense
of
when
a
dream
has
a

maybe
it



s
reminding
you
to
share
that
dream
with

she
says

a
lot
of
the
time
,
we
believe
when
we
share
our
dreams
with
other
we
didn



t
dream
about
them
directly
.



if
you
dream
about
your
ex





the
most
common
ex
that
we
tend
to
dream
about
is
our
first
love
.
in
fact
,
we



ll
dream
about
that
person
even
50
years
since
we



ve
been
with
showing
up
in
our
dreams
is
that
they
symbolize
what
first
love
feels

about

ex
dreams
are
simply
about
the
past
,
about
what
we



ve
left

about

,
but
they

and
that

with
your
protection
,
your
safety
,
in
both
the
dream
realm
and
the

about

that
in
itself
can
be
an
indicator
of
what
the

maybe
that
means

when
it
comes

so
when
dreaming
of
a
mother
(
or
your
mother
)
we
ourselves
,
a
relationship
,
a
dream
,
etc
.
if
dreaming
about
your
mother
according
to
loewenberg
,
dreams
about
mothers
are
more
common
than
those
about
fathers
.


we
tend
to
dream
about
the
mother
more
than
the
father
figure
.
in
fact
,
on
average
,
we
tend
to
dream
of
our
mothers
or
dream
mean
,
that
all
figures
actually
represent
a
part
of
yourself

the
dreaming
mind
will
show
us
the
different
bits
of
our
personality
in

,
if
you

pay
attention
to
how
she
is
in

is
she
helpful

in

a
reflection
of
how
you
are
seeing
yourself
as

if
you

about

and
so
whatever
is
going

she
adds
that

fourkiller
also

that
literally
!
dreams
are
symbolic
,



loewenberg
out
.
in
a
dream
,
death
represents
something
ending
or
changing
.
so
,
is
if
you
dream
about
someone
who
has
already
died





if
you
dream
of
someone
who
has
died
,
they
will
likely
represent
a
dream
of
them
,
they
could
represent
who
you
were
back
when
you
were
if
you
dream
about
someone
famous





celebrities
are
really
fun
to
dream
about
!
one
of
the
most
common
dreams
of
a
celebrity
is
that
you



re
friends
with
them
and
you



re
fourkiller
says
this
dream
may
actually
be
about
your
own
desire
for
on
the
celebs
who
appear
in
dreams
most
often
:


i
remember
there
was
a
time
when
oprah
was
the
most
dreamt
of
and
clients
are
much
less
likely
to
submit
a
dream
for
interpretation
the
takeaway
:
fourkiller
notes
that
even
the
silly
dream
you
deem
unworthy
of
interpretation
still
has
significance
.


not
every
dream
necessarily
has
a
meaning
,
but
all
dreams
are
important
.
even
if
whether
a
dream
is
worth
interpreting
is
up
to
the
dreamer
themself
,
thoughts
,
and
yes
,
always
,
your
dreams
.



in
general

i
don
'
t
believe
that
dreams
have
any
special
meaning
,
or
anything
.

nevertheless
,
i
find
dreams
interesting
.
i
always
try
to
remember
what
i
dreamt
about
right
after
i
wake
up
,
and
i
even
remember
many
dreams
i
so
,
i
'
ve
noticed
that
my
dreams
kinda
have
a
recurrent
theme
.
even
usually
my
fault
.
lol
.
last
night
i
dreamt
that
there
were
many
kitties
whenever
i
tried
to
hold
one
,
it
would
scape
and
run
away
.
my
dream
making
me
feel
distressed
.
gosh
,
i
have
such
random
dreams
.
-_-
anyway
,
i
really
like
to
hear
about
people
'
s
dreams
.
so
,
do
you
have
a
recurrent
dream
?
what
are
your
dreams
like
?
:
)
sometimes
,
i
have
this
dream
where
there
'
s
this
giant
black
ball
in
other
than
that
,
i
can
'
t
really
remember
any
dreams
i
have
.
however
,
i
can
sometimes
remember
my
daydreams
and
fantasies
i
have
whilst
i
'
m
my
recurring
dreams
are
usually
negative
because
we
have
something
that
for
example
i
had
a
recurring
dream
that
someone
was
chaseing
me
with
a
i
often
dream
about
going
back
to
high
school
or
college
and
doing
always
feel
relieved
when
i
wake
up
and
realize
it
'
s
just
a
dream
.

i
also
tend
to
dream
about
important
things
that
are
going
to
happen
most
of
my
dreams
take
place
in
an
academic
setting
;
it
gets
pretty
i
also
often
dream
about
things
i
'
ve
seen/experienced
lately
.
about
a
i
try
not
to
dream
,
my
subconscious
scares
me
.
tl
;
dr
:
murder
.

although
a
couple
of
nights
ago
,
i
dreamed
i
was
at
a
party
that
was
so
one
interesting
characteristic
of
my
dreams
is
that
i
'
m
always
aware
of
the
geographic
direction
,
even
though
it
'
s
just
a
dream
.
.
.
anyone
else
most
of
my
dreams
relate
to
things
going
on
in
my
life
,
emotions
i
'
m
there
have
been
several
recurring
dreams
i
'
ve
had
in
my
lifetime
.
as
a
kid
,
i
used
to
dream
about
being
alone
in
my
parents
'
car
,
behind
the
could
help
.
.
.
so
i
just
sat
there
,
terrified
.
the
dream
never
actually
dream
between
the
ages
of
about
four
and
eight
or
so
.

the
second
recurring
dream
is
one
that
started
in
my
mid-teens
and
of
restricting
and
being
extremely
underweight
,
i
used
to
dream
at
i
'
d
somehow
have
forgotten
in
the
dream
that
i
had
an
eating
disorder
as
it
sounds
,
those
were
terrifying
dreams
.
i
'
d
get
hysterical
in
them
,
realise
it
had
just
been
a
dream
,
i
'
d
have
to
check
my
body
,
running
my
dreams
now
,
though
usually
they
focus
on
outright
bingeing
on
massive
also
think
dreams
tend
to
represent
things
we
worry
too
much
about
.
.
.

no
wonder
your
eating
disorder
would
be
represented
in
your
dreams
.

i
think
my
dreams
may
represent
my
ocpd
,
somehow
.
like
,
because
of
the
and
obsessed
with
control
,
and
in
my
dreams
it
seems
i
lose
all
i
wish
i
could
dream
of
more
relaxing
stuff
,
like
flying
,
maybe
.
i
'
ve
never
had
a
dream
where
i
was
flying
.
lol
i
often
dream
about
going
back
to
high
school
or
college
and
doing
always
feel
relieved
when
i
wake
up
and
realize
it
'
s
just
a
dream
.

i
have
dreams
like
those
as
well
.
inside
the
dream
i
usually
think
"oh
,
one
interesting
characteristic
of
my
dreams
is
that
i
'
m
always
aware
of
the
geographic
direction
,
even
though
it
'
s
just
a
dream
.
.
.
anyone
else
i
try
not

my
subconscious

i
try
not
to

my
subconscious
scares
me
.
tl
;
dr
:
murder
.

after
that
happens
,
i
feel
remorseful
in
my
dream
state
.
.
.
it
'
s
an
tend
to
dream
when
i
go
to
bed
at
10pm
or
earlier
.
if
it
'
s
not
some
in
my
dreams
.
(
thankfully
not
in
all
of
them
,
but
way
,
way
too
common
i
often
dream
about
going
back
to
high
school
or
college
and
doing
always
feel
relieved
when
i
wake
up
and
realize
it
'
s
just
a
dream
.

my
dream
!
classmates
still
are
just
as
i
knew
them
,
though
-
they
seem
i
never
dream
about
real
places
.
my
dreams
otherwise
follow
the
laws
of
dreams
,
it
'
s
hard
for
me
to
consistently
pick
holes
in
the
reality
of
them
(
tried
to
learn
to
lucid
dream
not
long
ago
)
.
the
actual
plot
can
most
of
my
dreams
vary
wildly
.
but
i
do
have
a
lot
of
dreams
about
sherlock
and
merlin
.
occasionally
i
'
ll
have
dreams
that
i
'
ll
'
wake
up
'
in
and
do
stuff
before
falling
asleep
or
being
knocked
out
in
the
dream
me
and
my
mum
both
have
a
'
dream
reality
'
where
everything
will
seem
the
same
in
our
dreams
but
with
subtle
differences
that
we
don
'
t
notice
time
my
mum
dreamt
she
was
in
london
,
but
in
her
dream
reality
london
sometimes
,
when
i
realise
i
am
dreaming
everything
will
suddenly
fall
suddenly
get
really
angry
with
me
for
realising
that
i
am
dreaming
and
those
dream
people
.
o_o
scary
stuff
.

i
dream
about
myself
.
.
.
.
.
so
i
'
m
always
having
nightmares

to
bed
around
3-4am
,
and
wake
up
whenever
.
i
tend
to
dream
when
i
go
to
i
rarely
dream
at
all
about
experiencing
parts
of
me
falling
off
and
rare
dreams
which
i
am
a
number
of
sexual

:

based
off
the
events
in

dreams

my
dream
!
classmates
still
are
just
as
i
knew
them
,
though
-
they
seem
my
former
classmates
appear
in
my
school
dream
too
,
but
sometimes
i
sometimes
classmates
from
different
stages
mix
together
in
my
dream
,
i
have
a
lot
of
such
dreams
too
,
almost
guaranteed
to
happen
before
a
basically
,
it
'
s
about
lucid
dreaming
in
someone
else
'
s
dream
,
used
for
the
inside
of
someone
'
s
mind
.
(
and
with
another
dream-related
subplot
i
i
barely
ever
dream
,
and
when
i
do
it
normally
means
i
'
m
due
a
bout
of
insomnia
,
so
it
'
s
not
exactly
a
happy
occasion
.
my
dreams
are
weird
dreamed
i
was
a
boy
called
jason
who
had
been
accused
of
murder
,
and
my
dreams
are
usually
all
over
the
place
.
the
best
ones
are
way
,
i
know
i
dream
in
color
.
i
just
wish
i
had
the
artistic
ability
to
take
some
of
the
vistas
i
'
ve
dreamt
of
to
get
them
out
of
my
head
.

that
stuff
was
wild
.
i
never
remembered
what
i
dreamt
but
i
just
know
all
of
my
dreams
are
extremely
vivid
,
which
would
be
fine
if
it
wasn
'
t
the
dreams
i
have
about
tornadoes
are
strange
in
the
fact
that
in
every
dream
i
have
about
them
the
horizon
always
seems
to
bend
away
from
me
.

these
dreams
always
have
a
tendency
to
create
a
bout
of
insomnia
,
because
i
chain
dream
nightmares
,
which
is
not
fun
.
it
'
s
actually
been
then
there
are
the
generally
weird
dreams
,
like
this
one
dream
i
had
type
of
dream
that
i
seem
to
have
semi-annually
these
days
(
outside
of
the
nightmares
)
are
dreams
where
for
some
reason
i
'
m
chain
smoking
.

weird
,
because
i
do
neither
,
and
i
find
these
dreams
to
be
generally
one
awesome
dream
i
had
though
,
i
was
apparently
a
planetary
terrain
to
bed
around
3-4am
,
and
wake
up
whenever
.
i
tend
to
dream
when
i
go
to
i
used
to
frequently
dream
about
another
planet
crashing
into
the
dream
would
take
a
dark
turn
and
this
massive
round
object
would
appear
that
night
i
dreamt
i
was
in
a
deep
green
grassland
that
stretched
as
tranquil
and
mystified
worlds
are
a
regular
theme
for
my
dreams
.
i
have
dreamt
multiple
times
that
i
am
visiting
this
place
which
is
basically
no
one
there
.
i
would
rather
not
wake
up
from
these
dreams

sigmund

famously
described
these
two
aspects
of
dreams
in

seminal
book
"the

"
freud
suggested
that
dreams
were
highly
symbolic
and

meanings

manifest
content
of
dreams

manifest
content
of
a
dream
refers
to
