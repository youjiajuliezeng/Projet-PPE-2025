minutes
after
the
final
whistle
sounded
in
piraeus
,
a
roar
went
up
from
the
tartan
army
packed
into
a
corner
of
stadio
georgios

.

undiluted
euphoria

proper

celebration
of
ben

and
ryan

to

were
loud

was

scotland

a
thrilling
death
in

belarus

impossible

resuscitated
scottish

of
automatic
qualification
for

.

a
win
against
denmark
at
hampden
on
tuesday
night
and
it
'

done
.
an
opportunity
that
looked
like
it
had
been
trampled
underfoot
when
the
dismal
visitors
in
piraeus
fell
three
goals
down
,
was
reborn
thanks
to
belarus
,
the
unlikeliest
of
unlikely
heroes
of
the
night
.

in
the
birthplace
of
western
drama
,
a
classic
night
unfolded
from
around
the
hour-mark
,
in
greece
and
in
copenhagen
,
a
tragicomedy
and
a
mystery
and
a
farce
.

this
wasn

the
ancient
amphitheatre
of
herodium
down
the
road
,
but
it
was
a
sporting
spectacle
all
the
same
,
twisting
and
turning
,
bewildering
and
perplexing
.

while
scotland
were
starting
to
find
themselves
in
piraeus
there
was
a
hell
of
a
production
going
on
in
copenhagen

for

we

before
it
all
started
to
get
trippy
,
scotland
were
losing
3-0
and
denmark
were
winning
1-0
,
a
series
of
results
that
made
scottish
hopes
of

a
dead
duck
.
hampden
would
not

its

showdown

the
play-offs
beckoned

oh

.
luck
had
run
out
.

it
was
bound
to
in

and
then
.
and
then
.

what
madness
was
this
coming
down
the
line
from
the
parken
stadium
in
copenhagen
.
belarus
,
with
a
world
ranking
of

and
now
,
three
minutes
later
,
a
goal
for
ben
gannon-doak
to
make
it
3-1
,
a
just
reward
for
all
of
scotland
'
s
pressure
towards
the
end
of
the
first
half
that
saw
scott
mctominay
'
s
shot
from
distance
come
slapping
back
off
greece
'
s
crossbar
,
that
also
saw
che
adams
miss
from
close-range
just
before
gannon-doak
did
likewise
.

noise
and
hope
for
the
visiting
fans
.
a
draw
in
denmark
meant
that
scotland
could
still
qualify
automatically
with
a
win
against
the
danes
at
hampden
on
tuesday
.
direct
entry

greece
'
s
heart
in
a
bid
to
sicken
them
again
after
sickening
them
at
hampden
earlier
in
the
group
.

in
that
moment
the
greeks
might
have
looked
at
scotland
as
something
from
a
hollywood
b
movie
,
an
evil
creature
in
a
lagoon
,
riddled
with
bullets
,

some
of
the
scotland
players
hung
about
on
the
pitch
to
hear
the
final
score
from
copenhagen
,
a
denmark
winner
was
the
doomsday
,
the
mood
killer
for
tuesday
night
when
the
sides
come
together
.

seconds
went
by
and
then
confirmation
.
a
draw
,
"winner
takes
all
at
hampden
,
"
gushed
andy
robertson
.
rarely
in
football
has
one
man
sounded
so
happy
after
losing
a
game
of
football
that
everyone
thought
they
could
not
afford
to
lose
.

a
gigantic
favour
from
belarus
?
in
the
millions
of
words
said
and
written
in
the
preamble
to
this
game
,
in
all
the
different
scenarios
presented
about
how
it
might
all
pan
out
,
nobody
came
up
with
this
.

nobody
saw
this
twist
in
the
tale
.
a
clairvoyant
wouldn
'
t
have
called
it
.
mystic
meg
on
her
best
day
wouldn
'
t
have
predicted
it
.

lady
luck
leaves
the
building
.
.
.
then
returns
beforehand
,
we
wondered
if
the
luck
that
scotland
enjoyed
in
their
two
previous
games
in
the
group
would
hold
and
for
the
longest
time
it
looked
like
lady
luck
had
left
the
building
,
storming
out
in
an
almighty
strop
.

greece
were
outrageously
dominant
and
led
1-0
.
only
craig
gordon
'
s
excellence
kept
the
score
down
,
but
time
looked
to
be
running
out
for
scotland
.
one
became
two
and
two
became
three
-
and
it
was
a
shambles
.

defensively
,
scotland
were
shocking
.
grant
hanley
and
john
souttar
looked
like
nervous
kittens
,
spooked
by
the
vision
and
accuracy
and
brilliance
of
christos
tzolis
and
the
coruscating
teenager
konstantinos
karetsas
.

scotland
conceded
six
shots
on
target
in
the
opening
45
minutes
,
their
highest
total
in
a
first
half
in
more
than
nine
years
.
they
ceded
space
and
time
to
greece
,
who
had
it
easy
.
ahead
of
tuesday
night
,
scotland
'
s
limp
beginning
isn
'
t
so
much
food
for
thought
for
clarke
,
it
'
s
a
veritable
feast
,
a
banquet
of
things
to
fix
,
in
tactics
,
in
formation
,
in
selection
,
in
psychology
.

belarus
broke
scotland
out
of
jail
.
just
when
you
thought
they
had
drained
the
well
of
good
fortune
they
got
the
biggest
and
most
unpredictable
dollop
of
luck
imaginable
.

and
so
to
clarke
talking
later
.
he
was
asked
if
he
'
d
ever
known
a
night
like
this
one
in
football
.
"plenty
of
them
,
"
he
said
.
we
wouldn
'
t
mind
interrogating
him
further
on
that
one
.
name
them

break

favour
'
-
clarke
he
called
it
a
strange
game
and
posited
the
theory
that
the
2-1
win
against
belarus
last
month
,
when
scotland
were
booed
off
,
was
a
better
three
points
than
people
imagined
.
freakishly
,
he
might
be
right
on
that
.

he
didn
'
t
hide
from
the
fact
that
scotland
were
blessed
by
the
miracle
of
belarus
.
how
could
he
?
but
he
also
said
something
that
has
a
deep
relevance
to
the
endgame
in
this
group
.
"we
have
to
believe
in
ourselves
more
,
"
he
pointed
out
,
before
elaborating
on
scotland
'
s
dominance
late
on
,
the
chances
they
created
,
the
power
and
aggression
they
showed
,
the
quality
they
put
on
the
pitch
that
was
invisible
for
too
long
.

"for
the
last
15-20
minutes
we
put
a
very
good
side
on
the
back
foot
,
we
put
them
to
the
sword
,
"
he
said
.

it
'
s
all
of
those
minutes
that
went
before
that
were
the
problem
.
how
can
a
team
that
finished
so
strongly
look
so
passive
and
so
vulnerable
at
the
start
?
he
doesn
'
t
have
long
to
find
the
answers
,
but
scotland
'
s
world
cup
aspirations
now
depend
on
him
figuring
it
out
.

carlos
costa
would
never
forget
the
summer
day
his
grandmother
took
him
to
the
movies
.
he
was
6
years
old
when
he
first
walked
into
a
dark
theater
to
watch


o
trapalhão
nas
minas
do
rei
salomão
,



a
1977
brazilian
comedy
that
remains
one
of
the
country



s
biggest
box
office
hits
.



when
i
saw
that
giant
screen
,
wow
,
i
was
mesmerized
.
i
thought
:
someday
i



ll
have
a
movie
theater
of
my
own
,



he
said
.


fifty
years
later
,
that
dream
has
come
true
.



in
2022
,
costa
opened
cine
lt3
,
a
35-seat
cinema
in
sao
paulo
.
using
his
savings
and
credit
card
,
he
spent
about
100
,
000
reais
(
$18
,
600
)
to
renovate
an
old
garage
,
buy
vintage
wooden
seats



which
he
found
in
an
old
shuttered
theater
in
the
countryside



and
transform
the
space
into
a
movie
theater
.

the
screening
room
now
occupies
what
was
once
a
studio



a
space
behind
the
garage
of
his
small
company
that
was
left
idle
during
the
pandemic
.

costa
,
who
worked
as
a
tv
producer
,
opened
the
studios
in
2012
and
rents
them
out
for
screening
tests
and
commercials
.
where
cars
once
stood
,
there
are
now
tables
and
chairs
where
moviegoers
can
wait
for
their
sessions
,
along
with
a
small
counter
where
he
sells
popcorn
,
snacks
,
soft
drinks
and
wine
.

there



s
also
a
small
box
office
where
costa
sells
tickets
to
walk-ins
.

to
buy
in
advance
,
customers
must
send
him
a
whatsapp
message
to
reserve
directly
.



the
movie
theater
is
just
me
.
i
project
the
films
,
make
the
popcorn
,
sell
the
tickets
,
everything
.
for
economic
reasons
,
i
can



t
afford
an
employee
,



costa
said
.


but
i
also
think
that



s
part
of
the
charm
.
i
know
the
regulars
by
name
,
and
that



s
what
makes
this
place
different
.



a
tale
of
resistance
cine
lt3
has
established
itself
as
a
small
haven
for
film
lovers
,
slowly
building
a
loyal
neighborhood
community
and
drawing
movie
buffs
with
programming
that
stands
apart
from
the
city



s
multiplexes
.

costa



s
independent
cinema
is
also
part
of
a
resistance
of
venues
surviving
outside
the
mall
circuit
.
according
to
2024
official
data
,
there
were
only
423
screening
rooms
in
small
theaters
like
lt3
across
the
country
.
in
contrast
,
nearly
90%
of
brazil



s
3
,
542
cinema
screens
operate
inside
shopping
malls
.

some
of
the
country



s
most
traditional
stand-alone
cinemas
now
rely
on
corporate
sponsorships
to
stay
open
.
many
others
have
shut
down
and
been
demolished
.
in
sao
paulo
,
where
the
buildings
remain
,
the
former
screening
rooms
have
often
been
repurposed
into
evangelical
churches
or
adult
movie
theaters
.

even
the
venues
that
survived
have
faced
the
threat
of
closure
in
recent
years
.
when
that
happens
,
local
movie
lovers
often
organize
protests



and
in
some
cases
,
they
succeed
.
that
was
the
case
with
cine
belas
artes
,
located
on
one
of
the
city



s
most
iconic
corners
,
at
the
intersection
of
avenida
paulista
.

maria
amélia
marcos
,
a
71-year-old
teacher
,
was
visiting
lt3
for
the
first
time
on
thursday
,
though
she
often
goes
to
other
independent
theaters
around
sao
paulo
.
she
believes
these
venues
are
essential
to
preserving
the
city



s
cultural
memory
.



independent
theaters
are
very
important
because
they
have
a
completely
different
appeal
,



she
said
.
the
film
selection
is
fantastic
.
i
imagine
the
curators
are
very
thoughtful
people
who
want
audiences
to
see
the
kind
of
movies
they
themselves
would
love
to
watch
.



a
man



s
life
dream
costa
curates
the
lineup
himself
,
focusing
on
art-house
titles
from
brazil
and
abroad
.
when
the
associated
press
visited
the
theater
on
thursday
,
the
schedule
included
a
restored
screening
of


paris
,
texas
,



part
of
a
citywide
retrospective
marking
the
80th
birthday
of
german
director
wim
wenders
.

maída
alves
,
63
,
a
regular
at
lt3
,
had
just
left
a
screening
of


paris
,
texas



when
she
spoke
with
the
ap
.
for
her
,
the
venue
holds
deep
emotional
value
.
having
witnessed
collective
spaces
emptying
out
during
the
pandemic
,
she
sees
the
theater
as
a
rare
and
essential
common
ground
.



i
think
costa
does
a
really
great
job
,



she
said
.


i
see
him
selling
tickets
,
making
popcorn
,
cleaning
,
running
the
film
,
answering
the
phone
.
that
fascinates
me
.
it
shows
how
you
have
to
take
initiative
to
pursue
a
dream
,
which
i
imagine
is
his
life



s
dream
.



costa
often
hears
people
question
his
decisions
,
especially
from
a
financial
perspective
.
while
he
admits
the
work
is
challenging
,
he
is
happy
doing
what
he
loves
.
and
he
loves
cinema
,
just
like
toto
,
the
protagonist
of
his
favorite
movie
,


cinema
paradiso
,



whom
he
paid
tribute
to
with
a
painting
on
the
wall
outside
lt3
.

the
character
bonds
with
a
local
cinema
projectionist
and
,
through
that
relationship
,
develops
a
lifelong
devotion
to
movies
.
costa
said
he
sees
his
own
life
in
toto



s
story
and
believes
movies
have
the
power
to
transform
people
.



no
one
leaves
a
movie
theater
the
same
way
they
entered
,



he
said
.

watching
people
come
and
go
from
his
theater
every
day
for
the
past
three
years
,
he
says
he
has
learned
more
about
human
nature
.



for
example
,
i
screen
a
film
,
and
some
people
leave
crying
while
others
don



t
understand
it
at
all
.
i
can
see
the
diversity
of
human
beings
,



he
said
.


what
affects
one
person
emotionally
doesn



t
have
the
same
effect
on
another
.
i
learn
something
new
every
day
.

ap
:
what
was
your
debut
like
?

donnelly
:
it
was
really
surreal
.
i
feel
like
i



ve
been
working
towards
this
since
i
was
a
little
girl
.
when
i
was
younger
,
broadway
was
the
only
option
.
i
was
a
full
theater
kid



that



s
all
i
wanted
to
do
.
and
,
you
know
,
life
just
took
me
in
different
directions
.
but
this
is
something
that
i
feel
i
was
born
to
do
and
just
being
on
stage
last
night
,
it
kind
of
all
just
makes
sense
.

ap
:
you



re
in
the
al
hirschfeld
theatre
.
do
you
think
you
ever
saw
a
show
there
before
?

donnelly
:
i
definitely
do
.
i
saw


kinky
boots



twice
.
i
love


kinky
boots
.



and
i
think
i
saw


kiss
me
kate



there
,
too
.

ap
:
what



s
your
favorite
musical
?

donnelly
:
my
favorite
musical
of
all
time
is


rent
.



i
saw
it
a
lot
when
i
was
younger



maybe
when
i
was
too
young



and
my
dream
role
has
always
been
mimi
,
which
is
really
funny
.
so
when
i
was
like
5
or
6
auditioning
for
theater
,
they
would
be
like
,


what



s
your
dream
role
?



and
everyone
would
be
,
like
,


annie



or


matilda



and
i



d
be
like
,


mimi
!



they



d
be
like
,


oh
my
god
,
this
kid
!



so
,
it
is
very
full
circle
because


moulin
rouge



is
based
on
the
same
opera
as


rent
.



satine
is
kind
of
mimi
.

ap
:
so
much
of
your
career
makes
this
a
natural
step
.
you
played
a
young
woman
who
sang
in
a
school
production
of


little
shop
of
horrors



on


american
housewife



and
everything
about
the


zombie



franchise
screams
musical
theater
.
how
do
you
describe
your
path
here
?

donnelly
:
there



s
not
a
right
or
wrong
path
.
you
know
,
there



s
so
many
things
in
my
career
where
i



m
like
,


oh
,
i
wish
i



d
done
that



or


maybe
i
should
have
gone
that
way
.



i



m
a
very
chronic
over-thinker
.

but
it
really
doesn



t
matter
.
i
will
say
,
being
a
part
of
disney
definitely
changed
my
life
.

another
broadway-adjacent
step
was
when
you
were
in
the
cast
of
nbc



s
live
telecast
of


the
sound
of
music



in
2013
.
you
were
the
understudy
for
louisa
von
trapp
,
right
?

donnelly
:
yes
,
i
understudied
louisa
and
ella
watts-gorman
,
who
played
louisa
,
was
so
talented
and
amazing
.
i
was
praying
that
nothing
happened
to
her
.
we
weren



t
really
taught
much
.
we
knew
the
music
,
but
that
was
pretty
much
it
,
so
i
was
like
,


dear
god
,
please
,
let
everything
go
ok
.



ap
:
audra
mcdonald
starred
in
that
,
right
?

donnelly
:
oh
my
god
.
listening
to
her
sing
on
set
was
one
of
the
best
gifts
i



ve
ever
been
given
.

ap
:
what
about
your
own
music
?

donnelly
:
that
is
something
that
i
really
want
to
pursue
.
i
feel
like
writing
my
own
music
is
just
so
therapeutic
for
me
,
and
i
love
performing
on
stage
.
having
to
do
a
new
show
every
single
night
and
making
everything
different
and
feeding
off
the
energy
of
the
different
crowd



that



s
what
i
want
to
do
with
my
own
music
as
well
.

ap
:
you
did
theater
growing
up
alongside
helen
j
.
shen
,
who
created
her
part
in


maybe
happy
ending
,



right
?
would
you
also
like
to
originate
a
role
one
day
?

donnelly
:
that
was
such
a
cool
thing
to
watch
her
go
through
and
it



s
so
personal
,
something
that
she
built
with
them
.
that
would
be
really
,
really
cool
.
just
to
have
that
connection
to
it
as
well
.
so
,
yeah
,
originating
would
be
really
like
that
would
great
.

i
live
in
shenandoah
county
,
virginia
.
i



m
a
factory
worker
.
a
farmer
.

a
father
of
two
girls
,
one
still
in
diapers
.
i
get
up
before
the
sun
,
and
most
days
i
don



t
sit
down
until
after
it



s
gone
.

my
partner
hannah
and
i
raise
our
girls
on
a
small
farm
in
the
valley
.

she
works
full-time
too-though
nobody
calls
it
that
.
she



s
a
caregiver
,
a
homemaker
,
a
livestock
handler
,
and
a
mother
.
she
doesn



t
get
a
paycheck
.
she
doesn



t
get
a
break
.
she
doesn



t
get
counted
.

we



ve
relied
on
a
cistern
for
water
for
over
three
years
.
i



m
trying
to
save
up
to
dig
a
well
before
it
runs
dry
.
we
heat
with
firewood
i
cut
myself
.
we
raise
animals
for
milk
,
eggs
,
and
meat
because
the
grocery
bill
outpaces
my
paycheck
.

we



ve
stayed
unmarried


not
because
we
don



t
love
each
other
,
but
because
getting
married
would
kick
my
partner
and
our
daughters
off
the
medicaid
that
keeps
them
healthy
.

my
employer
offers
insurance
,
sure


but
only
if
i
pay
nearly
as
much
as
our
mortgage
.
i
can



t
,
so
we
stay
as
we
are
;
in
love
but
locked
out
.

fuel
the
future
of
independent
rural
reporting
.

we
'
re
dedicated
to
keeping
our
reporting
and
newsletters
free
.
but
we
need
your
help
.

i



m
not
ashamed
of
our
life
.
it



s
honest
work
,
and
it



s
full
of
love
.

however
,
i
am
ashamed
that
in
a
country
as
wealthy
as
ours
,
people
like
us
are
left
out
in
the
cold
.

when
the
so-called


big
beautiful
bill



passed
,
it
was
marketed
as
a
win
for
working
americans
.
from
where
i
stand
,
it
looks
like
the
opposite
.
cuts
to
medicaid
,
reduced
support
for
struggling
families
,
and
a
ballooning
deficit
that
somehow
still
leaves
us
more
exposed
than
before
.

you
can
dress
it
up
however
you
want
,
but
if
it
leaves
working
families
behind
,
it



s
not
serving
the
people
.

this
bill
,
like
so
many
before
it
,
rewards
the
already
powerful
while
punishing
the
people
who
hold
up
the
economy
in
invisible
ways
.
it
gives
to
those
who
lobby
and
takes
from
those
who
labor
.
it
reinforces
a
message
i



ve
felt
in
my
bones
for
years
:
you



re
on
your
own
.

stay
informed
.
get
the
latest
from
the
daily
yonder
directly
in
your
inbox
,

week

not

i



m
writing
this
as
a
man
watching
families
like
mine
wear
themselves
thin
;
working
hard
,
doing
the
right
things
,
and
still
falling
behind
.

this
isn



t
about
red
or
blue
.
it



s
about
the
fact
that
we



re
being
divided
against
each
other
while
both
sides
forget
that
real
americans
bleed
the
same
when
the
cost
of
insulin
triples
or
the
cost
of
groceries
goes
up
again
.

you
shouldn



t
be
able
to
carry
a
hundred
dollars



worth
of
groceries
in
two
hands
.
but
these
days
,
you
can-and
that



s
not
just
wrong
,
it



s
dangerous
.

i



m
writing
to
ask
one
simple
thing
:
who
is
this
country
really
for
?

because
if
it



s
not
for
parents
doing
their
best
to
raise
good
kids
in
a
broken
system



if
it



s
not
for
factory
workers
and
farmers
who
show
up
every
day
,
no
matter
how
little
is
left
in
the
tank



if
it



s
not
for
families
trying
to
make
a
life
from
the
land
and
a
paycheck



then
maybe
the
flag
doesn

wave

all

us

all

i
don

i

i

i
want
a
revolution
of
responsibility-one
where
we
take
care
of
each
other
,
where
people
can
raise
a
family
without
choosing
between
groceries
and
medicine
,
and
where
love
doesn

take

so

you

we

many
parents
only
dream
of
sharing
their
passion
with
their
child
.
but
one
father
recently
had
an
opportunity
to
make
that
dream
a
reality
.

michael
varnum
,
a
psychology
professor
at
arizona
state
university
,
and
his
9-year-old
daughter
,
clara
varnum
,
co-authored
a
scientific
study
that
links
personality
traits
and
other
individual
differences
to
the
frequency
of
lucid
dreams
.

lucid
dreaming
is
the
state
of
consciously
realizing
you
are
dreaming
while
still
inside
of
the
dream
.
the
study
offers
insights
into
what
makes
some
people
more
likely
to
have
these
unusual
dream
experiences
.

"there
'
s
not
a
whole
lot
of
scientific
work
out
there
on
lucid
dreams
,
nor
dreams
more
generally
,
compared
to
other
topics
that
modern
psychologists
tend
to
study
,



varnum
said
.


dreams
are
inherently
fascinating
to
most
of
us
,
and
lucid
dreams
especially
.
but
we
know
very
little
about
them
.
clara
and
i
realized
we
had
some
new
questions
we
wanted
to
ask
about
them
.



the
study
ran
in


dreaming
,



a
scientific
journal
published
by
the
american
psychological
association
.

eye-opening
findings
our
fascination
with
dreams
goes
back
to
ancient
times
when
philosophers
such
as
plato
thought
they
represented
a
challenging
puzzle
about
the
nature
of
reality
.
neurologist
sigmund
freud
believed
they
were
windows
into
our
deepest
fears
and
desires
.

in
psychological
studies
of
dreams
,
called
oneirology
,
researchers
focus
on
how
dreams
relate
to
brain
function
,
especially
memory
and
mental
health
.
unlike
dream
interpretation
,
which
looks
for
meaning
,
scientific
dream
research
studies
how
dreaming
works
using
measurable
data
.



we
sought
to
explore
the
relationship
of
a
wide
range
of
individual
differences
and
the
propensity
to
experience
lucid
dreams
,



wrote
varnum
in
the
study
.


we
attempted
to
replicate
prior
associations
with
openness
,
nightmare
frequency
and
how
often
people
experience
lucid
dreams
.



the
researchers
explored
the
link
between
lucid
dream
frequency
and
variables
such
as
the
need
for
cognition
,
vividness
of
waking
visual
imagery
and
scholastic
aptitude
.

according
to
the
duo
'
s
research
,
people
who
had
a
more
open
attitude
along
with
a
cognitive
curiosity
were
more
likely
to
have
lucid
dreams
.



big
personality
traits
,
people
who
are
more
open
to
new
experiences
and
people
who
are
more
outgoing
reported
having
more
frequent
lucid
dreams
,



varnum
said
.

the
pair
discovered
that
people
who
have
the
ability
to
create
more
vivid
visual
imagery
in
their
minds
when
they
are
awake


also
have
more
lucid
dreams
as
well
as
more
unusual
dreams



dreams
where
the
person
visits
the
same
fictitious
place
or
has
dream
friends
that
don
'
t
exist
in
real
life
,
that
kind
of
stuff
.



and
they
found
that
it
is
not
always


sweet
dreams



for
lucid
dreamers
.



this
is
something
that
was
observed
in
prior
studies
as
well
,
that
people
who
report
more
nightmares
also
have
more
lucid
dreams
,



varnum
said
.

that
made
sense
for
clara
,
who
gave
a
nod
to
all
of
those
experiences
.



people
with
openness
are
.
.
.
generally
more
trusting
.
i
find
that
i
'
m
quite
trusting
and



honest
,



said
clara
,
who
attended
asu
'
s
child
study
lab
in
preschool
and
is
currently
enrolled
at
the
knox
gifted
academy
.


and
also
,
it
'
s
rare
that
i
have
a
dream
that
i
remember
not
being
a
nightmare
.
and
they
'
re
very
intense
nightmares
.



when
it
came
to
scholastic
aptitude
,
they
found
that
people
with
high
grades
on
tests
such
as
the
sat
or
act
are
actually
less
likely
to
experience
lucid
dreams
.
people
who
were
considered


emotionally
stable



were
also
less
likely
to
experience
lucid
dreams
.
no
gender
factor
was
found
in
the
study
.

the
dream
team
the
idea
for
a
lucid
dream
study
sprung
from
an
ordinary
conversation
between
varnum
and
his
daughter
while
they
were
driving
in
the
car



and
it
evolved
from
there
.



we
talk
a
lot
about
ideas
,



varnum
said
.


she
has
a
scientist
for
a
parent
and
that
'
s
something
i
love
to
do
and
something
she
finds
interesting
.
we
were
talking
about
a
dream
she
'
d
had



a
lucid
dream



and
how
we
,
and
probably
lots
of
other
folks
,
have
dreams
where
we
sometimes
become
aware
that
we
'
re
asleep
.
and
we
were
speculating
a
little
bit
about
what
'
s
behind
that
and
whether
some
people
are
more
likely
to
have
them
than
others
.



and
then
she
came
to
my
lab
every
day
with
me
,
and
i
walked
her
through
the
whole
process
,
from
hypothesis
to
generation
,



he
said
.

varnum
sees
this
research
as
a
steppingstone
toward
more
scientific
studies
in
this
area
.
dreams
have
always
intrigued
people
,
but
lucid
dreams
have
been
gaining
significant
scientific
attention
in
recent
years
.



i
think
it
seems
to
be
entering
the
zeitgeist
more
,



he
said
.


so
it
seems
like



at
least
among
part
of
the
scientific
community



that
there
is
a
greater
interest
as
well
.



he
hopes
his
experience
will
also
serve
as
encouragement
or
perhaps
even
a
wake-up
call
for
other
scientists
with
children
.



i
hope
this
inspires
other
scientists
to
take
their
kids
a
little
more
seriously
in
their
curiosity
,



he
said
.


and
just
because
you
'
re
9
years
old
doesn
'
t
mean
you
can
'
t
co-author
a
scientific
paper
.
it
doesn
'
t
mean
you
can
'
t
be
part
of
pretty
much
every
step
of
the
process
.



this
is
how
we
train
future
scientists
,
right
?
and
even
if
we
'
re
not
training
future
scientists
,
we
'
re
helping
people
to
actually
understand
the
process
.
"
varnum
was
the
lead
for
data
curation
on
the
study
,
responsible
for
formal
analysis
,
investigation
,
methodology
,
project
administration
,
writing
,
reviewing
and
editing
.
clara
served
in
a
supporting
role
for
investigation
,
methodology
,
writing
,
reviewing
and
editing
.

this
is
the
fifth
grader



s
first
academic
publication
,
and
she
said
that
coauthoring
the
study
helped
her
learn
more
about
lucid
dreams
as
they
relate
to
her
personal
experience
.



i
never
really
thought
about
them
as
a
thing
that
some
people
just
don
'
t
really
have
,



she
said
.

and
though
clara
says
she
aspires
to
become
a
fashion
designer
when
she
grows
up
,
she
also
enjoyed
the
scientific
process
.



i
'
d
really
like
to
do
this
sort
of
thing
in
science
again

dream
psychologist
a
dream
is
just
a
dream
until
you
put
it
into
action
the
word
dream
has
two
meanings
in
our
language
.
dreams
can
mean
the
nightly
phenomena
that
we
all
create
and
can
also
be
our
greatest
life
ambitions
.
although
these
two
meanings
seem
quite
different
,
they
are
fundamentally
connected
by
a
deeper
level
of
self-awareness
.
by
exploring
your
dreams
and
becoming
more
aware
of
what
they
mean
,
you
naturally
connect
with
practical
ways
to
consistently
fulfil
your
deepest
aspirations
.

ian
is

of
the
dream
connection
process
,
a
uniquely
powerful
method
that
enables
anyone
to
connect
the
imagery
and
symbolism
that
they
create
in
their
dreams
to
opportunities
in
waking
life
where
they
can
use
this
insight
to
make
a
healthy
difference
.

about
dreams
about
dreams
your
dreams
reflect
the
fundamental
patterns
of
your
waking
life
and
,
although
your
nightly
dreams
and
your
daily
life
may
seem
to
have
no
connection
,
the
word


dream



also
means
your
waking
hopes
and
aspirations
,
as
well
as
your
night-time
adventures
.
even
though
the
intentional
pursuit
of
your
waking
dreams
and
the
natural
creation
of
your
nocturnal
dreams
may
seem
to
be
entirely
separate
,
they
are
both
primarily
driven
by
a
deeper
level
of
self-awareness
that
we
all
possess
.
this
more
elemental
understanding
of
yourself
is
a
natural
human
quality
and
is
known
as
your
unconscious
awareness
.

about
psychology
about
psychology
when
exploring
dreams
,
it
can
be
all
too
easy
to
become
fixated
on
the
dream
and
find
yourself
ignoring
the
dreamer
who
is
creating
all
the
dreams
.
to
really
understand
the
meanings
and
messages
from
the
dreams
,
it
is
incredibly
helpful
to
have
an
understanding
of
the
dreamer
and
their
potential
behaviour
patterns
.
psychology
is
the
study
of
human
behaviour
and
goes
beyond
the
purely
conscious
and
physical
manifestations
of
what
it
means
to
be
human
.
although
psychological
studies
can
be
complex
explorations
with
many
apparent
contradictions
,
the
basics
of
psychology
are
who
you
are
,
what
you
need
and
what
you
believe
.

'
t

dreams

,
you

dreams
don



t
just
happen
to
you
,
you
actually
happen
to
your
dreams
.

you
create
everything
in
your
dreams
.
every
person
you
encounter
,
every
place
you
go
,
every
event
you
experience
is
generated
by
your
unconscious
self
.
by
understanding
why
you
create
your
unique
dream
content
,
you
invariably
achieve
a
profound
understanding
of
who
you
really
are
,
what
you
really
need
,
and
what
you
really
believe
.

this
is
also
true
for
your
dreams
in
waking
life
.
your
greatest
ambitions
and
deepest
aspirations
don



t
just
happen
to
you



you
have
to
actively
create
them
.
by
using
the
unconscious
understanding
you
create
every
night
in
your
dreams
,
you
can
connect
far
more
deeply
and
successfully
with
your
lifetime
ambitions
and
aspirations

of

is
generated
from
encountering
conflicts

at

with

,
it

that
our

for
a

of

,
the

we
create
in

are
not
those

it

nekem
ilyenkor
mindig

eszembe
szokott
jutni
a
teljes
sztori
a
tollasbálról

sőt
van
,
hogy
tudom
,
ezt
már
nem
először
álmodtam

merthogy
visszatérő
álmai
szinte
mindenkinek
vannak
,
ezek
jelentése
pedig
sok
esetben
homály

bújjuk

álmoskönyveket

de
őszintén
megmondom
,
én
azokban
még
nem
találtam
magyarázatot

álmaimra

lucid

my

how
do
i
recognize
a
lucid
dream
?
we
all
have
the
power
to
dream
.
but
the
first
step
to
experiencing
a
lucid
dream
is
recognising
that
you
are
in
fact
dreaming
.
it



s
not
as
easy
as
it
sounds
and
not
quite
as
simple
as
employing
the
traditional
pinch
.
it
may
sound
a
little
unusual
,
but
just
like
when
we
are
exploring
any
intriguing
situation
,
we
do
this
by
looking
out
for
clues
.
we
can
identify
these
clues
that
we
can
create
in
our
dreams
by
being
on
the
look-out
for
anything
that
appears
strange
or
out
of
context
.
and
to
help
us
,
we
can
use
a
powerful
connection
process
to
recognise
them
and
work
with
them
.
we



ll
start
with
actually
identifying
the
clue
.

i
dispel
some

and
misconceptions
about

willoughby

holly
was
hugely
relieved
to
realise
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
bad
dream
and
she
was
also
intrigued
to
find
that
she
shares
her
most
common
recurring
dream
with
her
on-screen
husband
,
phillip
schofield
.
the
recurring
dream
is
shared
by
holly
and
phillip
is
the
16th
most
common

(

)
.
today
,
science
is
beginning
to
unpack
what
really
happens
in
the
brain
while
we
sleep


and
why
dreams
might
serve
a
deeper
purpose
than
we
once
thought
.

in
this
article
,
we



ll
explore
the
science
behind
dreaming
:
how
dreams
are
formed
in
the
brain
,
what
rem
sleep
really
does
,
and
why
you
often
can



t
remember
a
single
thing
by
morning
.

how
do
dreams
work
?

dreaming
has
fascinated
humans
for
centuries
.
when
you
look
at
ancient
civilizations
,
they
believed
dreams
were
prophecies
or
divine
messages
(
2
)
,
and
freud
later
proposed
they
revealed
repressed
desires
(
2
)
.

while
the
exact
purpose
of
dreaming
remains
unclear
,
modern
science
has
shifted
the
conversation
from
symbolism
to
brain
function
,
offering
new
insights
into
what
happens
when
we
sleep
(
3
)
.

rem
sleep
rem
sleep
,
known
as
the
stage
where
dreams
are
most
vivid


activates
areas
like
the
amygdala
,
hippocampus
,
and
visual
cortex
,
while
deactivating
the
prefrontal
cortex
,
which
explains
why
dreams
often
feel
illogical
(
3
)
.
these
neural
patterns
support
theories
that
dreams
help
process
emotions
,
consolidate
memory
,
and
simulate
real-life
scenarios
.
rem
sleep
also
supports
neuroplasticity
,
as
it
can
strengthen
and
organize
neural
connections
tied
to
learning
and
memory
.

to
activate
rem
sleep
,
one
needs
to
get
sufficient
sleep
,
which
is
7-9
hours
per
night
,
(
4
)
,
and
studies
show
that
rem
periods
lengthen
and
intensify
in
the
final
sleep
cycles
(
5
)
.
rem
sleep
has
been
linked
to
emotional
regulation
,
creative
insight
,
and
next-day
problem-solving
(
6
;
3
)
.

alternative
function
of
dreaming
some
researchers
believe
dreams
serve
practical
functions
beyond
storytelling
.
the
threat
simulation
theory
suggests
dreaming
evolved
to
help
us
mentally
rehearse
danger
in
a
safe
,
low-risk
setting
(
15
)
.

others
argue
dreams
act
as
neural
housekeeping
,
clearing
out
irrelevant
memories
to
make
space
for
more
useful
ones
(
16
)
.
while
no
single
theory
has
been
proven
,
most
agree
that
dreaming
reflects
coordinated
brain
activity
tied
to
memory
,
emotion
,
and
adaptation
.

what
part
of
the
brain
controls
dreams
?

dreams
aren



t
driven
by
a
single
control
center


they
emerge
from
a
network
of
brain
regions
working
together
.
research
shows
that
the
default
mode
network
(
dmn
)
,
a
system
linked
to
spontaneous
thought
and
imagination
,
remains
active
during
rem
sleep
and
may
help
construct
the
narrative
flow
of
dreams
(
9
)
.

the
parietal
lobes
,
which
help
the
brain
understand
space
and
where
things
are
,
are
thought
to
support
the
immersive
,
scene-like
quality
of
dreams


like
walking
through
a
room
or
flying
over
a
city
(
10
)
.
the
temporo-parietal
junction
(
tpj
)
,
where
the
temporal
and
parietal
lobes
meet
,
has
been
linked
to
self-awareness
during
dreaming
,
and
may
play
a
key
role
in
lucid
dreaming
,
which
is
when
someone
realizes
they



re
dreaming
while
it



s
happening
(
11
)
.

despite
advances
in
neuroscience
,
there



s
still
no
single
,
proven
theory
that
explains
exactly
why
we
dream
or
how
dreams
are
generated
in
one
definite
way
.
crazy
,
right
?

dreams
&
what



s
happening
in
the
brain
dreaming
is
such
a
fascinating
topic
because
everyone
dreams
(
even
if
you
don



t
remember
them
)
,
but
the
experience
of
dreaming
can
vary
from
person
to
person
.
we
do
know
that
most
dreams
last
about
5-20
minutes
,
and
you
can
have
multiple
dreams
in
a
night
.
the
variability
is
in
the
experience
of
dreaming
,
recollection
,
and
intensity
(
12
)
.

some
people
remember
their
dreams
vividly
,
and
others
do
not
.
some
have
the
same
dream
over
and
over
while
others
rarely
repeat
a
dream
.
some
remember
only
a
handful
of
dreams
in
their
lifetime
but
others
can
recall
dreams
nightly
.
some
are
lucid
dreamers
,
and
most
of
us
are
not
.

others
dream
in
color
,
while
some
dream
in
black
and
white

)

and

up
until
the
advent
of
the
electroencephalogram
(
eeg
)
,
researchers
were
unable
to
access
or
measure
electrical
activity
that
occurs
in
the
brain
during
all
states
of
consciousness
.
it
was
once
assumed
that
the
brain
simply


shut
off



at
night


but
we
now
know
that



s
far
from
true
.

in
fact
there
are
varying
levels
of
brain
activity
that
occur
during
different
stages
of
sleep
.
as
we
cycle
through
different
sleep
stages
,
the
brain
shifts
between
distinct
brainwave
frequencies
like
alpha
,
theta
,
delta
,
and
beta


each
linked
to
different
levels
of
awareness
,
rest
,
and
recovery
.

a
deeper
look
:
dreams
in
rem
you
can
dream
in
any
stage
,
but
most
dreaming
appears
to
occur
during
the
rem
stage
.
during
rem
sleep
,
brain
activity
most
closely
resembles
that
of
a
wakeful
state
(
14
)
.
people
also
tend
to
remember
most
of
their
dreams
in
a
rem
state
,
compared
to
other
states
,
and
after
rem
sleep
,
i
.
e
.
a
restful
,
nourishing
night
of
sleep
,
cognitive
function
improves
.
this
is
something
you
can
measure
with
the
muse
headband
.

interestingly
,
a
study
conducted
by
j
.
allan
hobson
at
the
division
of
sleep
medicine
at
harvard
medical
school
proposed
that


rem
sleep
dreaming
can
be
viewed
as
a
virtual
reality
created
from
our
brain



s
devise
.



in
other
words
,


we
sense
,
we
act
and
we
feel



what
we
dream
(
15
)
.
the
theory
inspired
a
team
of
sleep
engineers
at
mit



s
sleep
&
neurophysiology
lab
to
investigate
if
receiving
sensory
stimuli
while
sleeping
could
shape
our
dreams
.

s
sleep
stages
graph
(
hypnogram
)
above
shows
the
different
stages
of
sleep
of
participants
during
their
session
.

to
do
this
,
they
recorded
a
group
of
participant



s
body
and
brainwave
patterns
while
sleeping
and
computed
their
sleep
stages
and
sleep
scores
using
muse
.
while
asleep
,
participants
underwent
sensory
dream
engineering
techniques
using
dormio
,
the
first
interactive
interface
for
sleep
.
these
techniques
include
;
receiving
a
burst
of
scent
or
placing
a
heated
eye
mask
over
their
eyes
(
16
)
.
so
,
what
did
the
study
uncover
?

1
.
ameliorated
dream
valence



after
introducing
pleasurable
or
familiar
scents
and
temperatures
,
participants
showed
positive
affective
responses
(
17
)
while
dreaming
that
are
associated
with
patterns
of
respiration
,
heart
rate
,
and
muscular
activity
(
particularly
during
rem
sleep
)
,
improved
sleep
quality
,
and
mood
.

2
.
alleviated
nightmares



participants
showed
fewer
biomarkers
associated
with
nightmares
,
such
as
increased
and
elevated
heart
rate
,
increased
eye
movements
,
increased
respiration
rate
,
and
the
interference
of
rem
sleep
.

when
you
dream
,
your
whole
brain
is
active
at
some
level
.
however
,
during
rem
sleep
,
your
prefrontal
cortex
is
less
active
.
this
is
the
part
of
the
brain
that
is
responsible
for
planning
and
logic
.
since
activity
in
the
prefrontal
cortex
is
lower
during
rem
sleep
,
we
often
don



t
recognize
the
strangeness
or
implausibility
of
a
dream
until
we
wake
up
(
2
)
.
this
is
why
your
ability
to
fly
or
the
appearance
of
monsters
seems
so
realistic
until
you
wake
up
from
that
dream
(
or
nightmare
)
.

modern
theories
on
dreams
while
the
science
behind
sleep
and
sleep
tracking
continues
to
evolve
,
some
modern
theories
suggest
that
dreams
may
not
carry
deep
symbolic
meaning
at
all
.
instead
,
they
may
be
the
brain



s
way
of
stitching
together
fragments
of
recent
memories
,
thoughts
,
or
emotional
residue


often
from
the
things
we



ve
been
thinking
about
most
.

still
,
other
researchers
argue
that
dreaming
serves
a
deeper
function


one
that
plays
a
vital
role
in
cognitive
health
and
emotional
resilience
.
as
we
better
understand
the
relationship
between
sleep
and
mental
fitness
,
tools
like
muse
allow
us
to
track
brain
activity
in
real
time
,
revealing
how
quality
sleep
can
impact
focus
,
stress
,
and
recovery
.

here
are
three
leading
theories
on
why
we
dream
:
1
.
memory
consolidation
sleep
is
essential
for
memory
formation
.
without
enough
rest
,
the
brain
struggles
to
retain
and
recall
information
.
some
researchers
believe
that
rem
sleep


and
the
dreaming
that
occurs
during
it


helps
sort
,
store
,
or
even
discard
memories
.
in
this
view
,
dreaming
is
like
a
nightly
cleanup
:
clearing
space
for
more
relevant
information
to
take
hold
(
1
)
.

2
.
evolutionary
purpose
because
dreaming
is
present
in
other
mammals
,
some
believe
it
serves
an
evolutionary
function
.
one
theory
suggests
dreams
allow
us
to
mentally
rehearse
difficult
or
threatening
situations
,
helping
us
become
more
adaptive
in
waking
life
.
others
propose
that
dreaming
supports
problem-solving
in
a
safe
,
altered
state


essentially
a
sandbox
for
the
subconscious
(
2
)
.

3
.
emotional
processing
rem
sleep
may
play
a
vital
role
in
helping
the
brain
regulate
emotions
.

a
study
from
the
sleep
and
neuroimaging
laboratory
at
berkeley
found
that
during
rem
sleep
,
the
limbic
system


which
processes
fear
and
emotion


becomes
highly
active
while
also
working
to
block
negative
emotions
such
as
fear
and
anger
(
18
)
.
this
process
may
help
reset
emotional
sensitivity
,
which
explains
why
people
who
get
less
rem
sleep
(
and
therefore
dream
less
)
often
show
more
difficulty
managing
emotions
in
their
waking
hours
.

so
while
the
exact
purpose
of
dreaming
isn



t
fully
proven
,
the
evidence
suggests
it
may
serve
multiple
roles
across
memory
,
survival
,
and
emotional
balance


all
essential
components
of
mental
fitness
.

even
though
we
may
not
fully
understand
why
we
dream
,
or
how
the
brain
pulls
it
off
so
vividly
,
what
we
do
know
is
this
:
dreams
aren



t
just
stories
we
sleep
through
.
they



re
a
sign
that
the
brain
is
working
,
adapting
,
and
healing
in
the
background
.
and
thanks
to
tools
like
muse
and
digital
sleeping
pills
,
we
don



t
have
to
leave
that
mystery
entirely
in
the
dark
.

frequently
asked
questions
about
dreams
&
the
brain
what
happens
in
the
brain
when
we
dream
?

when
we
dream
,
especially
during
rem
sleep
,
brain
activity
increases
in
regions
like
the
amygdala
(
emotion
)
,
hippocampus
(
memory
)
,
and
visual
cortex
(
imagery
)
,
while
the
prefrontal
cortex
(
logic
)
quiets
down
.
this
combination
allows
dreams
to
be
vivid
,
emotional
,
and
often
surreal
.

what
part
of
the
brain
controls
dreaming
?

dreams
are
shaped
by
a
network
of
brain
regions
,
including
the
default
mode
network
(
dmn
)
,
parietal
lobes
(
spatial
awareness
)
,
and
the
temporo-parietal
junction
(
linked
to
self-awareness
and
lucid
dreaming
)
.
there
is
no
single
"dream
center
.
"
how
long
do
dreams
last
?

most
dreams
last
between
5
to
20
minutes
,
and
you
can
have
several
dreams
throughout
the
night
,
especially
during
longer
rem
sleep
cycles
in
the
second
half
of
your
sleep
.

can
you
control
your
dreams
?

yes


this
is
called
lucid
dreaming
.
it
happens
when
the
dreamer
becomes
aware
they



re
dreaming
and
may
even
influence
the
dream



s
direction
.

lucid
dreaming
is
often
linked
to
activity
in
the
temporo-parietal
junction
(
tpj
)
.

why
don



t
we
remember
our
dreams
?

you



re
more
likely
to
remember
a
dream
if
you
wake
up
during
or
right
after
rem
sleep
.
low
activity
in
the
prefrontal
cortex
during
rem
may
also
limit
the
brain



s
ability
to
encode
dream
content
into
long-term
memory
.

does
dreaming
serve
a
purpose
?

while
still
debated
,
current
research
suggests
dreaming
may
support
emotional
regulation
,
memory
consolidation
,
and
problem-solving
.
some
scientists
also
believe
it
helps
the
brain
"reset"
emotional
responses
after
stressful
experiences
.

why
should
i
henceforth
not
love
my
dreams
and
not
make
their
riddling
images
into
objects
of
my
daily
consideration
?

carl
jung
,
the
red
book
last
weekend
,
i
had
a
dream
that
mystified
me
so
much
that
i
had
to
analyze
it
.

this
article
describes
a
step-by-step
process
in
dream
interpretation
based
on
carl
jung



s
work
.
if
you



ve
ever
wanted
to
understand
your
dreams
,
i
recommend
a
good
book
to
get
you
started
.

but
first
,
i
want
to
tell
you
about
the
dream
.

the
dream
i



m
at
work
in
an
open-concept
office
where
cubicles
are
in
an
assembly
line
formation
.
each
cubicle
shares
a
middle
partition
with
a
mirror-cubicle
on
the
other
side
.
in
this
dream
,
i



m
sitting
on
one
side
,
while
my
co-worker
phillip
is
sitting
opposite
me
on
the
other
side
.



hey
jonah
,
do
you
want
to
sit
beside
me
,
or
do
you
want
to
stay
where
you
are
on
your
side
?



phillip
asks
.

as
i



m
debating
the
pros/cons
of
where
i
should
sit
,
reid
,
my
boss
,
comes
over
and
says
,


jonah
,
can
i
see
you
in
my
office
?



so
,
i
walk
into
his
office
,
and
i
see
a
leather
club
chair
.
as
i
walk
closer
,
i
realize
that
the
chair
is
teeming
with
ants
and
some
sticky
substance
like
honey
or
tree
sap
.
i
couldn



t
tell
which
.



how
am
i
going
to
sit
on
that
?
i
would
have
to
clean
that
off
first
.



i
said
to
myself
.

then
,
i
woke
up
.

i
usually
don



t
remember
my
dreams
,
but
this
one
was
so
vivid
that
i
excitedly
recounted
it
to
my
partner
that
sunday
morning
.
later
in
the
day
,
we
walked
around
the
baltimore
inner
harbor
,
stopped
at
the
newly
opened
whole
foods
at
harbor
east
,
and
decided
to
sit
by
the
water
for
a
bit
.
picking
a
spot
,
i
sat
down
on
a
wood
bench
.
i
looked
down
and
couldn



t
believe
my
eyes
.
ants
.
i
saw
the
ants
from
my
dream
.

where
do
dreams
come
from
?

in
my
research
for
this
article
,
i
was
surprised
that
even
in
the
21st
century
,
the


why



and


how



of
dreams
are
largely
undeveloped
from
the
time
of
sigmund
freud
and
carl
jung
.
of
the
two
,
i
was
attracted
to
carl
jung



s
theory
.
he
considered
dreams
to
be
messages
from
the
unconscious
:


dreams
are
impartial
,
spontaneous
products
of
the
unconscious
psyche
,
outside
the
control
of
the
will
.
they
are
pure
nature
;
they
show
us
the
unvarnished
,
natural
truth
,
and
are
therefore
fitted
,
as
nothing
else
is
,
to
give
us
back
an
attitude
that
accords
with
our
basic
human
nature
when
our
consciousness
has
strayed
too
far
from
its
foundations
and
run
into
an
impasse
.



carl
jung
,
cw

this
is
an
exciting
finding
as
i



m
already
curious
about
synchronicity
and
mythology
.
now
i
can
add
dreams
and
the
unconscious
to
the
mix
of
mysteries
.

if
dreams
are
messages
from
the
unconscious
,
then
what
was
my
unconscious
trying
to
say
?

a
warning
about
dream
analysis
but
before
we
begin
,
a
word
of
caution
.
dream
analysis
engages
the
unconscious
,
and
it
might
bring
up
contents
you
don



t
want
to
face
.

it



s
not
a
game
.
here



s
what
jung
had
to
say
about
it
:
we
are
greatly
mistaken
if
we
think
that
the
unconscious
is
something
harmless
that
could
be
made
into
an
object
of
entertainment
,
a
parlour
game
.
certainly
the
unconscious
is
not
always
and
in
all
circumstances
dangerous
,
but
as
soon
as
a
neurosis
is
present
it
is
a
sign
of
a
special
heaping
up
of
energy
in
the
unconscious
,
like
a
charge
that
may
explode
.
here
caution
is
indicated
.
one
never
knows
what
one
may
be
releasing
when
one
begins
to
analyse
dreams
.
something
deeply
buried
and
invisible
may
thereby
be
set
in
motion
,
very
probably
something
that
would
have
come
to
light
sooner
or
later
anyway


but
again
,
it
might
not
.
it
is
as
if
one
were
digging
an
artesian
well
and
ran
the
risk
of
stumbling
on
a
volcano
.
when
neurotic
symptoms
are
present
one
must
proceed
very
carefully
.

in
other
words
,
please
be
careful
.
stop
if
you
sense
that
something
is
wrong
.
and
if
you
are
still
interested
in
exploring
dream
interpretation
,
why
not
see
a
jungian
analyst
in
your
area
?
that
would
be
a
good
idea
.

step-by-step
process
for
interpreting
dreams
the
steps
below
are
from
a
jungian
psychotherapist
,
robert
johnson
,
who
wrote
inner
work
:
using
dreams
and
active
imagination
for
personal
growth
(
affiliate
link
)
.
i
read
this
book
four
years
ago
but
had
no
interest
in
writing
about
it
until
now
.

1
.
write
the
dream
in
detail
2
.
make
associations
3
.
connect
dream
images
to
what



s
happening
internally
4
.
interpret
the
dream
5
.
do
a
ritual
to
make
the
dream
concrete
step
1
write
the
dream
in
detail
write
your
dream
immediately
after
waking
up
.
otherwise
,
you
will
forget
.
in
the
article
follow
your
bliss
,
i
recommend
keeping
a
journal
.
dreams
would
be
a
great
addition
to
that
journal
.

write
down
all
the
dream
details
even
if
they
appear
unimportant
:
setting
,
people
,
objects
,
dialogue
,
smells
,
sounds
,
color
,
and
your


internal
talk



and
emotions
while
dreaming
the
dream
.

step
2
make
associations
the
next
step
is
to
make
associations
.
think
of
the
dream
image
and
then
write
down
everything
that
comes
to
mind
.
for
example
,
in
my
dream
,
the


work
setting



symbolized
drudgery
,
stress
,
and
competition
.

do
this
for
every
dream
detail
you
wrote
down
in
your
journal
.

don



t
consult
a
dream
dictionary
.
dream
symbols
are
unique
to
you
,
so
there
is
no
sense
in
asking
other
people
or
reading
about
it
.
the
only
exception
is
if
the
dream
contains
archetypal
motifs
common
to
the
human
race
.
these
would
include
characters
like
father
,
mother
,
child
,
wise
old
man
,
hero
,
maiden
,
or
trickster
.
with
archetypes
,
it
doesn



t
matter
whether
you
are
white
,
black
,
or
brown
.
we
come
from
the
same
ground
and
live
and
die
under
the
same
blue
sky
,
so
the
meaning
of
archetypes
will
be
the
same
.

step
3
connect
dream
images
to
what



s
happening
internally
just
like
when
reading
mythology
,
dreams
are
not
meant
to
be
interpreted
literally
.
the
language
of
dreams
and
the
unconscious
is
the
symbolic
image
.
therefore
,
the
unconscious
borrows
images
from
your
external
environment
to
symbolize
things
in
the
dream
.
for
example
,
in
my
dream
,
the
characters
phillip
and
reid
do
not
actually
refer
to
the
real
counterparts
.
each
character
represents
something
else
.
thus
,
dreams
are
usually
about
the
interior
world
rather
than
the
external
one
.

step
4
interpret
the
dream
taking
all
the
things
you
wrote
before
,
interpret
the
dream
.
remember
that
a
dream
is
a
coherent
message
from
the
unconscious
cloaked
in
symbolism
.
when
you
interpret
the
dream
and
arrive
at
an
interpretation
that


clicks



or
makes
you
say


a-ha
,



then
you



re
on
the
right
path
.
a
couple
of
caveats
:
*
your
unconscious
will
not
send
you
a
message
that
you
already
know
or
are
conscious
of
.
thus
the
dream



s
message
should
be
a
surprise
to
you
.

*
if
you
arrive
at
a
dream
interpretation
that
is
self-congratulatory
and
self-inflating
,
then
that
interpretation
is
probably
incorrect
.

*
if
you
arrive
at
an
interpretation
that
blames
others
,
then
that
interpretation
is
also
incorrect
.
dreams
are
about
you
and
not
others
.
remember
that
all
the
characters
in
your
dream
represent
aspects
of
yourself
,
even
if
they
look
like
somebody
you
know
.

step
5
do
a
ritual
to
make
the
dream
concrete
after
interpreting
the
dream
,
honor
it
by
doing
something
physical
(
and
not
just
thinking
about
it
)
.
by
doing
something
physical
,
you
integrate
the
dream
,
which
was
unconscious
,
into
your
conscious
waking
life
.
the
ritual
is
a
way
to
send
the
message
to
your
unconscious
that
you
heard
it
.
write
in
your
journal
,
pray
,
light
a
candle
,
or
make
art
out
of
it
.

the
physical
act
should
not
be
loud
or
expensive
.
the
smaller
and
the
more
intimate
,
the
better
.

my
dream
interpretation
now
,
i



m
going
to
apply
these
steps
to
my
dream
.
i
cover
a
number
of
symbols
from
my
dream
:
the
work
setting
,
the
mirror-cubicle
setup
,
my
co-worker
phillip
,
my
boss
reid
,
the
leather
club
chair
,
the
ants
,
and
honey/tree
sap
.
this
is
a
work
in
progress
,
so
the
final
interpretation
may
change
the
more
i
think
about
the
dream
in
the
coming
days
.

the
symbol
of
work
setting
the
work
setting
confused
me
for
a
long
time
.
i
associated
it
with
my
accounting
job
,
but
i
quit
that
last
october
to
be
a
full-time
artist
.

so
,
why
did
this
dream
show
that
i
was
back
at
my
accounting
job
?
that
didn



t
make
any
sense
to
me
.
then
it
hit
me
:
the
work
setting
was
a
symbol
.
my
unconscious
borrowed
the
image
of
my
former
accounting
job
to
symbolize
my
current
job
as
an
artist
.
once
i
realized
what
the
work
setting
meant
,
some
of
the
other
associations
fell
into
place
.

the
symbol
of
mirror-cubicle
setup
i
wrote
down
many
associations
for
the
mirror-cubicle
setup
but
none
clicked
,
so
i
set
it
aside
and
focused
on
my
co-worker
phillip
.

the
symbol
of
phillip
what
did
phillip
represent
?
after
going
over
many
associations
,
the
following
clicked
.
phillip
is
a
real
person
,
and
a
long
time
ago
as
part
of
a
get-to-know
session
at
a
company
retreat
,
he
shared
with
everyone
that
he
was
related
to
sir
arthur
conan
doyle
,
the
writer
of
sherlock
holmes
.
suddenly
,
the
mirror-cubicle
setup
made
sense
!
phillip
represented
the
writer
side
of
my
psyche
.
phillip
sat
directly
opposite
me
.
what
the
dream
was
really
asking
was
,


hey
jonah
,
do
you
want
to
be
a
writer
,
or
do
you
want
to
stay
where
you
are
on
your
side
?



the
symbol
of
reid
this


writer



interpretation
solidified
when
i
considered
reid
.
reid
is
also
a
very
real
person
,
but
not
my
real
boss
.
reid
callanan
is
the
director
of
the
santa
fe
photographic
workshops
.
i



ve
never
met
reid
,
and
yet
here
he
was
in
my
dream
personifying
photography
.

the
symbol
of
the
leather
club
chair
i
associate
the
leather
club
chair
with
comfort
,
luxury
,
wealth
,
or
a
man-cave
.
the
association
that
resonated
the
most
was
luxury
.
that
luxurious
leather
chair
invited
me
to
sink
into
and
be
enveloped
by
it
.

it
occurred
to
me
that
it
was
like
the
snake
that
appears
in
many
mythologies
around
the
world
.
the
leather
club
chair
was
a
trickster
or
troublemaker
.
this
is
the
only
dream
detail
that
feels
archetypal
.
is
this
the
definitive
interpretation
?
i



m
not
feeling
a
click
or
an
a-ha
yet
,
but
it
feels
very
close
.

the
symbol
of
the
ants
i
tried
many
associations
for
the
ants
and
honey/tree
sap
,
separately
and
together
.
i
was
stumped
on
this
one
.
i
took
a
break
and
walked
outside
.
i
think
i
was
afraid
of
what
i
might
discover
if
i
continued
interpreting
the
dream
.
i
wanted
the
dream
to
have
a
positive
outcome
,
i
have
to
admit
that
.

i
wrote
about
the
associations
in
my
journal
over
a
couple
of
days
after
the
dream
.
in
the
end
,
the
following
strangely
resonated
:
*
the
leather
club
chair
is
in
reid



s
office
and
,
therefore
,
represents
the
photography
world
.

*
the
leather
chair
is
like
the
archetypal
snake
as
temptation
inviting
me
to
sit
down
,
but
*
i
can



t
sit
on
the
chair
because
it
was
overflowing
with
ants
that
bite
.

*
in
addition
,
the
sticky
tree
sap
could
trap
me
like
a
venus
flytrap
,
and
i
would
be
unable
to
get
up
from
the
chair
.

what
does
this
dream
mean
?

taking
all
the
above
into
account
,
i
now
believe
that
this
dream
is
sending
a
message
that
there
is
a
tug-of-war
between
photography
and
writing
in
the
interior
landscape
of
my
unconscious
.
i
was
not
aware
of
this
,
but
i
sense
that
this
conclusion
is
true
.
the
dream
seems
to
be
saying
that
i
should
not
sit
on
the
photography
chair
because
of
the
biting
ants
and
the
sticky
tree
sap
.
i
hesitated
moving
to
the
writer
chair
,
so
that
appears
out
as
well
.
the
dream
is
saying
that
i
have
to
find
my
own
path
:
it



s
not
photography
,
and
it



s
not
writing
.

what
is
interesting
about
the
dream
is
that
it
actually
had
three
chairs
:
the
chair
i
was
sitting
on
at
the
beginning
of
the
dream
,
the
writer
chair
,
and
the
photographer
chair
.
the
question
now
is
,
what
did
the
first
chair
represent
?
i
don



t
know
.
no
other
characters
spoke
during
the
dream
.
i
will
have
to
think
about
it
in
the
coming
days
.

usually
in
dream
interpretation
,
the
unconscious
leaves
a
little
clue
as
to
what
the
solution
is
,
but
it



s
escaping
me
at
the
moment
.

in
the
meantime
,
i
completed
a
ritual
to
acknowledge
this
dream
.
i
created
cyanotype
art
from
it
.

interested
in
analyzing
your
dream
?

i
hope
you
found
this
article
helpful
in
describing
how
to
interpret
a
dream
.
this
article
barely
scratches
the
surface
of
carl
jung
dream
analysis
approach
.
to
know
more

i
highly
recommend

update
:
the
symbol
of
the
third
chair
!

i
had
another
dream
on
august
6
,
2020
,
that
clarified
the
meaning
of
the
third
chair
.

in

sheffield
,
and
started

yorkshire-based

began
when
he

internship
in

and

niall
shamma
,
ceo
of

,
said
:
"growing
up
in
sheffield
and
going
to
a
comprehensive
school
,
i
wasn

t
aware
of
the
opportunities
that
existed
in
the
film

tv
industry
,
and
the
position
i
hold
today
is
very
much
down
to
a
chance
meeting
along
the
way
.

"we
want
to
change
that
and
give
local
people
the
belief
that
this
industry
is
open
to
them
,
and
also
provide
them
with
a
meaningful
opportunity
in
the
sector
.
"
applications
open
in
december
exclusively
to
people
living
in
south

.

mr
alsaroori
added
there
were
more
opportunities
to
get
into
the
industry
than
people
may
realise
.

"there
'
s
so
much
support
now
,
it
may
have
been
a
different
world
a
few
years
ago
,
but
it
'
s
developing
faster
and
faster
,
"
he
said
.

"you
won
'
t
be
able
to
see
that
if
you
let
the
negativity
eat
you
up
,
but
if
you
use
it
as
your
motivator
,
you
'
ll
see
that
there
is
a
chance
and
it
'
s
so
much
closer
than
you
think

"you
don

have
to
go
to
london
,
it
can
happen
right
here

dreams
can
feel
stunningly
real
,
leave
us
shaken
,
and
surprise
us
with
their
surreal
storylines
.
but
do
they
actually
mean
anything
?
sigmund
freud
,
the
famed
neurologist
and
founder
of
modern-day
psychoanalysis
,
had
a
lot
to
say
about
how
we
might
interpret
the
visual
,
emotional
,
and
cognitive
sensations
we
experience
while
asleep
.
he
believed
our
dreams
are
actually
the
disguised
representations
of
our
unconscious
desires
,
thoughts
,
wishes
,
and
motivations
.
it
'
s
a
theory
is
still
very
much
alive
today
.



throughout
history
,
there
has
been
both
fascination
and
debate
about
what
dreams
are
,
what
causes
them
,
what
they
mean
,
and
the
benefit
they
may
carry
,



wellness
astrologer
and
author
of


the
complete
book
of
dreams



stephanie
gailing
explains
.


since
antiquity
,
they
have
maintained
a
very
important
role
in
cultures
across
the
globe
,
revered
for
their
visionary
wisdom
.



the
act
of
trying
to
suss
out
the
possible
meaning
of
dreams
can
be
traced
as
far
back
as
the
ancient
sumerian
civilization
,
when
many
people
used
them
as
prophetic
guides
and
to
help
them
make
important
decisions
.
according
to
gailing
,
it
wasn
'
t
until
the
early
20th
century


and
the
birth
of
modern
psychology


that
dreams
were
seen
as
a
reflection
of
the
subconscious
.
nowadays
,
it
'
s
common
to
interpret
dreams
in
order
to
better
understand
our
overall
well-being
.

thea
gallagher
,
psyd
,
clinical
associate
professor
of
psychiatry
at
nyu
langone
health
,
breaks
down
dreams
,
which
typically
occur
in
the
rapid
eye
movement
(
rem
)
sleep
stage
where
images
or
stories
play
out
in
our
minds
,
into
three
types
:
a
pleasant
dream
with
an
ideal
outcome
,
one
with
a
less
preferred
outcome
(
or
oftentimes
a
bizarre
one
)
,
and
a
nightmare
.
what
these
dreams
mean
is
personal
and
can
vary
;
it
all
depends
on
the
dreamer
.



dreams
can
show
us
things
that
we
are
experiencing
in
waking
life
but
are
not
acknowledged
in
our
conscious
minds
,



explains
gailing
.


either
because
we
don



t
have
space
to
process
them
or
we
don



t
want
to
deal
with
certain
feelings
or
thoughts
.



though
the
interpretation
of
dreams
will
be
different
for
everyone
,
there
are
universal
themes
that
pop
up
and
are
worth
looking
into
if
you
'
re
trying
to
figure
out
what
you
'
re
own
dreams
might
mean
.
consider
this
your
crash
course
in
basic
dream
analysis


or
,
a
handy
little
dream
dictionary
,
just
for
you
.
read
on
for
14
of
the
most
common
types
of
dreams
and
what
they
could
mean
for
you
.

dreams
of
being
pregnant
depending
on
what
is
going
on
in
your
life
,
being
pregnant
in
a
dream
can
mean
totally
different
things
.
gailing
says
it



s
important
to
look
at
the
details
of
your
dream
to
help
flesh
out
the
overall
meaning
.

you



ll
also
want
to
explore
how
you



re
feeling
after
the
dream
;
she
says
your
emotional
reaction
can
provide
insights
into
what
the
dream
might
mean
to
you
personally
.



for
example
,
if
you
have
a
dream
about
being
pregnant
,
and
you
have
been
working
hard
on
a
creative
project
,
the
dream
may
relate
to
this
period
of
creativity
you
are
experiencing
and
how
you
feel
about
it
,



she
explains
.


it



s
always
important
to
take
the
dream
into
context
of
what
is
happening
in
a
person



s
waking
life
.



dreams
of
falling
if
you



re
dreaming
about
being
in
a
free
fall
,
gailing
says
it
could
mean
that
you
feel
out
of
control
and
don



t


have
steady
footing



in
some
aspect
of
your
life
.
on
the
other
end
of
that
spectrum
,
however
,
she
says
that
if
you
find
yourself
falling
in
a
dream
but
then
start
flying
,
it
could
represent
freedom
and
trusting
the
timing
of
your
life
.

dreams
of
being
chased
someone
chasing
you
in
your
dreams
is
another
sign
that
you
might
not
feel
in
control
.
gailing
says
it
could
signify
a
couple
of
different
fears
,
such
as
concern
that
someone
is
out
to
get
you
or
that
you



re
avoiding
certain
responsibilities
.

dreams
of
flying
whether
you



re
dreaming
of
flying
like
a
bird
or
cos-playing
your
favorite
marvel
superhero
,
gailing
says
that
the
vivid
dream
of
flying
symbolizes
freedom
and
a
need
for
adventure
.
however
if
the
dream
turns
into
you
falling
as
you
fly
,
it
could
also
mean
you
feel
ungrounded
.
so
remember
to
try
to
pay
attention
to
what



s
going
on
in
the
dream
and
how
you
feel
.

dreams
of
death
an
obvious
reading
,
gailing
says
,
of
dreaming
about
death
is
that
it
could
signify
your
internal
fear
about
dying
.
but
here



s
another
way
she
says
that
you
can
look
at
it
:
it
could
just
be
giving
you
a
sense
that
a
chapter
or
situation
in
your
life
is
coming
to
an
end


and
that
doesn



t
always
have
to
be
a
bad
thing
.

dreams
of
your
teeth
falling
out
one
of
the
most
common
dreams
people
tend
to
have
is
one
that
involves
teeth
falling
out
.
gailing
says
that
there
are
three
main
dream
interpretations
for
this
.
first
,
it
could
signify
some
sort
of
rebirth
and
transformation
,
as
you



re
releasing
something
old
and
making
space
for
something
new
.
the
other
two
are
more
introspective
and
could
signify
feeling
some
sort
of
loss
of
control
or
internal
concerns
about
how
you
present
in
public
.

dreams
of
being
late
or
missing
a
deadline
these
habits
of
tardiness
showing
up
in
your
dreams
usually
shows
some
sort
of
worry
you
have
internally
.
gailing
says
that
it
could
represent
worrying
about
a
lost
opportunity
or
stress
around
your
relationship
with
time
.
it
could
also
show
that
you



re
overwhelmed
by
being
overcommitted
with
responsibilities
.

dreams
of
being
naked
in
public
have
you
recently
fallen
flat
on
your
face
while
walking
through
a
crowd
?
or
accidentally
liked
an
old
photo
of
an
ex
while
on
a
social
media
(
read
:
stalking
)
deep
dive
?
if
you



re
not
one
to
brush
it
off
and
keep
it
moving
,
those
embarrassed
feelings
may
manifest
in
dreamland
as
you
sleep
.
if
you
find
yourself
dreaming
about
being
naked
in
public
,
gailing
says
it



s
most
likely
connected
to
a
recent
embarrassing
situation
you



ve
found
yourself
in
.

dreams
of
infidelity
the
good
news
:
dreaming
of
infidelity
isn



t
necessarily
a
sign
from
the
universe
that
you



re
with
the
wrong
person
or
that
you



re
tapping
into
some
psychic
ability
to
predict
the
demise
of
your
current
relationship
.
the
bad
news
:
you
might
be
dealing
with
trust
issues
in
general
and
operating
from
a
place
of
fear
.
both
gallagher
and
gailing
say
that
if
you



re
not
feeling
secure
or
have
been
betrayed
in
the
past
,
it



s
normal
to
have
those
subconscious
feelings
of
distrust
creep
up
.
maybe
you



re
having
this
dream
because
a
partner
has
cheated
on
you
in
the
past
or
you



re
scared
something
will
ruin
a
beautiful
current
connection
.
just
remember
,
it



s
important
to
ground
yourself
rather
than
lash
out
over
this
particular
dream
.



relationships
are
one
[thing]
that
can
conjure
up
a
lot
of
uncertainty
because
we
don



t
know


there



s
so
many
things
that
could
happen
in
a
relationship
,



says
gallagher
.


i
think
if
it



s
really
something
that
has
no
evidence
based
in
the
present
,
it



s
about
saying


i
got
to
live
my
life



and
engage
with
this
without
knowing
every
possible
outcome
.



dreams
of
phobias
no
one
wants
to
see
insects
or
any
sort
of
creature
they



re
afraid
of
while
they



re
sleeping
.
so
why
is
your
unconscious
mind
doing
you
dirty
in
your
dreams
?
gailing
says
that
if
you



re
dreaming
of
your
phobias
,
you



re
most
likely
afraid
of
not
having
control
in
some
situation
in
your
life
.


[you



re]
face
to
face
with
something
that
haunts
or
scares
you
,



she
says
.

she
adds
that
certain
animals
and
what
those
animals
are
doing
represent
different
types
of
fears
.
for
example
,
a
rat
could
reflect
that
you



re
hiding
or
shunning
something
.

dreams
of
your
ex
don



t
let
the
tiktok
tarot
cards
fool
you
:
a
dream
about
your
ex
isn



t
their
way
of
manifesting
you
back
into
their
lives
.
so
before
you
undo
all
that
healing
by
breaking
the


no
contact
rule
,



both
gailing
and
thea
want
you
to
take
a
step
back
and
evaluate
your
feelings
surrounding
that
dream
.


were
you
thrilled
,
horrified
,
or
puzzled
that
your
ex
starred
in
your
dream
?
also
,
what



s
your
relationship
with
your
ex
?
do
you
never
want
to
see
them
again
[or]
do
you
pine
for
them
?
do
you
regret
or
feel
shame
that
you
broke
up
?
the
context
is
super
important
here
in
understanding
what
the
dream
is
revealing
,



says
gailing
.

once
you
process
your
feelings
about
the
dream
(
and
your
ex
)
,
you
can
then
determine
whether
or
not
you
'
re
harboring
any
unresolved
emotions
about
the
relationship
.
gallagher
says
it



s
normal
to
think
about
people
in
your
past
who
you



ve
had
a
significant
relationship
with
,
but
it
doesn



t
always
have
to
a
deeper
meaning
about
the
specific
person
.



what
do
you
want
to
do
about
[the
dream]
?



asks
gallagher
.


sometimes
people
struggle
with


i
regret
that
i
broke
up
with
this
person



or


i
feel
sadness
that
they
cheated
on
me
.



[they
also
think]
,


i
just
feel
like
it
was
the
wrong
time
,
wrong
place
,
and
what
could
have
been
.



i
think
processing
those
feelings
is
really
important
with
our
relationships
.



dreams
that
feel
like
a
premonition
better
known
as
precognitive
dreams
,
gailing
says
,


these
are
the
ones
in
which
you
dream
of
an
event
that
has
yet
to
occur
,
only
for
it
to
happen
later
.
some
people
[believe]
that
they
are
able
to
foretell
the
future
through
their
dreams
while
others
don



t
sense
that
their
dreams
are
precognitive
until
after
an
event
that
they
dreamed
about
occurs
.



but
not
every
dream
is
a
precognitive
dream
and
you
shouldn



t
live
in
fear
thinking
you



ve
predicted
your
future
every
time
you
sleep
.

instead
,
she
says
to
just
take
note
of
times
when
your
dreams
come
into
fruition
and


embrace
the
power
of
[your]
intuition
and
ability
to
hone
in
on
subtle
perceptions
of
awareness
,



she
says
.
in
other
words
,
this
is
a
great
way
to


further
develop
this
skill
.



gallagher
agrees
and
says
to
have
fun
with
it
.


it
doesn



t
have
to
be
that
serious
or
deep
,



she
says
.


i
think
[it]
could
be
something
that



s
kind
of
neat
and
fun
.
[it
could]
sometimes
make
us
feel
connected
to
a
greater
sense
of
our
consciousness
.



dreams
of
seeing
a
loved
one
who
has
passed
away
when
gallagher



s
sister
passed
and
visited
her
in
a
dream
,
gallagher
says
she
focused
on
the
fact
that
it
gave
her
a
chance
to
create
another
memory
with
a
person
she
misses
dearly
instead
of
trying
to
figure
out
whether
her
sister
was
sending
her
a
message
from
the
great
beyond
.
this
is
something
she
encourages
others
to
do
as
well
.



sometimes
it
'
s
really
nice
to
have
that
experience
where
you
maybe
connect
with
someone
you
'
ve
lost
in
a
dream
,



she
says
.


it
was
such
a
beautiful
experience
to
have
this
kind
of
dream
with
my
sister
in
it
.



if
you



re
feeling
anxious
or
stressed
after
being
visited
by
a
lost
loved
one
in
your
dreams
,
gallagher
recommends
working
through
those
feelings
with
a
trusted
friend
,
family
member
,
or
therapist
.
it
might
prove
to
be
a
meaningful
moment
of
reflection
and
insight
.


dreams
reflect
things
in
our
lives
that
are
very
much
connected
to
strong
emotions
;
it
'
s
no
surprise
that
sometimes
those
will
show
up
in
our
dreams
,



she
says
.


i
think
that
can
be
a
beautiful
thing
.



dreams
of
your
losing
hair
gailing
says
that
dreams
of
losing
one



s
hair
may
be
linked
to
some
sort
of
worry
you
might
have
.
this
will
be
dependent
on
what



s
going
on
in
your
life
,
but
some
common
meanings
behind
this
include
loss
of
control
,
worrying
about
aging
,
or
worrying
about
your
appearance
.

dreams
of
fires
dreaming
about
fires
has
a
wide
range
of
meanings
.
one
of
the
most
common
interpretations
of
this
type
of
destruction
,
says
gailing
,
is
that
you



re
in
a
situation
where
you
have
no
power
.
it
can
also
represent
feelings
of
great
passion
or
your
anger
towards
something
(
or
someone
)
in
your
life
.
on
the
flipside
,
it
could
mean
some
sort
of
purification
and
clearing
away
of
the
old
.

dreams
of
drowning
according
to
gailing
,
water
oftentimes
symbolizes
emotions
of
feeling
overwhelmed
or
consumed
with
something
.
this
could
mean
too
much
pressure
from
a
situation
,
too
much
work
,
too
much
responsibility
in
something
,
etc
.


basically
whatever
in
your
waking
life
that
you
feel
like
you



re
drowning
in
,



she
says
.

dreams
of
snakes
snakes
in
general
,
says
gailing
,
are
associated
with
some
sort
of
transformation
and
metamorphosis
.
she
goes
on
to
explain
that
if
you
dream
about
a
snake
,
it
may
be
because
you



re
in
a
powerful
time
of
letting
things
go
and
shedding
the
things
you



ve
outgrown
.
while
it
sounds
like
a
good
thing
,
she
says
that
it
can
be
scary
letting
go
of
what
you



ve
known
to
invite
the
unknown
.

other
things
that
the
snake
might
represent
include
a
form
of
healing
(
she
points
out
that
the
modern
symbol
associated
with
medicine
features
two
snakes
and
that
the
symbol
associated
with
the
greek
father
of
medicine
asclepius
is
a
staff
with
a
snake
circling
around
it
)
,
passion
,
or
a
sign
someone
around
you
is
being
deceitful
or
untrustworthy
.

nightmares
while
not
pleasant
,
nightmares
can
clue
you
in
to
any
unresolved
emotional
conflicts
that
you
might
be
carrying
around
.


[they]
shine
a
light
on
what
it
is
you
are
fearful
of
,



says
gailing
.


they
give
us
the
opportunity
to
process
unprocessed
feelings
.



for
the
most
part
,
you
don



t
have
to
be
too
concerned
with
having
a
nightmare
.
but
gallagher
says
that
if
you



re
having
recurring
dreams
of
a
traumatic
event
that
has
happened
to
you
,
you
should
seek
out
professional
help
to
work
through
it
.


it



s
a
clinical
symptom
,



she
explains
.


[a
recurring
nightmare
about
a
traumatic
event]
could
be
indicating
that
you
have
some


unfinished
business



that
you
have
to
process
,
which
is
really
important
in
healing
from
ptsd
.



if
it



s
a
nightmare
that
you



re
scared
will
come
true
,
she
says
it



s
normal
to
feel
a
bit
uneasy
.
but
she
encourages
you
to
speak
with
someone
so
that
the
fears
don
'
t
affect
how
you
live
out
your
personal
life
.

both
gailing
and
gallagher
encourage
those
interested
in
interpreting
their
own
dreams
to
keep
a
dream
journal
;
this
will
help
recall
the
dreams
and
make
sense
of
what
they
might
mean
to
you
in
the
present
moment
.
it
might
just
prove
to
be
emotionally
helpful
,
as
well
.


a
dream
journal
offers
you
a
deeper
level
of
understanding
about
yourself
and/or
the
world
around
you
,



explains
gailing
.


even
if
a
dream
is
full
of
fancy
or
nothing
more
than
a
recounting
of
the
day



s
events


i
think
that
opening
up
to
our
dreams
can
leave
us
in
awe
and
inspire
us
to
feel
more
awe
at
the
complexity
and
mystery
of
life
.



what
is
the
most
common
dream
?

gailing
says
that
she
hasn



t
come
across
a
singular
dream
that
most
people
experience
.
instead
,
she
says
there
are
a
series
of
most
popular
themes
that
have
been
found
amongst
people
across
all
different
cultures
.
those
include
being
chased
,
falling
,
arriving
late
,
death
,
teeth
falling
out
,
flying
,
and
being
naked
in
public
.

what
does
a
recurring
dream
mean
?

it



s
pretty
common
to
have
a
recurring
dream
,
says
gailing
.
this
can
mean
a
number
of
different
things
,
such
as
a
sign
from
our
psyche
that
wants
us
to
pay
attention
to
a
certain
thing
or
an
unresolved
issue
that
calls
for
healing
.
this
might
also
be
a
side
effect
of
post-traumatic
stress
disorder
(
ptsd
)
,
where
she
says
that
recurring
dreams
may
be
the
reliving
of
the
traumatic
experiences
while
one
sleeps
.

when
this
happens
,
she
recommends
journaling
about
it
,
or
seeing
a
therapist
or
dream
interpreter
to
discuss
it
and
see
what
meaning
it
has
.
the
most
important
thing
to
do
is
to
pay
attention
to
it
.


often
by
giving
it
an
audience
,
it
will
bring
the
unconscious
inspiration
to
light
and
from
there
you
can
work
things
through
on
a
conscious
level
,



she
says
.


if
there
is
resolve
,
then
the
dream
may
not
appear
as
frequently
or
may
not
even
appear
again
(
as
its
job
may
be
complete
)
.



why
do
people
dream
?

the
million
dollar
question
that
no
one
has
a
straightforward
answer
to
.
gailing
says
there
are
many
theories
on
why
we
dream
,
such
as
our
subconscious
taking
the
time
to
process
the
things
we
can



t
while
we



re
conscious
or
just
chalking
it
up
to
normal
neurological
processes
that
have
no
real
meaning
behind
them
.
many
cultures
also
believe
that
our
dreams
are
ways
our
spirits
and
ancestors
communicate
with
us
.
but
just
as
the
meaning
of
our
dreams
is
dependent
on
our
experiences
and
feelings
,
why
we
dream
in
the
first
place
might
be
a
personal
answer
that
only
you
can
answer
.
at
least
for
now
.

in
dreams



(
1963
)
cover
amongst
the
green-dappled
malvern
hills
,
where
sunlight
spools
onto
spring
leaves
like
puddles
of
water
in
autumn
,
a
peasant
named
will
is
imagined
to
have
fallen
asleep
on
a
may
day
when
both
the
warmth
and
the
light
induce
dreams
.
sometime
in
the
late
fourteenth-century
(
as
near
as
we
can
tell
between
1370
and
1390
)
,
the
poet
william
langland
wrote
of
a
character
in
piers
plowman
who
shared
his
name
and
happened
to
fall
asleep
.


in
a
summer
season
,



langland
begins
,


when
soft
was
the
sun
,
/i
clothed
myself
in
a
cloak
as
i
shepherd
were



and
went
wide
in
the
world
wonders
to
hear
.



presentism
is
a
critical
vice
,
a
fallacy
of
misreading
yourself
into
a
work
,
supposedly
especially
perilous
if
it



s
one
that



s
nearly
seven
centuries
old
.
hard
not
to
commit
that
sin
sometimes
.


but
on
a
may
morning
,



langland
writes
,
and
i
note
his
words
those
seven
centuries
later
on
a
may
afternoon
,
when
the
sun
is
similarly
soft
,
and
the
inevitable
drowsiness
of
warm
contentment
takes
over
my
own
nodding
head
and
drowsy
eyes
so
that
i
can



t
help
but
see
myself
in
the
opening
stanza
of
piers
plowman
.



a
marvel
befell
me
of
fairy
,
methought
.
/i
was
weary
with
wandering
and
went
me
to
rest/under
a
broad
bank
by
a
brook



s
side
,
/and
as
i
lay
and
leaned
over
and
looked
into
the
water/i
fell
into
a
sleep
for
it
sounded
so
merry
.



good
close
readers
that
we
are
all
supposed
to
be
,
it



s
imperative
that
we
don



t
read
into
the
poem
things
that
aren



t
actually
in
it
,
and
yet
i
can



t
help
but
imagine
what
that
daytime
nocturn
was
like
.
the
soft
gurgle
of
a
creek
through
english
fields
,
the
feeling
of
damp
grass
underneath
dirtied
hands
,
and
of
scratchy
cloak
against
unwashed
skin
;
the
sunlight
tanning
the
backs
of
his
eyelids
;
that
dull
,
corpuscular
red
of
daytime
sleep
,
the
warmth
of
day



s
glow
flushing
his
cheeks
,
and
the
almost
preternatural
quiet
save
for
some
bird
chirping
.
the
sort
of
sleep
you
fall
into
when
you



re
on
a
train
that
rocks
you
to
sleep
in
the
sunlight
of
late
afternoon
.
it
sounds
nice
.

cover
piers
plowman
is
of
a
medieval
poetic
genre
known
as
a
dream
allegory
,
or
even
more
enticingly
as
a
dream
vision
.
most
famous
of
these
is
dante
alighieri



s
the
divine
comedy
,
where
its
central
character
(
who
as
in
piers
plowman
shares
the
poet



s
name
)
discovers
himself
in
a
less
pleasant
wood
than
does
will
,
for
that


when
i
had
journeyed
half
of
our
life



s
way
,
/i
found
myself
within
a
shadowed
forest
,
/for
i
had
lost
the
path
that
does
not
stray
.



the
middle
ages
didn



t
originate
the
dream
vision
,
but
it
was
the
golden
age
of
the
form
,
where
poets
could
express
mystical
truths
in
journeys
that
only
happened
within
heads
resting
upon
rough
,
straw-stuffed
pillows
.

langland



s
century
alone
saw
geoffrey
chaucer



s
parliament
of
fowls
,
john
gower



s
vox
clamantis
,
john
lydgate



s
the
temple
of
glass
,
and
the
anonymously
written
pearl
(
by
the
same
lady
or
gent
who
wrote
sir
gawain
and
the
green
knight
)
.
those
are
only
english
examples
(
or
i
should
say
examples
by
the
english
;
gower
was
writing
in
latin
)
,
for
the
form
was
popular
in
france
and
italy
as
well
.
a
.
c
.
spearing
explains
in
medieval
dream-poetry
that
while
sleeping


we
undergo
experiences
in
which
we
are
freed
from
the
constraints
of
everyday
possibility
,
and
which
we
feel
to
have
some
hidden
significance
,



a
sentiment
which
motivated
the
poetry
of
langland
and
dante
.

dante
famously
claimed
that
his
visions



of
perdition
,
purgatory
,
and
paradise



were
not
dreams
,
and
yet
everything
in
the
divine
comedy
holds
to
the
genre



s
conventions
.
both
langland
and
dante
engage
the
strange
logic
of
the
nocturne
,
the
way
in
which
the
subconscious
seems
to
rearrange
and
illuminate
reality
in
a
manner
that
the
prosaicness
of
overrated
wakefulness
simply
cannot
.
dante
writes
that
the


night
hides
things
from
us
,



but
his
epic
is
itself
proof
that
the
night
can
just
as
often
reveal
things
.
within
the
divine
comedy
dante
is
guided
through
the
nine
circles
of
hell
by
the
roman
poet
virgil
,
from
the
antechamber
of
the
inferno
wherein
dwell
the
righteous
pagans
and
classical
philosophers
,
down
through
the
frozen
environs
of
the
lowest
domain
whereby
lucifer
forever
torments
and
is
tormented
by
that
trinity
of
traitors
composed
of
cassius
,
brutus
,
and
judas
.
along
the
way
dante
is
privy
to
any
number
of
nightmares
,
from
self-disemboweling
prophets
to
lovers
forever
buffeted
around
on
violent
winds
(
bearing
no
similarity
to
a
gentle
malvern
breeze
)
.
in
the
purgatorio
and
paradiso
he
is
spectator
to
far
more
pleasant
scenes
(
though
telling
that
more
people
have
read
inferno
,
as
our
nightmares
are
always
easiest
to
remember
)
,
whereby
he
sees
a
heaven
that



s
the


color
that
paints
the
morning
and
evening
clouds
that
face
the
sun
,



almost
a
description
of
the
peacefulness
of
accidentally
nodding
off
on
an
early
summer
day
.

both
the
divine
comedy
and
piers
plowman
express
verities
accessed
by

even
while
the

depicted
are
seemingly
more
fantastic
(
though
in
piers

will
witness
both
the
fall
of
man
and
the

)
.

the

obviousness
of

what

that

that

we

is
prohibited
,

arid
rules

to
this

for
to

as

arguably
the

of

is
that

you

recall
that
in

novel
the
main
character
of
winston

is
a
minor

in

every
aspect
of

had
dreamed
that

was
walking
through

someone
sitting

whether

remains
bizarre

the
fact
that
we
spend
long
stretches
of

submerging
ourselves
in
bizarre
parallel
dimensions
is
so
odd
that
i
can



t
help
but
wonder
why
we
don



t
talk
about
it
more
(
beyond
painful
conversations
recounting
dreams
)
.
so
strange
is
it
that
we
spend
a
third
of
our
lives
journeying
to
fantastic
realms
where
every
law
of
spatiality
and
temporality
and
every
axiom
of
identity
and
principle
of
logic
is
flouted
,
that
you



d
think
we



d
conduct
ourselves
with
a
bit
more
humility
when
dismissing
that
which
seems
fantastic
in
the
experience
of
those
from
generations
past
who



ve
long
since
gone
to
eternal
sleep
.
which
is
just
to
wonder
that
when
william
langland
dreamt
,
is
it
possible
that
he
dreamt
of
me
?

even
with
our
advancements
in
the
modern
scientific
study
of
the
phenomenon
,
their
mysteriousness
hasn



t
entirely
dissipated
.
if
our
ancestors
saw
in
dreams
portents
and
prophecies
,
then
this
oracular
aspect
was
only
extended
by
sigmund
freud



s
the
interpretation
of
dreams
.
he
who
inaugurated
the
nascent
field
of
psychoanalysis
explained
dreams
as
a
complex
tapestry
of
wish
fulfillment
and
sublimation
,
an
encoded
narrative
that
mapped
onto
the
patient



s
waking
life
and
that
could
be
deciphered
by
the
trained
therapist
.
freud
writes
that
there


exists
a
psychological
technique
by
which
dreams
may
be
interpreted
and
that
upon
the
application
of
this
method
every
dream
will
show
itself
to
be
a
senseful
psychological
structure
which
may
be
introduced
into
an
assignable
place
in
the
psychic
activity
of
the
waking
state
.



not
so
different
from
will
sleeping
in
his
field

the
origin
may
be
different



langland
sees
in
dreams
visions
imparted
from
god
and
freud
finds
their
origin
in
the
holy
unconsciousness
,
but
the
idea
isn



t
dissimilar
.
dreaming
imparts
an
ordered
and
ultimately
comprehensible
message
,
even
though
the
imagery
may
be
cryptic
.

freud
has
been
left
to
us
literary
critics
(
who



ve

grown
tired
of
him
over

has
abandoned
terms
like
id
,
ego
,
and
superego
in
favor
of
neurons
and
biochemistry
,
synapses
and
serotonin
.
for
neurologists
,
dreaming
is
a
function
of
the
prefrontal
cortex
powering
down
during
rem
sleep
,
and
of
the
hippocampus
severing
its
waking
relationship
with
the
neocortex
,
allowing
for
a
bit
of
a
free-for-all
in
the
brain
.
scientists
have
discovered
much
about
how
and
why
dreaming
happens



what
parts
of
the
brain
are
involved
,
what
cycles
of
wakefulness
and
restfulness
a
person
will
experience
,
when
dreaming
evolved
,
and
what
functions
(
if
any
)
it
could
possibly
serve

take
place
in
the
same
recurring
location



a
detailed
,
complex
,
baroque
alternate
version
of
my
hometown
of
pittsburgh
.
this
parallel
universe
pittsburgh
roughly
maps
onto
the
actual
place
,
though
it
appears
much
larger
and
there
are
notable
differences
.
downtown
,
for
example
,
is
a
network
of
towering
,
interconnected
skyscrapers
all
accessible
from
within
one
another
(
there



s
a
good
bookstore
there
)
;
a
portion
of
squirrel
hill
is
given
over
to
a
wild
west
experience
set
.
it



s
not
that
i
have
the
same
dreams
about
this
place
,
it



s
that
the
place
is
the
same
,
regardless
of
what
happens
to
me
in
those
dreams
when
i



m
there
.
so
much
so
that
i
experience
the
uncanny
feeling
of
not
dreaming
,
but
rather
of
sliding
into
some
other
dimension
.
an
eerie
feeling
comes
to
me
from
a
life
closer
then
my
own
breath
,
existing
somewhere
in
the
space
between
atoms
,
and
yet
totally
invisible
to
my
conscious
eye
.

such
is
the
realm
of
seers
and
shamans
,
poets
and
prophets
,
as
well
as
no
doubt
yourself



the
dream
realm
is
accessible
to
everyone
.
as
internal
messages
from
a
universe
hidden
within
,
whereby
the
muse
and
oracle
are
within
your
own
skull
.
long
have
serendipitous
missives
arisen
from
our
slumber
,
even
while
we
debate
their
ultimate
origin
.

in

and

study

:

,
and

during

,
arguing
that

reports
were
often
remarkably
raw
and
unfiltered



vividly
bringing
to
life
the
horrors
of
the
conflict
;
for
others
,
nighttime
was
an
escape
from
the
hard
realities
of
life
and
death
in
wartime
.



every
era
imparts
its
own
images
,
symbols
,
and
themes
into
dreams
,
so
that
collective
analysis
can
tell
us
about
the
concerns
of
any
given
era
.
white
writes
that
during
the
civil
war
people
used
dreams
to
relive


distant
memories
or
horrific
experiences
in
battle
,
longing
for
a
return
to
peace
and
life
as
they
had
known
it
before
the
war
,
kissing
loved
ones
that
had
not
seen
for
years
,
communing
with
the
dead
,
traveling
to
faraway
places
they
wished
they
could
see
in
real
life
,



which
even
if
the
particulars
may
be
different
,
is
not
so
altered
from
our
current
reposes
.
one
of
the
most
famous
of
civil
war
dreamers
was
abraham
lincoln
,
whose
own
morbid
visions
were
in
keeping
with
slumber



s
prophetic
purposes
.
only
days
before
his
assassination
,
lincoln
recounted
to
his
bodyguard
that
he



d
had
an
eerily
realistic
dream
in
which
he
wandered
from
room
to
room
in
the
white
house
.


i
heard
subdued
sobs
,



lincoln
said
,
as


if
a
number
of
people
were
weeping
.



the
president
was
disturbed
by
the
sound
of
mourning
,


so
mysterious
and
so
shocking
,



until
he
arrived
in
the
east
room
.


before
me
was
a
catafalque
,
on
which
rested
a
corpse
wrapped
in
funeral
vestments
,



the
body
inside
being
that
of
lincoln
.
such
dreams
are
significant



as
the
disquieting
quarantine
visions
people
have
had
over
the
past
two
months
can
attest
to
.
we
should
listen



they
have
something
to
tell
us
.

cover
within
literature
dreams
seem
to
always
have
something
to
say
,
a
realm
of
the
fantastic
visited
in
novels
as
diverse
as
l
.
frank
baum



s
wizard
of
oz
,
charles
dickens



a
christmas
carol
,
neil
gaiman



s
sandman
,
and
lewis
carol



s
alice
in
wonderland
.
the
dream
kingdom
is
a
place
where
the
laws
of
physics
are
muted
,
where
logic
and
reason
no
longer
hold
domain
,
and
the
wild
kings
of
absurdity
are
allowed
to
reign
triumphant
.
those
aforementioned
novels
are
ones
in
which
characters
like
dorothy
,
ebenezer
scrooge
,
morpheus
,
and
alice
are
subsumed
into
a
fantastical
dream
realm
,
but
there
are
plenty
of
books
with
more
prosaic
dream
sequences
,
from
mr

i

in

dreams
that

,



writes
brontë
,


they



ve
gone
through
and
through
me
,
like
wine
through
water
,
and
altered
the
color
of
my
mind
.



then
there
is
the
literature
that
emerges
from
dreams
,
the
half-remembered
snippets
and
surreal
plot
lines
,
the
riffs
of
dialogue
and
the
turns
of
phrase
that
are
birthed
from
the
baked
brain
of

.

written
in

similar
drug
haze
until
the
poet
was
interrupted
by
that
damned
person
from
porlock
.

spearing
writes
that


from
the
time
of
the
homeric
poems
down
to
the
modern
novel
,
it
is
surely
true
that
the
scene
of
the
great
bulk
of
western
literature
has
not
been
the
internal
world
of
the
mind
,
in
which
dreams
transact
themselves
,
but
the
outer
,
public
world
of
objective
reality
,



but
this
misses
an
important
point
.
all
novels
actually
occur
in
the
internal
world
of
the
mind
,
no
matter
how
vigorous
their
subjects
may
be
.
i



ll
never
be

to
see

exact
same

that
you

,
nor
will
i
hear
the
exact
timber
of
mr

darcy



s
voice
that
you
imagine
,
in
the
same
way
that
no
photographs
or
drawings
or
paintings
can
be
brought
back
from
the
place
you
go
to
when
you
sleep
.
dreaming
and
reading
are
unified
in
being
activities
of
fully
created
,
totally
self-contained
realities
.
furthermore
,
there
is
a
utopian
freedom
in
this
,
for
that
closed
off
dimension
,
that
pinched
off
universe
which
you
travel
to
in
reveries
nocturnal
or
readerly
is
free
of
the
contagion
of
the
corrupted
outside
world
.
there
are
no
pop-up
ads
in
dreams
,
there
are
no
telemarketers
calling
you
.
even
our
nightmares
are
at
least
our
own
.

here
,
as
in
the
novel
,
the
person
may
be
truly
free
.

dreaming
is
the
substance
of
literature
.
it



s
what
comes
before
,
during
,
and
after
writing
and
reading
,
and
there
can
be
no
fiction
or
poetry
without
it
.
there
is
no
activity
in
waking
life
more
similar
to
dreaming
than
reading
(
and
by
proxy
writing
,
which
is
just
self-directed
reading
)
.
all
necessitate
the
complete
creation
of
a
totally
constructed
universe
constrained
within
your
own
head
and
accessible
only
to
the
individual
.
the
only
difference
between
reading
and
dreaming
is
who
directs
the
story
.
as
in
a
book
as
in
our
slumber
,
the
world
which
is
entered
is
one
that
is
singular
to
the
dreamer/reader
.
what
you
see
when
you
close
your
eyes
is
forever
foreign
to
me
,
as
i
may
never
enter
the
exact
same
story-world
that
you
do
when
you
crack
open
a
novel
.


life
,
what
is
it
but
a
dream
?



carol
astutely
asks
.

we
spend
a
third
of
our
day
in
dream
realms
,
which
is
why
philosophers
and
poets
have
always
rightly
been
preoccupied
with
them
.
dreams
necessarily
make
us
question
that
border
between
waking
and
sleeping
,
truth
and
falsity
,
reality
and
illusion
.
that
is
the
substance
of
storytelling
as
well
,
and
that
shared
aspect
between
literature
and
dreaming
is
just
as
important
as
the
oddity
of
existing
for
a
spell
in
entirely
closed
off
,
totally
self-invented
,
and
completely
free
worlds
.

what
unites
the
illusions
of
dreams
and
our
complete
ownership
of
them
is
subjectivity
,
and
that
is
the
charged
medium
through
which
literature
must
forever
be
conducted
.
alfred
north
whitehead
once
claimed
that
all
of
philosophy
was
mere
footnotes
to
plato



accurate
to
say
that
all
of
philosophy
since
then
has
been
variations
on
the
theme
of
kicking
the
tires
of
reality
and
questioning
whether
this
exact
moment
is
lived
or
dreamt
.

the
pre-socratic
metaphysician
gorgias
was
a
radical
solipsist
who
thought
that
all
the
world
was
the
dream
of
god
and
the
dreamer
was
himself
.
plato
envisioned
our
waking
life
as
but
a
pale
shadow
of
a
greater
world
of
forms
.
rene
descartes
in
meditations
on
first
philosophy
forged
a
methodology
of
radical
doubt
,
whereby
he
imagined
that
a
malicious
demon
could
potentially
deceive
him
into
thinking
that
the


sky
,
the
air
,
the
earth
,
colors
,
shapes
,
sounds
and
all
external
things
are
merely
the
delusions
of
dreams
which
he
has
devised
to
ensnare
my
judgment
.
i
shall
consider
myself
as
not
having
hands
or
eyes
,
or
flesh
,
or
blood
or
senses
,
but
as
falsely
believing
that
i
have
all
these
things
.



so
,
from
the
assumption
that
everything
is
a
dream
,
descartes
tried
to
latch
onto
anything
that
could
be
certain
.

other
than
his
own
mind
,
he
wasn



t
able
to
find
much
.
in
dreams
there
is
the
beginning
of
metaphysics
,
for
nothing
else
compels
us
to
consider
that
the
world
which
we
see
is
not
the
world
which
there
is
,
and
yet
such
philosophical
speculation
need
not
philosophers
,
since
children
engage
in
it
from
the
moment
they
can
first
think
.

when
i
was
a
little
kid
,
i
misunderstood
that
old
nursery
rhyme


row
your
boat
.



when
it
queried
if


life
is
but
a
dream
,



i
took
that
literally
to
mean
that
all
which
we
experience
is
illusion
,
specter
,
artifice
.
in
my
own
abstract
way
i
assumed
that
according
to
the
song
,
all
of
this
which
we
see
:
the
sun
and
moon
,
the
trees
and
flowers
,
our
friends
and
family
,
are
but
a
dream
.
and
i
wondered
what
it
would
be
like
when
i
woke
up
,
who
i
would
recount
that
marvelous
dream
too
?


i
had
the
strangest
dream
last
night
,



i
imagined
telling
faces
unknown
with
names
unconveyed
.
i
assumed
the
song
meant
that
all
of
this
,
for
all
of
us
,
was
a
dream



and
who
is
to
know
what
that
world
might
look
like
when
you
wake
up
?
such
a
theme
is
explored
in
pop
culture
from
the
cyberpunk
dystopia
the
matrix
to
the
sitcom
finale
newhart
,
because
this
sense
of
unreality
,
of
dreams
impinging
on
our
not-quite-real
world
is
hard
to
shake
.
writing
about
a
classic
metaphysical
thought-experiment
known
as
the
omphalos
argument
(
from
the
greek
for


navel
,



as
relating
to
a
question
of
eden
)
,
philosopher
bertrand
russell
wrote
in
the
analysis
of
mind
that


there
is
no
logical
impossibility



that
the
world
sprang
into
being
five
minutes
ago
,
exactly
as
it
then
was
,
with
a
population
that


remembered



a
wholly
unreal
past
.



perhaps
we



ve
just
dozed
off
for
a
few
minutes
then
?

here



s
the
thing
though



even
if
all
of
this
is
a
dream



it
doesn



t
matter
.
because
in
dreams
you



re
innocent
.
in
dreams
you



re
free

theories
upon
reading
a
dream
episode
in
a
novel
by
dickens
,
or
the
brontes
,
or
wilkie
collins
,
we
might
pause
and
ask
,
what
did
the
victorians
consider
dreams
to
be
?
this
simple
question
leads
to
others
:
are
literary
dreams
the
same
as
real
dreams
?
should
we
interpret
them
as
such
?
perhaps
even
,
what
do
we
believe
dreams
to
be
?
if
we
distinguish
real
dreams
from
those
in
novels


that
is
,
in
conventionalized
,
artificial
forms


then
the
interpretation
of
these
literary

presents
certain
problems

cautious

.
we
can
consult
various
psychoanalytic
methodologies
for
interpretive
guidelines
,
and
these
will
often
produce
fascinating
readings
,
yet
we
may
experience
a
certain
intellectual
dissatisfaction
with
interpretations
which
must
be
so
alien
to
what
the
author
and
original
audience
of
a
text
might
have
imagined
the
dream
to
have
meant
.
warnings
against
the
intentional
fallacy
notwithstanding
,
an
author
'
s
apprehensions
of
what
dreams
are
,
how
they
may
be
used
in
literature
,
and
how
readers
will
respond
to
them
clearly
matter
in
the
process
of
composing
a
dream
episode
.
these
considerations
suggest
a
cultural
and
historical
approach
,
rather
than
a
psychanalytic
one
.
perhaps
no
better
test
case
for
this
approach
exists
than
in
the
works
of
charles
dickens
,
so
let
us
ask
,
what
did
dickens
believe
dreams
to
be
?

dickens
composed
a
vast
quantity
of
literary
dreams
throughout
his
career
.
they
appear
in
his
earliest
writings


sketches
by
boz
and
the
pickwick
papers


and
in
his
last
,
unfinished
novel
:
the
mystery
of
edwin
drood
.
in
between
,
they
proliferate
in
dickens
'
s
novels
(
for
example
,
in
david
copperfield
,
bleak
house
,
hard
times
and
great
expectations
)
,
and
create
the
essential
structure
for
shorter
prose
fiction
,
like
a
christmas
carol
and
the
chimes
.
dickens
depicts
dreams
and
dreaming
not
only
in
his
manifestly
fictional
works
,
but
also
in
his
ostensibly
nonfictional
ones
:
examples
include
"an
italian
dream"
in
pictures
from
italy
,
and
"night
walks"
in
the
uncommercial
traveler
.
furthermore
,
he
published
numerous
articles
on
dreams
in
his
magazines
household
words
and
all
the
year
round
,
and
speaks
of
them
in
his
letters
.

this
wealth
of
material
has
received
surprisingly
little
critical
attention
.
catherine
bernard
has
one
of
the
most
focused
discussions
of
dickens
and
victorian
theories
of
dreaming
,
published
in
1981
in
the
collection
victorian
science
and
victorian
values
.
she
posits
dickens
as
a
proto-freudian
,
however
,
claiming
for
example
that
"dickens
anticipated
freud
'
s
idea
of
day
residues
and
the
distinction
between
latent
and
manifest
content"
and
further
that
he
"intuitively
perceived
the
autobiographical
origins
of
dreams"
(
205
)
.
ronald
r
.
thomas
continues
the
interweaving
of
freud
and
dickens
in
his
discussions
of
great
expectations
and
a
christmas
carol
in
dream
s
of
authority
:
freud
and
the
fictions
of
the
unconscious
(
1990
)
.

such
an
approach
is
understandable
.
sigmund
freud
'
s
the
interpretation
of
dreams
(
published
one
hundred
years
ago
)
revolutionized
the
scientific
study
of
dreams
,
and
provided
a
framework
for
the
interpretation
of
these
phenomena
.
we
are
all
familiar
with
freud
'
s
model
of
the
unconscious
and
with
his
theories
of
the
underlying
causes
of
dreams
,
and
so
our
tendency
may
be
to
apply
these
notions
to
the
dreams
we
find
in
novels
written
before
1900
as
well
as
to
those
written
after
.
by
doing
so
we
assume
that
authors
such
as
dickens
somehow
had
a
modern
understanding
of
the
unconscious
and
an
intuitively
freudian
notion
of
dreaming
.
we
also
assume
that
literary
dreams
operate
in
the
same
manner
as
actual
dreams
(
freud
himself
proposes
this
approach
in
"delusions
and
dreams
in
jensen
'
s
gradiva"
)
.

these
assumptions
require
careful
scrutiny
,
however
,
if
literary
dreams
are
not
real
dreams
(
that
is
,
artifacts
of
the
unconscious
)
,
but
consciously
created
imitations
of
them
.
this
paper
argues
that
literary
dreams
arise
from
a
historical
and
cultural
context
,
and
reflect
not
just
their
author
'
s
insights
into
the
human
mind
,
but
also
contemporary
theories
about
dreams
(
from
both
scientific
and
popular
sources
)
,
as
well
as
conventional
literary
representations
of
dreams
and
visions
.
to
attribute
to
dickens
a
modern
understanding
of
the
unconscious
or
an
intuitively
freudian
notion
of
dreaming
is
to
wrench
him
from
his
historical
context
.
to
do
so
is
also
to
ignore
the
complications
of
the
textual
evidence
,
for
dickens
'
s
own
writings
on
dreams
reveal
complex
assumptions
about
the
causes
and
meanings
of
dreams
.
this
complexity
stems
from
the
conflicting
theories
of
dreaming
in
the
victorian
period
.

in
order
to
understand
how
dickens
used
dreams
,
then
,
we
must
return
to
the
question
:
what
would
he
consider
dreams
to
be
?
dickens
grew
up
under
the
dual
influence
of
the
romantic
movement
'
s
fascination
with
states
of
marginal
consciousness
,
and
neuroscience
'
s
new
theories
and
advances
in
the
study
of
the
brain
.
the
change
in
long
accepted
paradigms
of
the
structure
of
the
nervous
system
,
and
the
well-publicized
and
revolutionary
work
in
organology
and
phrenology
of
franz
joseph
gall
and
caspar
spurzheim
,
"all
helped
to
focus
the
attention
of
the
layman
as
well
as
the
scientist
on
the
nervous
system
and
,
in
particular
,
on
the
brain"
(
clarke
and
jacyna
5
)
.
roger
cooter
notes
,
"gall
'
s
doctrine
beckoned
into
its
orbit
every
one
of
the
social
,
psychological
,
intellectual
,
political
and
religious
concerns
that
had
been
aggravated
and
heightened
by
the
conditions
of
rapid
and
pervasive
social
and
economic
change"
(
6
)
.
the
operation
of
the
sleeping
mind
became
an
important
focal
point
for
supporters
and
opponents
of
gall
,
and
this
attention
encouraged
widespread
speculation
on
the
mysterious
nature
and
meaning
of
dreams
.

that
speculation
manifested
itself
in
two
broad
paradigms
:
the
scientific
and
the
spiritual
.
perhaps
the
next
step
to
answering
our
initial
question
,
then
,
is
to
ask
,
"what
would
dickens
have
been
reading
about
dreams
?
"
scientific
studies
,
or
at
least
studies
which
assumed
the
prestige
and
authority
(
if
not
the
pure
methods
)
of
science
,
proliferated
in
the
early
nineteenth
century
.
but
these
studies
coexisted
in
the
book
stalls
and
the
magazines
with
works
of
oneirocriticism
(
or
dream
interpretation
guides
)
and
spiritual
accounts
of
revelatory
dreams
.

the
foundation
for
most
scientific
studies
of
mental
activity
was
associationism
,
which
david
hartley
popularized
in
his
observations
on
man
(
1749
)
.
hartley
deduces
three
causes
for
dreams
:
the
residue
of
daily
impressions
,
the
physical
state
of
the
dreamer
'
s
stomach
and
brain
,
and
,
most
importantly
,
the
associations
of
thoughts
and
images
which
always
go
on
in
the
mind
,
but
which
are
more
vivid
and
less
controlled
during
sleep
.
most
later
scientific
studies
accept
hartley
'
s
associationist
paradigm
;
a
partial
list
of
those
published
during
dicken
'
s
life
includes
william
newnham
'
s
essays
on
superstition
(
1830
)
;
john
abercrombie
'
s
inquiries
concerning
the
intellectual
powers
and
the
investigation
of
truth
(
1831
)
;
walter
c
.
dendy
'
s
on
the
phenomena
of
dreams
and
other
transient
illusions
(
1832
)
;
robert
macnish
'
s
the
philosophy
of
sleep
(
1834
)
;
alexander
grant
'
s
the
literature
and
curiosities
of
dreams
(
1865
)
;
and
william
hammond
'
s
sleep
and
its
derangements
(
1869
)
.
although
these
works
differ
in
terminology
and
emphasis
,
their
similarities
are
striking
.
the
authors
,
all
physicians
or
surgeons
,
employ
little
scientific
rigor
to
support
their
claims
.

more
frequently
,
they
rely
on
second-hand
anecdotal
evidence
,
classical
sources
(
usually
pliny
,
plutarch
and
suetonius
)
or
literature
(
often
sir
walter
scott
'
s
the
antiquary
)
.
we
can
follow
the
trail
of
one
anecdote
as
a
typical
example
:
to
illustrate
how
sensory
impressions
shape
our
dreams
,
abercrombie
describes
how
his
friend
,
james
gregory
,
gave
him
a
manuscript
by
his
father
,
dr
.
gregory
,
which
relates
that
the
doctor
had
gone
to
bed
with
a
hot
water
bottle
at
his
feet
,
and
had
dreamed
he
was
walking
on
mt
.
aetna
(
260
)
.
abercrombie
makes
no
apparent
effort
to
check
this
story
'
s
veracity
or
to
duplicate
it
.

macnish
repeats
the
anecdote
of
dr
.
gregory
'
s
dream
,
and
thirty-seven
years
later
,
hammond
continues
its
use
in
this
fairly
effaced
form
:
"instances
are
given
of
persons
sleeping
with
bottles
of
hot
water
applied
to
their
feet
dreaming
of
walking
on
burning
lava
,
or
some
other
hot
substance"
(
133
)
.
a
scientific
methodology
to
study
whether
the
same
stimulus
will
produce
similar
dreams
did
not
appear
until
alfred
maury
'
s
le
sommeil
et
le
reves
(
1865
)
,
which
pioneered
the
role
of
stimulation
and
suggestion
in
shaping
dreams
.

certain
general
assumptions
about
dreams
recur
in
these
scientific
studies
.
one
often
repeated
point
is
that
dreams
only
occur
in
imperfect
sleep
.
newnham
states
,
"there
are
no
dreams
in
natural
sleep


that
is
,
in
sound
and
quiet
sleep


the
body
being
healthy
,
and
the
mind
at
ease
.
"
dreams
occur
only
in
a
"morbid"
state
,
when
the
brain
is
disordered
by
certain
irritants
,
such
as
strong
emotions
,
prolonged
study
,
approaching
sickness
,
dyspepsia
or
other
states
which
impair
sleeping
(
163
)
.
macnish
employs
a
phrenological
model
,
stating
that
in
"perfect
sleep"
all
the
brain
'
s
organs
are
at
rest
;
but
if
one
or
more
of
the
organs
remain
awake
while
the
others
sleep
,
dreaming
results
(
43
)
.
the
rationale
seems
to
be
that
dreaming
has
to
occur
in
an
aberrant
state
of
mind
,
because
of
the
irrational
nature
of
dreams
.

another
general
feature
of
these
studies
is
the
analogy
between
dreaming
and
insanity
.
abercrombie
compares
how
in
both
dreaming
and
madness
the
mind
acts
without
volition
,
and
follows
whatever
"chain
of
thought"
or
associated
images
are
present
at
the
moment
(
256
)
.
macnish
calls
a
dream
a
"transient
delirium
,
"
which
resembles
insanity
in
the
absence
of
the
mental
faculty
of
judgement
(
45
)
.
all
the
studies
assert
that
dreams
originate
in
both
previous
mental
associations
and
existing
sensory
impressions
.
macnish
speaks
at
greater
length
than
the
others
on
the
effect
of
diet
on
the
content
of
dreams
.
he
contends
that
"a
disordered
state
of
the
stomach
and
liver
will
often
produce
dreams
,
"
and
that
as
a
general
rule
dyspepsia
produces
bad
dreams
(
53
)
.
a
final
and
crucial
point
of
agreement
in
these
various
scientific
studies
is
their
denial
of
prophetic
powers
in
dreams
.
dendy
states
that
although
the
notion
of
revelatory
dreams
is
"entertained
generally
,
"
we
no
longer
live
in
"days
of
special
inspiration"
;
therefore
,
he
cannot
rationally
accept
"the
visions
of
slumbers
as
revelations
or
prognostics"
(
70
)
.
macnish
advances
the
same
argument
,
and
comments
that
the
idea
"is
so
singularly
unphilosophical
,
that
i
would
not
have
noticed
it
,
were
it
not
advocated
even
by
persons
of
good
sense
and
education"
(
102
)
.
this
last
remark
is
important
,
for
it
indicates
that
the
scientific
view
of
dreams
had
strong
competition
for
popular
acceptance
.

we
find
that
competition
in
dream
books
and
spiritual
accounts
of
revelatory
dreams
.
dream
books
,
inexpensive
handbooks
for
the
most
general
and
least
educated
audiences
,
contain
encyclopedic
lists
of
objects
or
actions
,
and
provide
instructions
on
how
to
interpret
any
of
them
if
they
appear
in
the
reader
'
s
dreams
.
these
books
invariably
claim
that
an
understanding
of
dreams
will
help
the
reader
prosper
,
or
will
warn
of
coming
trouble
.
stemming
in
principle
from
the
second-century
dream
book
the
oneirocriticon
(
or
the
interpretation
of
dreams
)
of
artemidorus
(
first
translated
into
english
in
1643
)
,
nineteenth-century
dream
books
are
often
anonymous
works
plagiarized
heavily
from
previous
dream
books
,
sometimes
only
altering
the
title
page
in
hopes
of
attracting
new
buyers
.
one
such
work
i
have
examined
is
the
anonymous
,
undated
nocturnal
revels
:
or
,
universal
interpreter
of
dreams
and
visions
.
this
text
presents
"the
nature
,
causes
,
and
uses
of
various
kinds
of
dreams
and
representations
,
"
and
lists
various
objects
and
actions
in
dreams
,
with
their
meanings
.
another
widely
read
type
of
dream
book
,
more
spiritual
and
less
pragmatic
,
catalogues
narratives
of
revelatory
dreams
and
other
mysterious
phenomena
.
some
of
these
works
insist
on
a
divine
or
supernatural
origin
for
this
capacity
,
while
others
claim
it
is
a
natural
human
power
.
for
example
,
mrs
.
blair
'
s
dreams
and
dreaming
(
1843
)
contains
narratives
of
premonitory
dreams
drawn
from
the
bible
and
contemporary
accounts
,
and
the
author
treats
these
dreams
as
divine
revelations
that
god
offers
as
moral
directives
.
she
asks
,
"does
it
not
savour
of
infidelity
to
say
,
that
the
divine
being
has
neither
the
will
nor
the
ability
to
instruct
his
creatures
asleep
as
well
as
awake
?
"
(
114
)
.
similarly
,
an
anonymous
article
in
the
baptist
magazine
in
1828
asserts
,
"insignificant
as
dreams
in
general
are
,
there
are
doubtless
two
classes
of
agents
that
have
access
to
our
minds
when
sleep
has
impaired
our
own
agency"


those
classes
are
good
angels
(
or
"ministering
spirits"
)
and
evil
angels
(
who
tempt
the
weak
to
wickedness
)
(
qtd
.
in
grant
160-62
)
.
in
contrast
to
such
religious
theories
are
those
who
assert
a
natural
origin
.
thomas
de
quincey
speaks
in
suspiria
de
profundis
(
1845
)
of
"the
machinery
for
dreaming
planted
in
the
human
brain"
as
"a
dreaming
organ"
analogous
to
other
sensory
organs
(
88
)
,
and
"the
one
great
tube
through
which
man
communicates
with
the
shadowy"
(
88
)
.
catherine
crowe
'
s
the
night
side
of
nature
(
1850
)
,
provides
many
anecdotal
examples
of
presentiments
and
prophetic
dreams
,
and
explains
that
"the
soul
,
which
is
designed
as
the
mirror
of
a
superior
spiritual
order
(
to
which
it
belongs
)
,
still
receives
,
in
dreams
,
some
rays
from
above
,
and
enjoys
a
foretaste
of
its
future
condition"
(
47
)
.
yet
crowe
asserts
that
"the
faculty
of
presentiment
[is]
a
natural
one
,
though
only
imperfectly
and
capriciously
developed"
(
47
)
.
some
few
studies
tried
to
link
the
spiritual
and
scientific
theories
.
joseph
haven
,
in
mental
philosophy
:
including
the
intellect
,
sensibilities
,
and
will
(
1857
)
,
tenatively
asserts
,
"a
dream
may
be
prophetic
,
yet
not
supernatural
.
some
law
,
not
fully
known
to
us
,
may
exist
,
by
virtue
of
which
the
nervous
system
,
when
in
a
highly
excited
state
,
becomes
susceptible
of
impressions
not
ordinarily
received
.
.
.
so
as
to
become
strangely
cognizant
of
the
coming
future
.
can
anyone
show
that
this
is
impossible
?
is
it
more
improbable
than
that
the
cases
recorded
are
mere
chance
coincidences
?
"
(
qtd
.
in
grant

)
.

this
survey
of
the
competing
discussions
of
dreams
suggests
the
real
diversity
of
theories
and
explanations
which
coexisted
.
the
two
broad
streams
of
scientific
and
spiritual
dream
theories
,
each
with
subcurrents
of
disputes
over
method
or
essence
,
run
parallel
and
in
continual
debate
throughout
the
nineteenth
century
.
these
debates
mirror
victorian
cultural
tensions
and
uncertainties
;
dreams
become
a
focus
for
discussions
of
the
nature
of
the
mind
and
the
soul
,
matter
and
spirit
,
science
and
religion
.
most
victorians
,
immersed
in
this
debate
,
aware
of
both
channels
of
thought
,
considered
dreams
to
be
meaningless
and
meaningful
,
mere
physiological
artifacts
and
messages
from
the
great
beyond
.

dickens
was
not
only
aware
of
but
also
keenly
interested
in
this
topic
.

george
henry
lewes
reports
that
dreams
were
"a
subject
which
always
interested
him
,
and
on
which
he
had
stored
many
striking
anecdotes"
(
72
)
.
dickens
owned
several
of
the
major
studies
of
dreams
,
including
ones
by
macnish
and
abercrombie
(
bernard
202
)
.
determining
dickens
'
s
actual
view
of
dreams
,
however
,
is
problematic
,
because
his
comments
in
letters
and
essays
often
appear
at
odds
with
his
practice
in
the
novels
.
selecting
representative
examples
from
his
letters
,
essays
and
novels
,
we
can
better
see
the
diversity
of
his
views
.

outside
of
his
fiction
,
dickens
tends
on
the
whole
to
favor
the
scientific
view
over
the
supernatural
.
he
parodies
popular
dreambooks
in
the
essay
"dictionary
dreams
,
"
published
in
all
the
year
round
(
31
august
,
1861
)
,
which
sarcastically
refutes
the
accuracy
of
the
ladies
'
own
dreambook
and
ridicules
popular
oneirocriticism
(
549-552
)
.
for
instance
,
the
narrator
of
the
essay
reads
that
"to
dream
of
cucumbers
denotes
recovery
to
the
sick
,
and
you
will
fall
speedily
in
love
;
.
.
.

also
moderate
success
in
trade
.
"
the
narrator
,
a
believer
in
modern
associationist
theories
,
sarcastically
conjectures
whether
it
would
not
be
possible
to
cultivate
such
an
auspicious
dream
by
contemplating
and
then
devouring
an
enormous
cucumber
before
bedtime
(
551
)
.

dickens
also
tends
to
explore
the
workings
of
the
sleeping
mind
as
macnish
and
abercrombie
do
,
emphasizing
the
chaotic
whirl
of
thoughts
freed
from
the
control
of
waking
reason
.
in
"early
coaches
,
"
which
appears
in
sketches
by
boz
(
1836
)
,
he
depicts
the
fitful
sleep
of
a
man
awaiting
a
predawn
call
to
wake
him
for
a
business
trip
.
in
this
passage
he
exhibits
a
classic
scientific
paradigm
of
dreams-caused
by
imperfect
sleep
,
shaped
by
associated
thoughts
and
external
auditory
sensations
,
and
perceived
half-incredulously
by
the
half-conscious
mind
:
you
left
strict
orders
,
overnight
,
to
be
called
at
half-past
four
,
and
you
have
done
nothing
all
night
but
doze
for
five
minutes
at
a
time
,
and
start
up
suddenly
from
a
terrific
dream
of
a
large
church-clock
with
the
small
hand
running
round
,
with
astonishing
rapidity
,
to
every
figure
on
the
dial-plate
.
at
last
,
completely
exhausted
,
you
fall
gradually
into
a
refreshing
sleep


your
thoughts
grow
confused


the
stage-coaches
,
which
have
been
'
going
off
'
before
your
eyes
all
night
,
become
less
and
less
distinct
,
until
they
go
off
altogether
;
one
moment
you
are
driving
with
all
the
skill
and
smartness
of
an
experienced
whip


the
next
.
.
.
you
are
closely
muffled
up
,
inside
,
and
have
just
recognised
in
the
person
of
the
guard
an
old
schoolfellow
,
whose
funeral
,
even
in
your
dream
,
you
remember
to
have
attended
eighteen
years
ago
.
at
last
you
fall
into
a
state
of
complete
oblivion
,
from
which
you
are
aroused
,
as
if
into
a
new
state
of
existence
,
by
a
singular
illusion
.
you
are
apprenticed
to
a
trunk-maker
;
how
,
or
why
,
or
when
,
or
wherefore
,
you
don
'
t
take
the
trouble
to
inquire
;
but
there
you
are
,
pasting
the
lining
in
the
lid
of
a
portmanteau
.
confound
that
other
apprentice
in
the
back
shop
,
how
he
is
hammering
!

,

what
an
industrious
fellow
he

you
have
heard
him
at

for
half
an
hour
past
,
and
he
has
been
hammering
incessantly
the
whole
time
.

,

,

,

he

s
that
he
said
?

you
make
a
violent
exertion
,
and
start
up
in
bed
.

this
passage
seems
well
informed
by
scientific
studies
:
the
dreams
occur
only
before
and
after
the
period
of
sound
sleep
(
or
"oblivion"
)
,
not
during
it
;
the
perception
of
time
is
warped
during
the
dream
,
so
that
a
brief
moment
of
dreaming
seems
to
contain
an
immense
span
of
time
;
and
the
mind
creates
a
dream
to
explain
the
sounds
perceived
during
sleep
.
the
second-person
narration
of
this
dream
emphasizes
its
familiarity
;
this
is
the
sort
of
dream
,
dickens
suggests
,
that
anyone
would
have
under
these
conditions-even
the
reader
.

dickens
interpreted
his
own
dreams
from
this
scientific
standpoint
as
well
.
in
a
letter
to
john
forster
in
september
of
1844
,
he
describes
a
vivid
dream
he
had
while
in
italy
with
his
family
:
the
spirit
of
mary
hogarth
appears
to
him
,
veiled
in
blue
like
the
madonna
but
nevertheless
recognizable
.
he
pleads
for
a
sign
that
the
visit
is
real
,
asking
for
the
comfort
of
her
mother
,
and
also
for
the
answer
to
the
question
,
"what
is
the
true
religion
?
"
dickens
relates
,
as
it
paused
without
replying
,
i
said


good
god
,
in
such
an
agony
of
haste
,
lest
it
should
go
away
!



'
you
think
,
as
i
do
,
that
the
form
of
religion
does
not
so
greatly
matter
,
if
we
try
to
do
good
?


or
,
'
i
said
,
observing
that
it
still
hesitated
,
and
was
moved
with
the
greatest
compassion
for
me
,
'
perhaps
the
roman
catholic
is
the
best
?
'
.
.
.
.
'
for
you
,
'
said
the
spirit
,
full
of
such
heavenly
tenderness
for
me
,
that
i
felt
as
if
my
heart
would
break
;
'
for
you
,
it
is
the
best
!
'
then
i
awoke
,
with
the
tears
running
down
my
face
.
(
4
.
196
)
this
experience
would
seem
to
epitomize
a
revelatory
vision
:
the
spirit
of
a
woman
he
idolized
comes
to
him
from
the
other
world
and
answers
one
of
the
profound
questions
of
his
life
.
yet
rather
than
musing
on
any
serious
significance
in
the
dream
(
or
converting
to
catholicism
)
,
dickens
instead
explains
it
away
.
he
speculates
on
"the
fragments
of
reality
.
.
.
which
helped
to
make
it
up
,
"
including
a
painful
recurrence
of
rheumatism
which
upset
his
sleep
,
the
near
drowning
of
his
son
fred
the
week
before
which
directed
his
thoughts
toward
death
,
the
presence
in
the
room
of
an
altar
with
a
missing
religious
picture
(
which
had
caused
dickens
to
wonder
what
the
face
in
the
picture
had
looked
like
)
,
and
the
nearby
convent
bells
which
had
supplied
the
"thought
,
no
doubt
,
of
roman
catholic
services"
(
4
.
196
)
.
this
letter
suggests
dickens
was
not
only
familiar
with
the
standard
scientific
explanations
of
dreams
,
but
tended
to
accept
them
and
apply
them
to
his
own
dreams
.

dreams
were
a
recurring
topic
in
his
magazines
,
suggesting
that
the
topic
interested
a
general
audience
.
dickens
'
published
the
essays
"dreams"
in
household
words
(
8
march
1851
)
,
and
"a
physician
'
s
dreams
,
"
in
two
parts
in
all
the
year
round
(
26
november
and
3
december
1859
)
.

both
tend
to
reflect
the
accepted
scientific
explanations
of
the
causes
,
types
and
meaning
of
dreams
.
the
household
words
essayis
more
interesting
because
it
provided
dickens
with
an
opportunity
to
discuss
his
observations
on
the
topic
.
in
a
letter
he
instructed
dr
.
thomas
stone
,
the
author
,
to
revise
the
article
,
stating
,
"if
i
venture
to
say
i
think
it
may
be
made
a
little
more
original
,
and
a
little
less
recapitulative
of
the
usual
stories
in
the
books
,
it
is
because
i
have
read
something
on
the
subject
,
and
have
long
observed
it
with
the
greatest
attention
and
interest"
(
letters

:

)
.
dickens
'
s
views
,
while
informed
by
scientific
explanations
and
literary
conventions
of
dreams
,
accept
neither
fully
.
in
contrast
to
most
scientific
views
of
the
day
,
dickens
opposes
the
idea
that
a
residue
of
the
day
'
s
events
chiefly
makes
up
our
nightly
dreams
:
"i
would
suggest
that
the
influence
of
the
day
'
s
occurrences
,
and
of
recent
events
,
is
by
no
means
so
great
(
generally
speaking
)
as
is
usually
supposed
.
.
.
.
when
dreams
can
be
directly
traced
to
any
incidents
of
recent
occurrence
,
it
appears
to
me
that
the
incidents
are
usually
of
the
most
insignificant
character-such
as
made
no
impression
,
of
which
we
were
conscious
,
at
the
time"
(
6
.
276-277
)
.
his
own
dreams
,
he
states
,
are
more
often
scenes
from
his
youth
,
and
he
marvels
that
although
he
had
been
married
fourteen
years
and
had
nine
children
,
he
never
dreamed
of
them
.
he
argues
that
his
experience
is
more
common
than
not
,
based
on
many
conversations
on
the
subject
.
he
also
asserts
that
there
is
"a
remarkable
sameness"
in
our
dreams
,
which
are
not
,
as
stone
supposed
,
"very
various
and
different"
(
6
.
278
)
.
he
adds
,
how
many
dreams
are
common
to
us
all
,
from
the
queen
to
the
costermonger
!
we
all
fall
off
that
tower-we
all
skim
above
the
ground
at
a
great
pace
and
can
'
t
keep
on
it



.
.
.
we
all
take
unheard-of
trouble
to
go
to
the
theatre
and
never
get
in


or
to
go
to
a
feast
,
which
can
'
t
be
eaten
or
drunk-or
to
read
letters
,
or
placards
,
or
books
,
that
no
study
will
render
legible


or
to
break
some
thraldom
or
other
,
from
which
we
can
'
t
escape


or
we
all
confound
the
living
with
the
dead
,
and
all
frequently
have
a
knowledge
or
suspicion
that
we
are
doing
it


we
all
astonish
ourselves
by
telling
ourselves
,
in
a
dialogue
with
ourselves
,
the
most
astonishing
and
terrific
secrets


we
all
go
to
public
places
in
our
night
dresses
,
and
are
horribly
disconcerted
,
lest
the
company
should
discern
it
.
(

.
278-279
)
stone
'
s
article
makes
use
of
dickens
'
suggestions-even
to
the
extent
of
paraphrasing
and
quoting
his
examples
.

besides
establishing
dickens
'
fascination
with
and
expertise
in
the
study
of
dreams
,
the
letter
also
provides
two
interesting
statements
about
his
theory
of
dreams
in
literature
.
one
suggests
that
dreams
can
contain
a
hidden
but
discernible
meaning
:
"i
should
say
the
chances
were
a
thousand
to
one
against
anybody
'
s
dreaming
of
the
subject
closely
occupying
the
waking
mind


except


and
this
i
wish
particularly
to
suggest
to
you


in
a
sort
of
allegorical
manner"
(
276
)
.
he
also
discusses
the
use
of
dreams
as
a
plot
device
:
"the
obvious
convenience
and
effect
of
making
the
dreams
of
heroes
and
heroines
bear
on
the
great
themes
of
a
story
as
illustrated
by
their
late
experiences
,
seem
to
me
to
have
led
the
poets
away
from
the
truth
,
on
this
head-and
to
have
established
the
conventional
beliefs
from
which
i
differ"
(
277
)
.

he
may
have
discounted
the
conventions
,
but
he
also
found
them
too
convenient
and
effective
not
to
use
in
his
own
novels
.

there
is
a
tension
between
what
dickens
in
his
letters
asserts
real
dreams
are
,
and
what
he
creates
in
his
fiction
to
represent
a
dream
.

that
tension
between
scientific
and
supernatural
poles
varies
in
different
episodes
from
different
novels
.
we
might
plot
a
line
,
with
the
fever
dreams
which
arise
as
recognizable
medical
symptoms
in
bleak
house
and
great
expectations
on
one
end
,
and
the
overtly
supernatural
dream
visions
in
a
christmas
carol
and
the
chimes
on
the
other
;
in
between
we
might
place
revelatory
dreams
which
exist
in
a
more
or
less
psychologically
believable
milieu
:
montague
tigg
'
s
nightmare
in
martin
chuzzlewit
,
or
stephen
blackpool
'
s
vision
in
hard
times
.
such
an
organizing
principle
helps
to
suggest
the
variety
of
dickens
'
literary
dreams
.
despite
the
useful
metaphor
of
a
line
between
two
opposite
points
,
though
,
even
the
scientifically
explicable
fever
dreams
contain
true
revelations
,
and
even
the
supernatural
visions
are
accompanied
by
rational
dismissals
within
the
text
.
both
paradigms
coexist
in
the
dream
episode
.
dickens
takes
pains
to
construct
around
his
dream
episodes
a
rational
frame
which
explains
it
away
as
originating
within
the
dreamer
.
in
martin
chuzzlewit
,
for
instance
,
montague
tigg
has
a
nightmare
of
a
door
that
he
cannot
keep
closed
,
and
of
a
dangerous
man
named
j
.
his
dream
may
be
a
result
of
his
waking
thoughts
and
restless
mind
(
tigg
worries
about
the
door
in
his
room
he
cannot
lock
,
and
"his
fears
or
evil
conscience
reproduced
this
door
in
all
his
dreams"
(
651
)
)
,
or
imperfect
slumber
(
tigg
sleeps
in
a
strange
bed
,
during
a
thunderstorm
)
,
or
dim
awareness
of
external
sensations
(
tigg
wakes
to
find
jonas
chuzzlewit
"standing
at
his
bedside
watching
him
.
and
that
very
door
wide
open"
(
651
)
)
.
other
common
explanations
are
incipient
illness
(
esther
summerson
'
s
smallpox
)
or
indigestion
(
as
scrooge
exclaims
to
marley
'
s
ghost
,
"you
may
be
an
undigested
bit
of
beef
,
a
blot
of
mustard
,
a
crumb
of
cheese
,
a
fragment
of
an
underdone
potato
.

there
'
s
more
of
gravy
than
of
grave
about
you
,
whatever
you
are
!
"
(
12
)
)
.

the
dream
itself
,
however
,
follows
the
(
conventionally
literary
)
tradition
that
dreams
are
true
revelations
.
tigg
'
s
own
ghost
appears
in
the
dream
as
"a
man
with
a
bloody
smear
upon
his
head"
to
reveal
his
fate
:
jonas
will
kill
him
with
a
blow
to
the
head
five
chapters
later
.

the
tension
between
a
suspicion
of
and
a
faith
in
the
revelatory
power
of
dreams
is
,
of
course
,
quite
ancient
,
but
the
ambivalence
continues
throughout
the
nineteenth
century
and
directly
shapes
dickens
'
s
discussion
of
and
attitude
toward
dreams
.
further
exploration
of
how
popular
theories
of
dreams


which
exist
on
the
smudged
boundaries
of
science
,
religion
and
folklore-influenced
dickens
'
s
creation
of
literary
dreams
would
form
an
important
contribution
to
the
study
of
his
works
.
in
her
essay
"against
tradition
:
the
case
for
a
particularized
historical
method
,
"
marilyn
butler
emphasizes
that
,
"a
genuinely
historical
perspective
discourages
dogmatism
,
by
obliging
us
to
foreground
the
differences
between
our
circumstances
,
aims
,
and
language
,
and
those
of
the
past"
(
44
)
.
only
by
recognizing
those
differences
,
and
the
original
contexts
which

joseph
campbell
article
continues
after
advertisement
one
morning
,
when
i
was
younger
,
i
gave
a
detailed
description
of
my
previous
night



s
dream
to
my
mother
.
when
i
finished
,
she
said
,


i



m
going
to
tell
you
something
.
don



t
ever
share
your
dreams
with
anyone
except
your
spouse
.
it



s
boring
to
listen
to
other
people



s
dreams
.



i
was
offended
at
first
.
how
could
anyone
,
not
to
mention
my
own
mother
,
fail
to
find
my
dreams
as
fascinating
as
i
did
?
but
of
course
she
was
right
;
it



s
almost
always
deadly
to
hear
other
people
talk
about
their
dreams
.
as
a
rule
,
dreams
die
in
the
glare
of
the
waking
world
,
their
shimmering
aura
evaporating
in
the
harsh
air
outside
the
psyche
.
and
yet
,
paradoxically
,
it



s
the
emotional
aura
of
dreams
that
makes
them
feel
so
urgently
worth
sharing
in
the
first
place
.

needless
to
say
,
i
didn



t
listen
to
my
mother
.
that
is
,
i
still
share
my
dreams
promiscuously


just
not
verbally
.

like
so
many
other
writers
and
artists
,
i
employ
dreams
in
my
creative
work
.
they



re
an
engine
,
a
lending
library
.
it



s
a
thrill
to
awake
with
a
strange
,
arresting
image
in
mind
,
or
still
grasping
the
thread
of
an
allegorical
dream
story
.
sometimes
,
a
vision
or
scenario
arrives
as
a
package
deal
:
the
story
is
encased
within
the
vision
,
packed
up
tight
with
a
certain
mood
.
for
me
,
entire
short
stories
have
sprung
from
such
vision
:
a
woman
alone
in
a
pool
,
a
finger
touching
a
brain
,
a
blindfolded
child
.
a
haunting
dream
of
orange
curtains
in
a
hotel
room
has
rolled
into
an
entire
novel
(
in
which
orange
hotel
curtains
do
not
ever
appear
)
.
and
the
power
and
mystery
of
dreams
themselves
inspired
my
novel
the
paper
wasp
,
in
which
the
narrator
illustrates


and
ultimately
enters


her
vivid
,
seemingly
premonitory
dreams
.

article

after

there



s
no
shortage
of
literature
and
art
that
we
know
to
have
sprung
from
dreams
.
as
legend
has
it
,
the
poet
samuel
taylor
coleridge
transcribed
the
first
lines
of


kubla
khan



from
a
dream
;
the
idea
for
frankenstein
came
to
mary
shelley
in
her
sleep
;
robert
louis
stevenson
conceived
of
dr
.
jekyll
and
mr
.
hyde
in
a
consumptive
fever
dream
;
stephen
king
came
up
with
the
idea
for
misery
while
napping
on
a
plane
;
william
styron
had
a
dream
that
inspired
sophie



s
choice
.
one
of
the
most
prolific
dream
miners
of
all
was
edgar
allen
poe
,
who
used
his
frequent
nightmares
in
much
of
his
work
.
and
famously
,
paul
mccartney
dreamed
the
tune
for
the
song


yesterday
.



upon
waking
,
he
asked
his
friends
if
they
knew
it
.


it



s
a
good
little
tune
,



he
said
,


but
i
couldn



t
have
written
it
because
i
dreamt
it
.



dreams
can
feel
like
messages
from
another
place
,
so
it



s
no
surprise
that
many
ancient
cultures
believed
dreams
to
be
transmissions
of
divine
knowledge
.
the
ancient
egyptians
considered
dreams
to
be
oracular
and
held
vivid
dreamers
in
high
regard
.
they
practiced
dream
incubation
and
lucid
dreaming
,
and
employed
dream
guides
called
the


masters
of
secret
things



who
lived
in
dream
temples
.
the
greeks
,
too
,
incubated
dreams
,
and
thought
that
gods
came
to
dreamers
through
a
keyhole
to
deliver
messages
.
the
aboriginal
australians
and
the
iroquois
started
their
day
by
sharing
dreams
,
which
were
considered
a
source
of
guidance
for
both
the
individual
and
the
community
.
the
hindu
religion
,
too
,
believes
that
in
dreams
one
is
given
a
glimpse
of
vishnu
,
whose
own
dreaming
mind
creates
our
reality
.
it
isn



t
difficult
to
understand
where
such
beliefs
come
from
if
you



ve
ever
dreamed
of
reading
a
book
,
sentence
after
lucid
,
elaborate
sentence
.


i
couldn



t
have
written
it
,



you
might
think
,


because
i
dreamt
it
.



it



s
difficult
,
even
paradoxical
,
to
try
to
bear
total
witness
to
dreams
,
akin
to
pinning
down
the
present
moment
,
halting
the
slippage
of
time
.

brain
science
validates
this
phenomenon
.
dreaming
occurs
during
rem
sleep
,
when
the
frontal
lobe
,
the
executive
area
of
the
brain
,
is
shut
down
.
dreams
are
the
mysterious
activity
of
another
part
of
the
brain
,
beneath
the
scrutiny
of
the
frontal
lobe
.
neurologically
speaking
,
we
really
are
receiving
transmissions
from
a
foreign
entity
;
the
unconscious
,
unobserved
self
slips
through
the
keyhole
when
the
guard
is
off
duty
.

even
during
waking
hours
,
the
human
brain
is
divided
:
the
executive-desk
frontal
lobe
and
the
inscrutable
,
intuitive
limbic
system
are
strangers
to
each
other
.
in
sleep
,
they
are
incommunicado
.

because
of
this
deep
rift
,
the
great
majority
of
our
dreams
go
unremembered
,
except
on
a
buried
emotional
level
.
it



s
difficult
,
even
paradoxical
,
to
try
to
bear
total
witness
to
them
,
akin
to
pinning
down
the
present
moment
,
halting
the
slippage
of
time
.
just
as
the
present
can
only
be
considered
in
retrospect
,
the
unconscious
mind
can
only
be
discerned
via
the
remembered
scraps
of
dreams
.
any
glimmers
of
awareness
that
may
come
during
sleep
,
when
a
dream
is
fleetingly
apprehended
,
are
instances
of
the
conscious
half
of
the
brain
briefly
observing
and
translating
the
activity
of
the
submerged
half
:
interpreting
the
enigmatic
message
of
a
stranger
.
these
glimmers
are
rare
and
fleeting
,
occurring
only
during
the
hypnogogic
and
hypnopompic
states
,
the
liminal
states
between
wakefulness
and
sleep
.

in
siphoning
dreams
for
their
work
,
writers
and
artists
are
tapping
a
valuable
well
.
dream
logic
and
imagery
carries
an
uncanny
,
allegorical
quality
that
resonates
deeply
with
readers
and
audiences
.
and
it



s
possible
that
dream
recall
actually
enhances
artistic
output
during
waking
hours
.
scientific
studies
have
confirmed
a
correlation
between
dream
recall
and
creativity
;
those
who
recall
dreams
actually
perform
better
on
creativity
evaluations
.
this
may
be
because
creative
people
are
naturally
better
at
recalling
their
dreams
.
it



s
a
chicken
or
egg
situation
:
do
creative
people
have
more
vivid
and
memorable
dreams
because
they
are
innately
creative
,
or
can
a
brain
become
more
creative
through
strengthening
dream
recall
?
whatever
the
case
,
making
use
of
dreams
in
art
is
a
powerful
way
to
reflect
our
foreign
selves
back
to
ourselves
,
while
projecting
that
mystery
self
out
to
the
world
as
archetypal
image
and
story


dream
as
personalized
myth
,
myth
as
depersonalized
dream
.

,
plugging
into
the
unconscious
provides
a
direct
line
to
the
human
imagination
in
all
its
splendor
and
darkness
.
indeed
,
in
the
midst
of
composing
,
it



s
often
unclear
where
the
words
are
coming
from
.

sentences
and
imagery
sometimes
bubble
up
from
a
hidden
well
that
surprises
the
conscious
,
transcribing
mind
.
some
writers
will
tell
you
that
they
write
in
order
to
exorcise
their
demons
,
cleanse
their
psyches
,
to
bring
their
fears
and
darkness
into
the
light
.
some
will
tell
you
that
it



s
better
than
therapy
.

writing
at
full
tilt
can
be
a
euphoric
state
,
tantamount
to
lucid
dreaming
.
it



s
half-awareness


one
foot
in
,
one
foot
out


a
balance
on
the
brink
of
consciousness
.
it



s
not
just
in
dreams
that
we
can
experience
the
ecstasy
of
flight
and
the
exhilaration
of
omnipotence
,
but
also
when
writing
,
when
the
words
are
flowing
,
the
images
appearing
.
just
as
in
a
lucid
dream
,
this
exhilaration
is
paired
with
the
knowledge
that
it
can



t
last
,
that
it



s
a
temporary
spell
.
soon
,
we



ll
become
too
aware
of
flying
,
and
the
spell
will
break
and
drop
us
to
the
ground
.
still
,
we
endeavor
to
capture
and
recapture
this
ecstasy
of
creative
freedom
,
the
ability
to
travel
lightly
anywhere
at
will
,
the
bliss
of
floating
to
the
treetops
.

if
writing
fiction
is
analogous
to
dreaming
,
the
experience
of
reading
fiction
can
be
,
too
.
when
we



re
reading
,
another
person
is
able
to
intrude
into
our
psyches
through
the
use
of
words
alone
,
remotely
projecting
imagery
onto
the
screens
of
our
minds
,
suffusing
them
with
atmosphere
and
mood
.
we
are
,
in
a
way
,
sharing
a
dream
with
a
stranger
.

and
fiction
,
at
its
best
,
places
a
mirror
before
us
,
evoking
terror
and
wonder
.
it
affects
us
on
an
emotional
level
beyond
language
,
and
brings
a
frisson
of
recognition
.
there



s
a
momentary
astonishment
to
encounter
the
familiar
within
the
strange
,
something
of
our
own
inner
lives
on
the
page
.
there



s
the
eerie
sense
that
the
author
has
somehow
entered
and
seen
into
us
.
the
best
art
carries
this
sense
of
inevitability
,
of
allegory
,
myth
,
dream


a
truth
that
has
always
been
there
,
that
we
already
know
in
some
deep
part
of
ourselves
.

this
flare
of
astonishment
is
arguably
the
purpose
of
art
.
it



s
the
sudden
thinning
of
the
distance
between
us
,
the
erosion
of
barriers
that
have
been
built
and
propped
up
by
our
conscious
,
waking
lives
.

like
a
flash
of
lightning
,
great
art
illuminates
the
human
landscape
in
its
breathtaking
entirety
and
shows
that
the
barriers
are
flimsy
,
false
,
only
temporarily
there
.
all
at
once
,
we
are
taken
outside
ourselves
and
given
a
glimpse
of
the
jungian
collective
unconscious
,
the
subliminal
wholeness
of
life
,
the
enveloping
dream
of
vishnu
.
what
is
the
purpose
of
all
art
,
if
not
to
puncture
the
illusion
of
fragmentation
,
to
reveal
the
commonality
of
human
experience
,
to
return
us


if
briefly


to
those
collective
waters
?

a
dream
is
a
succession
of
images
,
dynamic
scenes
and
situations
,
ideas
,
emotions
,
and
sensations
that
usually
occur
involuntarily
in
the
mind
during
certain
stages
of
sleep
.
^[1]
humans
spend
more
than
two
hours
dreaming
per
night
,
^[2]
and
each
dream
lasts
around
5


20
minutes
.
^[3]

and

practiced

^[5]^[6]
figures
prominently
in
religious
texts
in

,
and

role
in

.
^[7]^[8]
dreamwork
is
similar
,
but
does
not
seek
to
conclude
with
definite
meaning
.
the
scientific
study
of
dreams
is
called
oneirology
.
^[9]
most
modern
dream
study
focuses
on
the
neurophysiology
of
dreams
and
on
proposing
and
testing
hypotheses
regarding
dream
function
.
it
is
not
known
where
in
the
brain
dreams
originate
,
if
there
is
a
single
origin
for
dreams
or
if
multiple
regions
of
the
brain
are
involved
,
or
what
the
purpose
of
dreaming
is
for
the
body
(
or
brain
or
mind
)
.

the
human
dream
experience
and
what
to
make
of
it
has
undergone
sizable
shifts
over
the
course
of
history
.
^[10]^[11]
long
ago
,
according
to
writings
from
mesopotamia
and
ancient
egypt
,
dreams
dictated
post-dream
behaviors
to
an
extent
that
was
sharply
reduced
in
later
millennia
.
^[clarification
needed]
these
ancient
writings
about
dreams
highlight
visitation
dreams
,
where
a
dream
figure
,
usually
a
deity
or
a
prominent
forebear
,
commands
the
dreamer
to
take
specific
actions
,
and
which
may
predict
future
events
.
^[12]^[13]^[14]
framing
the
dream
experience
varies
across
cultures
as
well
as
through
time
.

dreaming
and
sleep
are
intertwined
.
dreams
occur
mainly
in
the
rapid-eye
movement
(
rem
)
stage
of
sleep


when
brain
activity
is
high
and
resembles
that
of
being
awake
.
because
rem
sleep
is
detectable
in
many
species
,
and
because
research
suggests
that
all
mammals
experience
rem
,
^[15]
linking
dreams
to
rem
sleep
has
led
to
conjectures
that
animals
dream
.
however
,
humans
dream
during
non-rem
sleep
,
also
,
and
not
all
rem
awakenings
elicit
dream
reports
.
^[16]
to
be
studied
,
a
dream
must
first
be
reduced
to
a
verbal
report
,
which
is
an
account
of
the
subject
'
s
memory
of
the
dream
,
not
the
subject
'
s
dream
experience
itself
.
therefore
,
dreaming
by
non-humans
is
currently
unprovable
,
as
is
dreaming
by
human
fetuses
and
pre-verbal
infants
.
^[17]
etymology
in
old
english
,
the
word
drēam
was
used
to
describe
"noise"
,
"joy"
,
or
"music"
,
but
not
related
to
the
sleep-induced
brain
activity
.
it
was
only
in
the
13th
century
that
the
word
dream
was
used
to
describe
"a
series
of
thoughts
,
images
or
emotions
occurring
during
sleep"
.

etymologists
believe
that
this
change
was
influenced
due
to
the
old
norse
draumr
,
which
had
the
same
meaning
as
the
word
dream
nowadays
.

^[19]
in
visitation

reported
in
ancient
writings
,
dreamers
were
largely
passive

their

and

,
rebuilt
the
temple
of
ningirsu
as
the
result
of
a
dream
in
which
he
was
told
to
do
so
.
^[6]
after
antiquity
,
the
passive
hearing
of
visitation
dreams
essentially
gave
way
to
visualized
narratives
in
which
the
dreamer
becomes
a
character
who
actively
participates
.

^[22]
results
indicated
that
participants
from
varying
parts
of
the
world
demonstrated
similarity
in
their
dream
content
.
the
only
residue
of
antiquity
'

authoritative

figure

in
the
hall
study
,
the
most
common
emotion
experienced
in
dreams
was
anxiety
.
other
emotions
included
abandonment
,
anger
,
fear
,
joy
,
and
happiness
.
negative
emotions
were
much
more
common
than
positive
ones
.
^[22]
the

data
analysis
showed
that
sexual
dreams
occur
no
more
than
10%
of
the
time
and
are
more
prevalent
in
young
to
mid-teens
.
^[22]
another
study
showed
that
8%
of
both
men

and
women
'
s
dreams
have
sexual
content
.
^[25]
in
some
cases
,
sexual
dreams
may
result
in
orgasms

nocturnal
emissions
.

it
is

.

the
ancient
hebrews
connected
their
dreams
heavily
with
their
religion
,
though
the
hebrews
were
monotheistic
and
believed
that
dreams
were
the
voice
of
one
god
alone
.
hebrews
also
differentiated
between
good
dreams
(
from
god
)
and
bad
dreams
(
from
evil
spirits
)
.
the
hebrews
,
like
many
other
ancient
cultures
,
incubated
dreams
in
order
to
receive
a
divine
revelation
.
for
example
,
the
hebrew
prophet
samuel
would
"lie
down
and
sleep
in
the
temple
at
shiloh
before
the
ark
and
receive
the
word
of
the
lord"
,
and
joseph
interpreted
a
pharaoh
'
s
dream
of
seven
lean
cows
swallowing
seven
fat
cows
as
meaning
the
subsequent
seven
years
would
be
bountiful
,
followed
by
seven
years
of
famine
.
most
of
the
dreams
in
the
bible
are
in
the
book
of
genesis
.
^[59]
christians
mostly
shared
the
beliefs
of
the
hebrews
and
thought
that
dreams
were
of
a
supernatural
character
because
the
old
testament
includes
frequent
stories
of
dreams
with
divine
inspiration
.
the
most
famous
of
these
dream
stories
was
jacob
'
s
dream
of
a
ladder
that
stretches
from

to

.

the

,
attempted
to
teach
christian
populations
to
interpret

.

edgar
has
researched
the
role
of
dreams
in
islam
.
^[60]
he
has
argued
that
dreams
play
an
important
role
in
the
history
of
islam
and
the
lives
of
muslims
,
since
dream
interpretation
is
the
only
way
that
muslims
can
receive
revelations
from
god
since
the
death
of
the
last
prophet
,
muhammad
.
^[61]
according
to
edgar
,
islam
classifies
three
types
of
dreams
.
^[62]
firstly
,
there
is
the
true
dream
(
al-ru



ya
)
,
then
the
false
dream
,
which
may
come
from
the
devil
(
shaytan
)
,
and
finally
,
the
meaningless
everyday
dream
(
hulm
)
.
this
last
dream
could
be
brought
forth
by
the
dreamer
'
s
ego
or
base
appetite
based
on
what
they
experienced
in
the
real
world
.
the
true
dream
is
often
indicated
by
islam
'
s
hadith
tradition
.
^[61]
in
one
narration
by
aisha
,
the
wife
of
the
prophet
,
it
is
said
that
the
prophet
'
s
dreams
would
come
true
like
the
ocean
'
s
waves
.
^[61]
just
as
in
its
predecessors
,
the
quran
also
recounts
the
story
of
joseph
and
his
unique
ability
to
interpret
dreams
.
^[61]
in
both
christianity
and
islam
dreams
feature
in
conversion
stories
.
^[63]
according
to
ancient
authors
,
constantine
the
great
started
his
conversion
to
christianity
because
he
had
a
dream
which
prophesied
that
he
would
win
the
battle
of
the
milvian
bridge
if
he
adopted
the
chi-rho
as
his
battle
standard

morpheus
,
the
greek
god
of
dreams
,
also
sent
warnings
and
prophecies
to
those
who
slept
at
shrines
and
temples
.
the
earliest
greek
beliefs
about
dreams
were
that
their
gods
physically
visited
the
dreamers
,
where
they
entered
through
a
keyhole
,
exiting
the
same
way
after
the
divine
message
was
given
.

antiphon
wrote
the
first
known
greek
book
on
dreams
in
the
5th
century
bce
.
in
that
century
,
other
cultures
influenced
greeks
to
develop
the
belief
that
souls
left
the
sleeping
body
.
^[70]
the
father
of
modern
medicine
,
hippocrates
(
460


375
bce
)
,
thought
dreams
could
analyze
illness
and
predict
diseases
.
^[71]
for
instance
,
a
dream
of
a
dim
star
high
in
the
night
sky
indicated
problems
in
the
head
region
,
while
low
in
the
night
sky
indicated
bowel
issues
.

^[74]
greek
philosopher
plato
(

wrote
that
people
harbor
secret
,
repressed
desires
,
such
as
incest
,
murder
,
adultery
,
and
conquest
,
which
build
up
during
the
day
and
run
rampant
during
the
night
in
dreams
.
^[75]
plato
'
s
student
,
aristotle
(
384


322
bce
)
,
believed
dreams
were
caused
by
processing
incomplete
physiological
activity
during
sleep
,
such
as
eyes
trying
to
see
while
the
sleeper
'
s
eyelids
were
closed
.
^[76]
marcus
tullius
cicero
,
for
his
part
,
believed
that
all
dreams
are
produced
by
thoughts
and
conversations
a
dreamer
had
during
the
preceding
days
.
^[77]
cicero
'
s
somnium
scipionis
described
a
lengthy
dream
vision
,
which
in
turn
was
commented
on
by
macrobius
in
his
commentarii
in
somnium
scipionis
.

herodotus
in
his
the
histories
,
writes
"the
visions
that
occur
to
us
in
dreams
are
,
more
often
than
not
,
the
things
we
have
been
concerned
about
during
the
day
.
"^[78]
the
dreaming
is
a
common
term
within
the
animist
creation
narrative
of
indigenous
australians
for
a
personal
,
or
group
,
creation
and
for
what
may
be
understood
as
the
"timeless
time"
of
formative
creation
and
perpetual
creating
.
^[79]
some
indigenous
american
tribes
and
mexican
populations
believe
that
dreams
are
a
way
of
visiting
and
having
contact
with
their
ancestors
.
^[80]
some
native
american
tribes
have
used
vision
quests
as
a
rite
of
passage
,
fasting
and
praying
until
an
anticipated
guiding
dream
was
received
,
to
be
shared
with
the
rest
of

tissot
(

)
.

beginning
in
the
late
19th
century
,
austrian
neurologist
sigmund
freud
,
founder
of
psychoanalysis
,
theorized
that
dreams
reflect
the
dreamer
'
s
unconscious
mind
and
specifically
that
dream
content
is
shaped
by
unconscious
wish
fulfillment
.
he
argued
that
important
unconscious
desires
often
relate
to
early
childhood
memories
and
experiences
.
^[7]
carl
jung
and
others
expanded
on
freud
'
s
idea
that
dream
content
reflects
the
dreamer
'
s
unconscious
desires
.

dream
interpretation
can
be
a
result
of
subjective
ideas
and
experiences
.
one
study
found
that
most
people
believe
that
"their
dreams
reveal
meaningful
hidden
truths"
.
^[83]
the
researchers
surveyed
students
in
the
united
states
,
south
korea
,
and
india
,
and
found
that
74%
of
indians
,
65%
of
south
koreans
and
56%
of
americans
believed
their
dream
content
provided
them
with
meaningful
insight
into
their
unconscious
beliefs
and
desires
.
this
freudian
view
of
dreaming
was
believed
significantly
more
than
theories
of
dreaming
that
attribute
dream
content
to
memory
consolidation
,
problem-solving
,
or
as
a
byproduct
of
unrelated
brain
activity
.
the
same
study
found
that
people
attribute
more
importance
to
dream
content
than
to
similar
thought
content
that
occurs
while
they
are
awake
.
americans
were
more
likely
to
report
that
they
would
intentionally
miss
their
flight
if
they
dreamt
of
their
plane
crashing
than
if
they
thought
of
their
plane
crashing
the
night
before
flying
(
while
awake
)
,
and
that
they
would
be
as
likely
to
miss
their
flight
if
they
dreamt
of
their
plane
crashing
the
night
before
their
flight
as
if
there
was
an
actual
plane
crash
on
the
route
they
intended
to
take
.
participants
in
the
study
were
more
likely
to
perceive
dreams
to
be
meaningful
when
the
content
of
dreams
was
in
accordance
with
their
beliefs
and
desires
while
awake
.
they
were
more
likely
to
view
a
positive
dream
about
a
friend
to
be
meaningful
than
a
positive
dream
about
someone
they
disliked
,
for
example
,
and
were
more
likely
to
view
a
negative
dream
about
a
person
they
disliked
as
meaningful
than
a
negative
dream
about
a
person
they
liked
.

according
to
surveys
,
it
is
common
for
people
to
feel
their
dreams
are
predicting
subsequent
life
events
.
^[84]
psychologists
have
explained
these
experiences
in
terms
of
memory
biases
,
namely
a
selective
memory
for
accurate
predictions
and
distorted
memory
so
that
dreams
are
retrospectively
fitted
onto
life
experiences
.
^[84]
the
multi-faceted
nature
of
dreams
makes
it
easy
to
find
connections
between
dream
content
and
real
events
.
^[85]
the
term
"veridical
dream"
has
been
used
to
indicate
dreams
that
reveal
or
contain
truths
not
yet
known
to
the
dreamer
,
whether
future
events
or
secrets
.
^[86]
in
one
experiment
,
subjects
were
asked
to
write
down
their
dreams
in
a
diary
.
this
prevented
the
selective
memory
effect
,
and
the
dreams
no
longer
seemed
accurate
about
the
future
.
^[87]
another
experiment
gave
subjects
a
fake
diary
of
a
student
with
apparently
precognitive
dreams
.

this
diary
described
events
from
the
person
'
s
life
,
as
well
as
some
predictive
dreams
and
some
non-predictive
dreams
.
when
subjects
were
asked
to
recall
the
dreams
they
had
read
,
they
remembered
more
of
the
successful
predictions
than
unsuccessful
ones
.

lucid
dreaming
is
the
conscious
perception
of
one
'
s
state
while
dreaming
.
in
this
state
the
dreamer
may
often
have
some
degree
of
control
over
their
own
actions
within
the
dream
or
even
the
characters
and
the
environment
of
the
dream
.
dream
control
has
been
reported
to
improve
with
practiced
deliberate
lucid
dreaming
,
but
the
ability
to
control
aspects
of
the
dream
is
not
necessary
for
a
dream
to
qualify
as
"lucid"


a
lucid
dream
is
any
dream
during
which
the
dreamer
knows
they
are
dreaming
.
^[95]
the
occurrence
of
lucid
dreaming
has
been
scientifically
verified

"oneironaut"

and
someday
there
will
be

this

stupid
believe

brightly

the
idea

discussed
in

it

formally
introduced
to

philosophy
by
descartes
in
the
17th

in
his
meditations
on
first
philosophy

absent-minded
transgression
dreams
of
absent-minded
transgression
(
damt
)
are
dreams
wherein
the
dreamer
absent-mindedly
performs
an
action
that
he
or
she
has
been
trying
to
stop
(
one
classic
example
is
of
a
quitting
smoker
having
dreams
of
lighting
a
cigarette
)
.
subjects
who
have
had
damt
have
reported
waking
with
intense
feelings
of
guilt
.
one
study
found
a
positive
association
between
having
these
dreams
and
successfully
stopping
the
behavior
.

a
daydream
is
a
visionary
fantasy
,
especially
one
of
happy
,
pleasant
thoughts
,
hopes
or
ambitions
,
imagined
as
coming
to
pass
,
and
experienced
while
awake
.
^[116]
there
are
many
different
types
of
daydreams
,
and
there
is
no
consistent
definition
amongst
psychologists
.
^[116]
the
general
public
also
uses
the
term
for
a
broad
variety
of
experiences
.
research
by
harvard
psychologist
deirdre
barrett
has
found
that
people
who
experience
vivid
dreamlike
mental
images
reserve
the
word
for
these
,
whereas
many
other
people
refer
to
milder
imagery
,
realistic
future
planning
,
review
of
memories
or
just
"spacing
out"


i
.
e
.
one
'
s
mind
going
relatively
blank


when
they
talk
about
"daydreaming"
.
^[117]^[118]
while
daydreaming
has
long
been
derided
as
a
lazy
,
non-productive
pastime
,
it
is
now
commonly
acknowledged
that
daydreaming
can
be
constructive
in
some
contexts
.
^[119]
there
are
numerous
examples
of
people
in
creative
or
artistic
careers
,
such
as
composers
,
novelists
and
filmmakers
,
developing
new
ideas
through
daydreaming
.
similarly
,
research
scientists
,
mathematicians
and
physicists
have
developed
new
ideas
by
daydreaming
about
their
subject
areas
.

hallucination
main
article
:
hallucination
a
hallucination
,
in
the
broadest
sense
of
the
word
,
is
a
perception
in
the
absence
of
a
stimulus
.
in
a
stricter
sense
,
hallucinations
are
perceptions
in
a
conscious
and
awake
state
,
in
the
absence
of
external
stimuli
,
and
have
qualities
of
real
perception
,
in
that
they
are
vivid
,
substantial
,
and
located
in
external
objective
space
.
the
latter
definition
distinguishes
hallucinations
from
the
related
phenomena
of
dreaming
,
which
does
not
involve
wakefulness
.

a
nightmare
is
an
unpleasant
dream
that
can
cause
a
strong
negative
emotional
response
from
the
mind
,
typically
fear
or
horror
,
but
also
despair
,
anxiety
and
great
sadness
.
the
dream
may
contain
situations
of
danger
,
discomfort
,
psychological
or
physical
terror
.
sufferers
usually
awaken
in
a
state
of
distress
and
may
be
unable
to
return
to
sleep
for
a
prolonged
period
of
time
.

night
terror
main
article
:
night
terror
a
night
terror
,
also
known
as
a
sleep
terror
or
pavor
nocturnus
,
is
a
parasomnia
disorder
that
predominantly
affects
children
,
causing
feelings
of
terror
or
dread
.
night
terrors
should
not
be
confused
with
nightmares
,
which
are
bad
dreams
that
cause
the
feeling
of
horror
or
fear
.
^[121]
déjà
vu
main
article
:
déjà
vu
one
theory
of
déjà
vu
attributes
the
feeling
of
having
previously
seen
or
experienced
something
to
having
dreamed
about
a
similar
situation
or
place
,
and
forgetting
about
it
until
one
seems
to
be
mysteriously
reminded
of
the
situation
or
the
place
while
awake
.

melatonin
main
article
:
melatonin
melatonin
is
a
natural
hormone
secreted
by
the
brain
'
s
pineal
gland
,
inducing
nocturnal
behaviors
in
animals
and
sleep
in
humans
during
nighttime
.
chemically
isolated
in
1958
,
melatonin
has
been
marketed
as
a
sleep
aid
since
the
1990s
and
is
currently
sold
in
the
united
states
as
an
over-the-counter
product
requiring
no
prescription
.
anecdotal
reports
and
formal
research
studies
over
the
past
few
decades
have
established
a
link
between
melatonin
supplementation
and
more
vivid
dreams
.

have
you
ever
dreamed
about
someone
you
know
?

dreams
are
a
mix
of
the
strange
and
the
familiar
.
while
sometimes
in
nighttime
dreams
we
interact
with
people
we



ve
never
met
before
,
often
we
find
that
we
know
the
people
we
see
and
speak
to
while
asleep
.
is
there
something
for
us
to
learn
in
these
interactions
?

perhaps
surprisingly
,
the
material
in
our
night
dreams
and
even
daydreams
offer
unexpected
ways
to
improve
our
existing
,
waking
relationships
.
with
a
little
reflection
,
they
can
help
us
expand
our
self-awareness
and
provide
insights
about
the
ways
we
interact
with
others
.
here
are
three
tools
for
using
our
nighttime
dreams
and
daydreaming
to
improve
our
relationships
.

relationship
tool
1
:
dreams
hold
other
perspectives
challenges
are
inevitable
in
any
relationship
.
however
,
when
we
encounter
relationship
roadblocks
,
we
usually
retreat
to
our
most
familiar
scripts
,
seeing
the
other
person
through
a
narrow
lens
.
when
we



re
angry
at
a
spouse
,
for
example
,
it
may
seem
impossible
to
remember
them
as
the
person
we
fell
in
love
with
;
a
flare-up
with
our
boss
and
we
forget
what
a
chance
they
took
on
us
early
in
our
career
.

yet
our
nighttime
dreams
can
help
return
us
to
a
more
expanded
view
.

while
we
dream
about
people
we
know
in
waking
time
,
rarely
do
the
familiar
faces
in
our
dreams
behave
exactly
as
we
would
expect
them
to
in
waking
life
.
the
staid
,
strict
mother
is
suddenly
carefree
;
the
couch-surfing
,
irresponsible
brother-in-law
now
owns
a
modern
,
upscale
house
.
waking
up
,
we
have
the
possibility
to
curiously
reflect
on
the
differences
.
we
can
ask
ourselves
whether
there
is
something
more
or
different
to
the
person
than
the
way
we



ve
been
viewing
them
in
waking
time
.

often
the
difference
between
a
person
in
our
dreams
and
the
way
we
perceive
them
in
waking
life
puts
the
new
perspectives
into
motion
without
much
effort
.
from
time
to
time
,
though
,
we
might
even
get
something
more
direct
.
for
example
,
once
i
dreamed
of
a
work
colleague
who
,
in
waking
life
,
was
critical
of
new
ideas
,
making
discussions
difficult
.
in
the
dream
,
the
same
person
knocked
on
my
door
and
,
when
i
opened
it
,
said
,


i



m
not
such
a
bad
egg
,
after
all
.



in
the
dream
,
i
simply
listened
,
then
shut
the
door
.
but
in
the
morning
,
reflecting
on
the
dream
,
i
asked
myself
whether
there
was
something
i
was
missing
.
the
next
time
a
prickly
work
conversation
arose
i
decided
to
be
curious
instead
of
closed
off
.
i
noticed
that
underlying
the
criticisms
of
new
ideas
was
a
respect
for
process
and
stability
.
i
appreciated
such
a
point
of
view
,
and
my
own
prickliness
eased
as
a
result
,
shifting
our
dialogues
.

relationship
tool
2
:
imagining
how
the
other
person
feels
most
impasses
begin
with
our
own
hurt
feelings
.
to
move
out
of
that
,
we
have
to
bring
in
other
perspectives
,
including
that
of
the
other
person
.

daydreaming
utilizes
the
same
default
network
of
neural
processing
that
operates
in
our
night
dreams
.
we
think
about
this
cognitive
powerhouse
as
the
seat
of
the
imagination
,
but
we
also
use
it
to
evaluate
sociomoral
scenarios
.
for
example
,
we
use
it
to
reflect
on
an
event
and
the
different
ways
that
it
could
have
played
out
,
or
to
consider
how
other
people
may
have
felt
about
our
actions
.

if
you
think
about
it
,
it
takes
imagination
to
step
into
someone
else



s
shoes
and
sense
how
they
might
feel
.
likewise
,
it
takes
creativity
to
come
up
with
solutions
for
moving
out
of
conflict
and
back
to
communication
.
imagining
the
same
event
from
the
other
person



s
point
of
view
,
and
finding
new
ways
of
seeing
the
situation
,
helps
us
move
beyond
impasses
and
back
to
dialogue
.

relationship
tool
3
:


they



are
me
one
approach
to
understanding
dreams
is
to
view
each
of
the
aspects
of
a
dream
as
an
aspect
of
the
dreamer
.
in
other
words
,
the
people
we
think
of
as
being
separate
others
are
in
fact
reflecting
a
part
of
our
own
self
.

what
better
way
to
engender
compassion
than
to
remember
our
own
multiple
facets
,
including
the
occasional
less-favorable
qualities
and
traits
we
tend
to
assign
to
others
.
peering
into
the
mirror
of
our
dreams
,
we
can
consider
,
for
example
,
our
own
moments
of
acting
staid
and
rigid
,
shirking
responsibility
,
or
being
a
bad
egg
.

dreaming
essential
reads
what
makes
some
dreams
impossible
to
forget
?

what
are
dreams
made
of
?

we
all
have
moments
that
could
use
a
little
tweaking
,
and
recognizing
that
can
open
a
door
to
renewed
conversation
.
at
the
same
time
,
the
myriad
perspectives
in
our
dreams
remind
us
that
whatever
our
current
facet
,
it
is
merely
one
of
many
aspects
,
and
others
are
available
.

knowing
that
helps
us
to
shift
into
a
more
positive
aspect
of
ourselves
.

dreams
and
our
imagination
offer
a
library
of
feelings
,
solutions
,
perspectives
,
and
experiences
that
we
can
draw
on
to
recognize
more
about
ourselves
and
our
relationships
.
we
can
get
along
better
with
others
,
and
in
the
world
,
simply
by
looking
within
at
this
treasure
trove
that
our
own
mind
generates
for
us
on
a
nightly
basis
,
or
that
we
sink
into
in
our
daydreaming
.
you



ll
be
surprised
how
much
you
can
learn
from
people
you
meet
(
and
know
)
when
you
close
your
eyes

philosophy
of
dreaming
according
to
owen
flanagan
(
2000
)
,
there
are
four
major
philosophical
questions
about
dreaming
:
1
.
how
can
i
be
sure
i
am
not
always
dreaming
?

2
.
can
i
be
immoral
in
dreams
?

3
.
are
dreams
conscious
experiences
that
occur
during
sleep
?

4
.
does
dreaming
have
an
evolutionary
function
?

these
interrelated
questions
cover
philosophical
domains
as
diverse
as
metaphysics
,
epistemology
,
ethics
,
scientific
methodology
,
and
the
philosophy
of
biology
,
mind
and
language
.
this
article
covers
the
four
questions
and
also
looks
at
some
newly
emerging
philosophical
questions
about
dreams
:
5
.
is
dreaming
an
ideal
scientific
model
for
consciousness
research
?

6
.
is
dreaming
an
instance
of
hallucinating
or
imagining
?

section
1
introduces
the
traditional
philosophical
question
that
descartes
asked
himself
,
a
question
which
has
championed
scepticism
about
the
external
world
.
how
can
i
be
sure
i
am
not
always
dreaming
,
or
dreaming
right
now
?
philosophers
have
typically
looked
for
features
that
distinguish
dreams
from
waking
life
and
one
key
debate
centres
on
whether
it
is
possible
to
feel
pain
in
a
dream
.

section
2
surveys
the
ethics
of
dreaming
.
the
classical
view
of
augustine
is
contrasted
with
more
abstract
ethical
positions
,
namely
,
those
of
the
deontologist
,
the
consequentialist
and
the
virtue
ethicist
.
the
notion
of
lucid
dreaming
is
examined
here
in
light
of
the
question
of
responsibility
during
dreaming
and
how
we
treat
other
dream
characters
.

sections
3
covers
the
various
different
positions
,
objections
and
replies
to
question
3
:
the
debate
about
whether
dreaming
is
,
or
is
not
,
a
conscious
state
.
the
challenges
from
malcolm
and
dennett
are
covered
.

these
challenges
question
the
authority
of
the
common-sense
view
of
dreaming
as
a
consciously
experienced
state
.
malcolm
argues
that
the
concept
of
dreaming
is
incoherent
,
while
dennett
puts
forward
a
theory
of
dreaming
without
appealing
to
consciousness
.

section
4
covers
the
evolutionary
debate
,
where
empirical
work
ultimately
leaves
us
uncertain
of
the
extent
to
which
natural
selection
has
shaped
dreaming
,
if
at
all
.
early
approaches
by
freud
and
jung
are
reviewed
,
followed
by
approaches
by
flanagan
and
revonsuo
.
though
freud
,
jung
and
revonsuo
have
argued
that
dreaming
is
functional
,
flanagan
represents
a
view
shared
by
many
neuroscientists
that
dreaming
has
no
function
at
all
.

section
5
looks
at
questions
5
and
6
.
question
5
is
about
the
cutting
edge
issue
of
precisely
how
dreaming
should
be
integrated
into
the
research
program
of
consciousness
.
should
dreaming
be
taken
as
a
scientific
model
of
consciousness
?
might
dreaming
play
another
role
such
as
a
contrast
analysis
with
other
mental
states
?
question
6
,
which
raises
a
question
of
the
exact
qualitative
nature
of
dreaming
,
has
a
longer
history
,
though
it
is
also
receiving
contemporary
attention
.
the
section
outlines
reasons
favouring
the
orthodox
view
of
psychology
,
that
dream
imagery
is
perceptual
(
hallucinatory
)
,
and
reasons
favouring
the
philosophical
challenge
to
that
orthodoxy
,
that
dreams
are
ultimately
imaginative
in
nature
.

descartes



dream
argument
descartes
strove
for
certainty
in
the
beliefs
we
hold
.
in
his
meditations
on
first
philosophy
he
wanted
to
find
out
what
we
can
believe
with
certainty
and
thereby
claim
as
knowledge
.
he
begins
by
stating
that
he
is
certain
of
being
seated
by
the
fire
in
front
of
him
.

he
then
dismisses
the
idea
that
this
belief
could
be
certain
because
he
has
been
deceived
before
in
dreams
where
he
has
similarly
been
convinced
that
he
was
seated
by
a
fire
,
only
to
wake
and
discover
that
he
was
only
dreaming
that
he
was
seated
by
a
fire
.
how
can
i
know
that
i
am
not
now
dreaming
?
is
the
resulting
famous
question
descartes
asked
himself
.
though
descartes
was
not
the
first
to
ask
himself
this
question
(
see
zhuangzi



s
eponymous
work
,
plato



s
theaetetus
and
aristotle



s
metaphysics
)
he
was
the
first
philosopher
to
doggedly
pursue
and
try
to
answer
the
question
.
in
answering
the
question
,
due
to
the
sensory
deception
of
dreams
,
descartes
believes
that
we
cannot
trust
our
senses
in
waking
life
(
without
invoking
a
benevolent
god
who
would
surely
not
deceive
us
)
.

the
phenomenon
of
dreaming
is
used
as
key
evidence
for
the
sceptical
hypothesis
that
everything
we
currently
believe
to
be
true
could
be
false
and
generated
by
a
dream
.
descartes
holds
the
common-sense
view
that
dreams
,
which
regularly
occur
in
all
people
,
are
a
sequence
of
experiences
often
similar
to
those
we
have
in
waking
life
(
this
has
come
to
be
labelled
as
the


received
view



of
dreaming
)
.
a
dream
makes
it
feel
as
though
the
dreamer
is
carrying
out
actions
in
waking
life
,
for
during
a
dream
we
do
not
realize
that
it
is
a
dream
we
are
experiencing
.
descartes
claims
that
the
experience
of
a
dream
could
in
principle
be
indistinguishable
from
waking
life



whatever
apparent
subjective
differences
there
are
between
waking
life
and
dreaming
,
they
are
insufficient
differences
to
gain
certainty
that
i
am
not
now
dreaming
.
descartes
is
left
unsure
that
the
objects
in
front
of
him
are
real



whether
he
is
dreaming
of
their
existence
or
whether
they
really
are
there
.
dreaming
was
the
first
source
for
motivating
descartes



method
of
doubt
which
came
to
threaten
perceptual
and
introspective
knowledge
.
in
this
method
,
he
would
use
any
means
to
subject
a
statement
or
allegedly
true
belief
to
the
most
critical
scrutiny
.

descartes



dream
argument
began
with
the
claim
that
dreams
and
waking
life
can
have
the
same
content
.
there
is
,
descartes
alleges
,
a
sufficient
similarity
between
the
two
experiences
for
dreamers
to
be
routinely
deceived
into
believing
that
they
are
having
waking
experiences
while
we
are
actually
asleep
and
dreaming
.
the
dream
argument
has
similarities
to
his
later
evil
demon
argument
.
according
to
this
later
argument
,
i
cannot
be
sure
anything
i
believe
for
i
may
just
be
being
deceived
by
a
malevolent
demon
.
both
arguments
have
the
same
structure
:
nothing
can
rule
out
my
being
duped
into
believing
i
am
having
experience
x
,
when
i
am
really
in
state
y
,
hence
i
cannot
have
knowledge
z
,
about
my
current
state
.
even
if
the
individuals
happen
to
be
right
in
their
belief
that
they
are
not
being
deceived
by
an
evil
demon
and
even
if
individuals
really
are
having
a
waking
life
experience
,
they
are
left
unable
to
distinguish
reality
from
their
dream
experiences
in
order
to
gain
certainty
in
their
belief
that
they
are
not
now
dreaming
.

b
.
objections
and
replies
since
the
meditations
on
first
philosophy
was
published
,
descartes



argument
has
been
replied
to
.
one
main
claim
that
has
been
replied
to
is
the
idea
that
there
are
no
certain
marks
to
distinguish
waking
consciousness
from
dreaming
.
hobbes
believed
that
an
absence
of
the
absurd
in
waking
life
was
a
key
difference
(
hobbes
,
1651
:
part
1
,
chapter
2
)
.
though
sleeping
individuals
are
too
wrapped
up
in
the
absurdity
of
their
dreams
to
be
able
to
distinguish
their
states
,
an
individual
who
is
awake
can
tell
,
simply
because
the
absurdity
is
no
longer
there
during
wakefulness
.
locke
compared
real
pain
to
dream
pain
.
he
asks
descartes
to
consider
the
difference
between
dreaming
of
being
in
the
fire
and
actually
being
in
the
fire
(
locke
,
1690
:
book
4
,
chapter
2
,
§
2
)
.
locke



s
claim
is
that
we
cannot
have
physical
pain
in
dreams
as
we
do
in
waking
life
.
his
claim
,
if
true
,
undermines
descartes



premise
that
there
are
no
certain
marks
to
distinguish
dreaming
from
waking
life
such
that
we
could
ever
be
sure
we
are
in
one
or
the
other
states
.

descartes
thought
that
dreams
are
protean
(
hill
,
2004b
)
.
by


protean



,
hill
means
that
dream
experience
can
replicate
the
panoply
of
any
possible
waking
life
experience
;
to
put
it
negatively
,
there
is
no
experience
in
waking
life
that
could
not
be
realistically
simulated
(
and
thereby
be
phenomenally
indistinguishable
)
in
dreams
.
this
protean
claim
was
necessary
for
descartes
to
mount
his
sceptical
argument
about
the
external
world
.
after
all
,
if
there
was
even
one
experience
during
waking
life
which
simply
could
not
occur
during
dreaming
,
then
,
in
that
moment
at
least
,
we
could
be
sure
we
are
awake
and
in
contact
with
the
external
world
,
rather
than
dreaming
.
locke
alleged
that
he
had
found
a
gap
in
this
protean
claim
:
we
do
not
and
cannot
feel
pain
in
dreams
.

the
notion
of
pain
occurring
in
a
dream
has
now
been
put
to
the
test
in
a
number
of
scientific
studies
through
quantitative
analysis
of
the
content
of
dream
diaries
in
the
case
of
ordinary
dreams
and
also
by
participating
lucid
dreamers
.
the
conclusion
reached
independently
by
these
various
studies
is
that
the
occurrence
of
sharply
localized
pains
can
occur
in
dreams
,
though
they
are
rare
(
zadra
,
and
others
1998
;
laberge
&
degracia
,
2000
)
.
according
to
the
empirical
work
then
,
locke
is
wrong
about
his
claim
,
though
he
might
still
query
whether
really
agonizing
and
ongoing
pain
(
as
in
his
original
request
of
being
in
a
fire
)
might
not
be
possible
in
dreams
.
the
empirical
work
supports
descartes



conviction
that
dreams
can
recapitulate
any
waking
state
,
meaning
that
there
is
no
essential
difference
between
waking
and
dreaming
thereby
ruling
out
certainty
that
this
is
not
now
a
dream
.

another
common
attempt
to
distinguish
waking
life
from
dreaming
is
the


principle
of
coherence



(
malcolm
,
1959
:
chapter
17
)
.
we
are
awake
and
not
asleep
dreaming
if
we
can
connect
our
current
experiences
to
the
overall
course
of
our
lives
.
essentially
,
through
using
the
principle
of
coherence
,
we
can
think
more
critically
in
waking
life
.
hobbes
seems
to
adhere
to
something
like
the
principle
of
coherence
in
his
appeal
to
absurdity
as
a
key
feature
of
dreams
.
though
dreams
do
have
a
tendency
to
involve
a
lack
of
critical
thinking
,
it
still
seems
possible
that
we
could
wake
with
a
dream
connecting
to
the
overall
course
of
our
lives
.

it
is
generally
accepted
that
there
is
no
certain
way
to
distinguish
dreaming
from
waking
life
,
though
the
claim
that
this
ought
to
undermine
our
knowledge
in
any
way
is
controversial
.

for
an
alternative
response
to
descartes



sceptical
dream
argument
see
sosa
(
2007
)
,
who
says
that


in
dreaming
we
do
not
really
believe
;
we
only
make-believe
.



he
argues
that
in
dreaming
we
actually
only
ever
imagine
scenarios
,
which
never
involve
deceptive
beliefs
,
and
so
we
have
no
reason
to
feel
our
ordinary
waking
life
beliefs
can
be
undermined
.
descartes
relied
on
a
notion
of
belief
that
was
the
same
in
both
dreaming
and
waking
life
.
of
course
,
if
i
have
never
believed
,
in
sleep
,
that
i
was
seated
by
the
fire
when
i
was
actually
asleep
in
bed
,
then
none
of
my
dreams
challenge
the
perceptual
and
introspective
beliefs
i
have
during
waking
life
.
ichikawa
(
2008
)
agrees
with
sosa
that
in
dreams
we
imagine
scenarios
(
rather
than
believe
we
are
engaged
in
scenarios
as
though
awake
)
,
but
he
argues
in
contrast
to
sosa
,
that
this
does
not
avoid
scepticism
about
the
external
world
.
even
when
dreams
trade
in
imaginings
rather
than
beliefs
,
the
dreams
still
create
subjectively
indistinguishable
experiences
from
waking
experience
.
due
to
the
similarity
in
experience
,
it
would
be


epistemically
irresponsible



to
believe
that
we
are
engaged
in
waking
experiences
when
we
think
we
are
on
the
sole
basis
that
we
imagine
our
dream
experiences
and
imaginings
are
not
beliefs
.
i
still
cannot
really
tell
the
difference
between
the
experiences
.
the
new
worry
is
whether
the
belief
i
have
in
waking
life
is
really
a
belief
,
rather
than
an
imagining
during
dreaming
and
so
scepticism
is
not
avoided
,
so
ichikawa
claims
.

.
the
ethics
of
dreaming
since
the
late
twentieth
century
,
discussion
of
the
moral
and
criminal
responsibility
of
dreaming
has
been
centred
on
sleep
walking
,
where
sleep-walkers
have
harmed
others
.
the
assessment
has
typically
been
carried
out
in
practical
,
rather
than
theoretical
,
settings
,
for
example
law
courts
.
setting
aside
the
notion
of
sleepwalking
,
philosophers
are
more
concerned
with
the
phenomenology
of
ordinary
dreams
.
does
the
notion
of
right
and
wrong
apply
to
dreams
themselves
,
as
well
as
actions
done
by
sleepwalkers
?

saint
augustine
on
the
morality
of
dreaming
saint
augustine
,
seeking
to
live
a
morally
perfect
life
,
was
worried
about
some
of
the
actions
he
carried
out
in
dreams
.
for
somebody
who
devoted
his
life
to
celibacy
,
his
sexual
dreams
of
fornication
worried
him
.
in
his
confessions
(
book
x
;
chapter
30
)
,
he
writes
to
god
.
he
talks
of
his
success
in
quelling
sexual
thoughts
and
earlier
habits
from
his
life
before
his
religious
conversion
.
but
he
declares
that
in
dreams
he
seems
to
have
little
control
over
committing
the
acts
that
he
avoids
during
the
waking
day
.
he
rhetorically
asks


am
i
not
myself
during
sleep
?



believing
that
it
really
is
him
who
is
the
central
character
of
his
dreams
.
in
trying
to
solve
the
problem
augustine
appeals
to
the
apparent
experiential
difference
between
waking
and
dreaming
life
.
he
draws
a
crucial
distinction
between


happenings



and


actions
.



dreams
fall
into
the
former
category
.
augustine
was
not
carrying
out
actions
but
was
rather
undergoing
an
experience
which
happened
to
him
without
choice
on
his
part
.
by
effectively
removing
agency
from
dreaming
,
we
cannot
be
responsible
for
what
happens
in
our
dreams
.
as
a
result
,
the
notion
of
sin
or
moral
responsibility
cannot
be
applied
to
our
dreams
(
flanagan
,
2000
:
p
.
18
;
pp
.

183
)
.

according
to
augustine
,
only
actions
are
morally
evaluable
.
he
is
committed
to
the
claim
that
all
events
that
occur
in
dreams
are
non-actions
.
the
claim
that
actions
do
not
occur
during
sleep
is
brought
into
question
by
lucid
dreams
which
seem
to
involve
genuine
actions
and
decision
making
processes
whereby
dreaming
individuals
can
control
,
affect
and
alter
the
course
of
the
dream
.
the
success
of
augustine



s
argument
hinges
on
there
being
no
actions
in
dreams
.
lucid
dreaming
is
therefore
evidence
against
this
premise
.
we
have
now
seen
augustine



s
argument
that
moral
notions
never
apply
to
dreams
fail
(
because
they
can
involve
actions
rather
than
happenings
)
.
in
the
next
section
we
will
see
what
the
two
main
ethical
positions
might
say
on
the
issue
of
right
and
wrong
in
dreams
.

b
.
consequentialist
vs
.
deontological
positions
on
dreaming
dreaming
is
an
instance
of
a
more
general
concern
about
a
subset
of
thoughts



fantasies



that
occur
,
potentially
without
affecting
behaviour
we
seem
to
carry
out
actions
during
dreams
in
simulated
realities
involving
other
characters
.
so
perhaps
we
ought
to
consider
whether
we
are
morally
responsible
for
actions
in
dreams
.
more
generally
,
are
we
morally
obliged
to
not
entertain
certain
thoughts
,
even
if
these
thoughts
do
not
affect
our
later
actions
and
do
not
harm
others
?
the
same
issue
might
be
pressed
with
the
use
of
violent
video
games
,
though
the
link
to
later
behaviour
is
more
controversial
.
some
people
enjoy
playing
violent
video
games
and
the
more
graphic
the
better
.
is
that
unethical
in
and
of
itself
?
why
should
we
excuse
people



s
thoughts



when
,
if
they
were
carried
out
as
actual
actions
they
would
be
grossly
wrong
?
dreaming
is
perhaps
a
special
instance
because
in
ordinary
dreams
we
believe
we
are
carrying
out
actions
in
real
life
.
what
might
the
two
main
moral
theories
say
about
the
issue
,
with
the
assumption
in
place
that
what
we
do
in
dreams
does
not
affect
our
behaviour
in
waking
life
?

consequentialism
is
a
broad
family
of
ethical
doctrines
which
always
assesses
an
action
in
terms
of
the
consequences
it
has
.
there
are
two
separate
issues



ethical
and
empirical
.
the
empirical
question
asks
whether
dreams
,
fantasies
and
video
games
are
really
without
behavioural
consequence
towards
others
.
to
be
clear
,
the
consequentialist
is
not
arguing
that
dreams
do
not
have
any
consequences
,
only
that
if
they
really
do
have
no
consequences
then
they
are
not
morally
evaluable
or
should
be
deemed
neutral
.

consequentialist
theories
may
well
argue
that
,
provided
that
dreams
really
do
not
affect
my
behaviour
later
,
it
is
not
morally
wrong
to


harm



other
dream
characters
,
even
in
lucid
dreaming
.
the
more
liberal
consequentialists
might
even
see
value
in
these
instances
of
free
thought
.
that
is
,
there
might
be
some
intrinsic
good
in
allowing
such
freedom
of
the
mind
but
this
is
not
a
value
that
can
be
outweighed
by
actual
harm
to
others
,
so
the
consequentialists
might
claim
.
if
having
such
lucid
dreams
makes
me
nicer
to
people
in
waking
life
,
then
the
consequentialist
will
actually
endorse
such
activity
during
sleep
.

consequentialists
will
grant
their
argument
even
though
dream
content
has
an
intentional
relation
to
other
people
.
namely
,
dreams
can
often
have
singular
content
.
singular
content
,
or
singular
thought
,
is
to
be
contrasted
with
general
content
(
the
notion
of
singular
thought
is
somewhat
complex
.
readers
should
consult
jeshion
,
2010
)
.
if
i
simply
form
a
mental
representation
of
a
blond
hollywood
actor
,
the
features
of
the
representation
might
be
too
vague
to
pick
out
any
particular
individual
.
my
representation
could
equally
be
fulfilled
by
brad
pitt
,
steve
mcqueen
,
a
fictional
movie
star
or
countless
other
individuals
.

if
i
deliberately
think
of
brad
pitt
,
or
if
the
images
come
to
me
detailed
enough
,
then
my
thought
does
not
have
general
content
but
is
about
that
particular
individual
.
dreams
are
not
always
about
people
with
general
features
(
though
they
can
be
)
,
but
are
rather
often
about
people
the
sleeping
individual
is
actually
acquainted
with



particular
people
from
that
individual



s
own
life



family
,
friends
,
and
so
forth
.

deontological
theories
,
in
stark
contrast
to
consequential
theories
,
believe
that
we
have
obligations
to
act
and
think
,
or
not
act
and
think
,
in
certain
ways
regardless
of
effects
on
other
people
.
according
to
deontological
moral
theories
,
i
have
a
duty
to
never
entertain
certain
thoughts
because
it
is
wrong
in
itself
.
deontological
theories
see
individuals
as
more
important
than
mere
consequences
of
action
.

individuals
are


ends-in-themselves



and
not
the
means
to
a
desirable
state
of
affairs
.
since
dreams
are
often
actually
about
real
people
,
i
am
not
treating
that
individual
as
an
end-in-itself
if
i
chose
to
harm
their


dream
representative



.
the
basic
deontological
maxim
to
treat
someone
as
an
end
rather
than
a
means
to
my
entertainment
can
apply
to
dreams
.

as
the
debate
between
deontologists
and
consequentialists
plays
out
,
nuanced
positions
will
reveal
themselves
.
perhaps
there
is
room
for
agreement
between
the
consequentialist
and
deontologist
.
maybe
i
can
carry
out
otherwise
immoral
acts
on
dream
characters
with
general
features
where
these
characters
do
not
represent
any
particular
individuals
of
the
waking
world
.
some
deontologists
might
still
be
unhappy
with
the
notion
that
in
dreams
one
crucial
element
of
singular
content
remains



we
represent
ourselves
in
dreams
.
the
arch-deontologist
kant
will
argue
that
one
is
not
treating
oneself
as
an
end-in-itself
but
a
means
to
other
ends
by
carrying
out
the
acts
;
namely
,
there
is
something
inherently
wrong
about
even
pretending
to
carry
out
an
immoral
action
because
in
doing
so
we
depersonalize
ourselves
.
other
deontologists
might
want
to
speak
about
fantasies
being
different
from
dreams
.
fantasies
are
actions
,
where
i
sit
down
and
decide
to
indulge
my
daydreams
,
whereas
dreams
might
be
more
passive
and
therefore
might
respect
the
augustinian
distinction
between
actions
and
happenings
.
on
this
view
,
i
am
not
using
someone
as
a
means
to
an
end
if
i
am
just
passively
dreaming
whereas
i
am
if
i
start
actively
thinking
about
that
individual
.
so
maybe
the
deontologist
case
only
applies
to
lucid
dreaming
,
where
augustine



s
distinction
would
still
be
at
work
.
this
might
exempt
a
large
number
of
dreams
from
being
wicked
,
but
not
all
of
them
.

c
.
virtue
ethics
of
dreaming
deontology
and
consequentialism
are
the
two
main
moral
positions
.
the
third
is
virtue
ethics
,
which
emphasizes
the
role
of
character
.
this
moral
approach
involves
going
beyond
actions
of
right
and
wrong
,
avoiding
harm
and
maximizing
pleasure
,
and
instead
considers
an
individual
for
his
or
her
overall
life
,
how
to
make
it
a
good
one
and
develop
that
individual



s
character
.
where
might
dreaming
fit
in
with
the
third
moral
position



that
of
the
virtue
ethicist
?
virtue
ethics
takes
the
question


what
is
the
right
action
?



and
turns
it
into
the
broader
question
:


how
should
i
live
?



the
question


can
we
have
immoral
dreams
?



needs
to
be
opened
up
to
:


what
can
i
get
out
of
dreaming
to
help
me
acquire
virtuousness
?



the
virtue
ethics
of
dreaming
might
be
pursued
in
a
freudian
or
jungian
vein
.
dreams
arguably
put
us
in
touch
with
our
unconscious
and
indirectly
tell
us
about
our
motives
and
habits
in
life
:


[i]t
is
in
the
world
of
dreaming
that
the
unconscious
is
working
out
its
powerful
dynamics
.
it
is
there
that
the
great
forces
do
battle
or
combine
to
produce
the
attitudes
,
ideals
,
beliefs
,
and
compulsions
that
motivate
most
of
our
behavior
once
we
become
sensitive
to
dreams
,
we
discover
that
every
dynamic
in
a
dream
is
manifesting
itself
in
some
way
in
our
practical
lives


in
our
actions
,
relationships
,
decisions
,
automatic
routines
,
urges
,
and
feelings
.



(
johnson
,
2009
:
p
.

)
similarly
:


studying
our
own
dreams
can
be
valuable
in
all
sorts
of
ways
.
they
can
be
reveal
our
inner
motivations
and
hopes
,
help
us
face
our
fears
,
encourage
growing
awareness
and
even
be
a
source
of
creativity
and
insight
.



(
blackmore
,
2004
:
p
.
338
)
in
order
to
achieve
happiness
,
fulfilment
and
developing
virtuousness
we
owe
it
to
ourselves
to
recall
and
pay
attention
to
our
dreams
.

however
,
this
line
of
argument
relies
on
the
claim
that
dreams
really
do
function
in
a
way
that
freud
or
jung
thought
they
do
,
which
is
controversial
:
dream
analysis
of
any
kind
lacks
scientific
status
and
is
more
of
an
art
.
but
then
social
dynamics
and
the
development
of
character
is
more
of
an
art
than
a
science
.
virtue
ethics
is
perhaps
the
opposite
side
of
the
coin
of
psychotherapy
.
the
former
focuses
on
positive
improvement
of
character
,
whereas
the
latter
focuses
on
avoiding
negative
setbacks
in
mind
and
behaviour
whether
psychotherapy
should
be
used
more
for
positive
improvement
of
character
is
a
question
approached
in
the
philosophy
of
medicine
.
these
considerations
touch
on
a
further
question
of
whether
dreams
should
be
used
in
therapy
.

certain
changes
people
make
in
waking
life
do
eventually


show
up



in
dreams
.
dreams
,
as
unconsciously
instantiated
,
capture
patterns
of
thought
from
waking
life
.
new
modes
of
thinking
can
be
introduced
and
this
is
the
process
by
which
people
learn
to
lucid
dream
.
by
periodically
introducing
thoughts
about
whether
one
is
awake
or
not
during
the
day
,
every
day
for
some
period
of
time
,
this
pattern
of
thinking
eventually
occurs
in
dreams
.
by
constantly
asking


am
i
awake
?



in
the
day
it
becomes
more
likely
to
ask
oneself
in
a
dream
,
to
realize
that
one
is
not
awake
and
answer
in
the
negative
(
blackmore
,
1991
)
.
with
the
possibility
that
dreams
do
capture
waking
life
thinking
and
the
notion
that
one
can
learn
to
lucid
dream
one
may
ask
whether
augustine
tried
his
hardest
at
stopping
the
dreams
that
troubled
him
and
whether
he
was
really
as
successful
at
quelling
sexual
urges
in
waking
life
as
he
thought
he
was
.

ordinary
dreams
are
commonly
thought
to
not
actually
involve
choices
and
corresponding
agency
.
lucid
dreaming
invokes
our
ability
to
make
choices
,
often
to
the
same
extent
as
in
waking
life
.
lucid
dreaming
represents
an
example
of
being
able
to
live
and
act
in
a
virtual
reality
and
is
especially
timely
due
to
the
rise
in
number
of
lucid
dreamers
(
popular
manuals
on
how
to
lucid
dream
are
sold
and
actively
endorsed
by
some
leading
psychologists
;
see
laberge
&
rheingold
,
1990
;
love
,
2013
)
and
the
increase
of
virtual
realities
on
computers
.
whereas
deontologists
and
consequentialists
are
likely
to
be
more
interested
in
the
content
of
the
dreams
,
the
virtue
ethicist
will
likely
be
more
interested
in
dreaming
as
an
overall
activity
and
how
it
fits
in
with
one



s
life
.
stephen
laberge
is
perhaps
an
implicit
virtue
ethicist
of
dreaming
.
though
humans
are
thought
to
be
moral
agents
,
we
spend
a
third
of
our
lives
asleep
.
11%
of
our
mental
experiences
are
dreams
(
love
,
2013
:
p
.
2
)
.
the
dreams
we
experience
during
sleep
are
mostly
non-agentic
and
this
amounts
to
a
significant
unfulfilled
portion
of
our
lives
.
laberge
argues
that
by
not
cultivating
lucid
dreams
,
we
miss
out
on
opportunities
to
explore
our
own
minds
and
ultimately
enrich
our
waking
lives
(
laberge
&
rheingold
,
1990
:
p

)
.
arguably
then
,
the
fulfilled
virtuous
person
will
try
to
develop
the
skill
of
lucid
dreaming
.
one
could
object
that
the
dreamer
should
just
get
on
with
life
in
the
real
world
.
after
all
,
learning
to
lucid
dream
for
most
people
takes
time
and
practice
,
requiring
the
individual
to
think
about
their
dreams
for
periods
of
time
in
their
waking
life
.
they
could
be
spending
their
time
instead
doing
voluntary
work
for
charity
in
real
life
.
in
reply
,
the
virtue
ethicist
can
show
how
parallel
arguments
can
be
made
for
meditation
:
individuals
are
calmer
in
situations
that
threaten
their
morality
and
are
working
on
longer-term
habits
.

similarly
,
the
lucid
dreamer
is
achieving
fulfilment
and
nurturing
important
long
term
traits
and
habits
.
by
gaining
control
of
dreams
,
there
is
the
opportunity
to
examine
relationships
with
people
by
representing
them
in
dreams
.
lucid
dreams
might
aid
in
getting
an
individual
to
carry
out
a
difficult
task
in
real
life
by
allowing
them
to
practice
it
in
life-like
settings
(
that
go
beyond
merely
imagining
the
scenario
in
waking
life
)
.
lucid
dreams
may
then
help
to
play
a
role
in
developing
traits
that
people
otherwise
would
not
develop
,
and
act
as
an
outlet
for
encouraging
the


thick
moral
concepts



of
oneself



courage
,
bravery
,
wisdom
,
and
so
forth
.
lucid
dreaming
helps
in
developing
such
traits
and
so
can
be
seen
as
a
means
to
the
end
of
virtuousness
or
act
as
a
supplementary
virtue
.
human
experience
can
be
taken
as
any
area
in
which
a
choice
is
required
.
at
the
very
least
then
,
lucid
dreaming
signifies
an
expansion
of
agency
.

a
.
the
received
view
of
dreaming
there
is
an
implicit
,
unquestioned
commitment
in
both
descartes



dream
argument
and
augustine



s
argument
on
the
morality
of
dreaming
.
this
is
the
received
view
,
which
is
the
platitudinous
claim
that
a
dream
is
a
sequence
of
experiences
that
occur
during
sleep
.
the
received
view
typically
adheres
to
a
number
of
further
claims
:
that
dreams
play
out
approximately
in
real
time
and
do
not
happen
in
a
flash
.
when
a
dream
is
successfully
remembered
,
the
content
of
the
dream
is
to
a
large
extent
what
is
remembered
after
waking
(
see
fig
.
1
below
)
,
and
an
individual



s
dream
report
is
taken
as
excellent
evidence
for
that
dream
having
taken
place
.

fig
1
the
received
view
is
committed
to
the
claim
that
we
do
not
wake
up
with
misleading
memories
.
any
failure
of
memory
is
of
omission
rather
than
error
.
i
might
wake
unable
to
recall
the
exact
details
of
certain
parts
of
a
dream
,
but
i
will
not
wake
up
and
believe
i
had
a
dream
involving
contents
which
did
not
occur
(

recall
details
a



g
with
d
missing
,
but
i
will
not

)
.
the
received
view
is
not
committed
to
a
claim
about
exactly
how
long
a
dream
takes
to
experience
,
in
correlation
to
how
long
it
takes
to
remember
,
but
dreams
cannot
occur
instantaneously
during
sleep
.
the
received
view
is
committed
to
the
claim
that
dreams
are
extended
in
time
during
sleep
.

the
content
does
not
necessarily
have
to
occur
just
before
waking
;
another
graph
detailing
possible
experience
and
later
recollection
of
dream
content
on
the
received
view
might
show
a



g
occurring
much
earlier
in
sleep
(
with
the
recalled
a*



g*
in
the
same
place
)
.
a



g
can
represent
any
dream
that
people
ordinarily
recall
we
can
appear
to
carry
out
a
scope
of
actions
in
our
dreams
pretty
similar
to
those
of
waking
life
.
everything
that
we
can
do
in
waking
life
,
we
can
also
do
in
dreams
.
the
exact
same
mental
states
can
occur
in
dreams
just
as
they
do
in
waking
life
.
we
can
believe
,
judge
,
reason
and
converse
with
what
we
take
to
be
other
individuals
in
our
dreams
.

since
we
can
be
frightened
in
a
dream
we
can
be
frightened
during
sleep
.

the
received
view
is
attested
by
reports
of
dreams
from
ordinary
people
in
laboratory
and
everyday
settings
.
every
dreamer
portrays
the
dream
as
a
mental
experience
that
occurred
during
sleep
.
the
received
view
is
hence
a
part
of
folk
psychology
which
is
the
term
given
to
denote
the
beliefs
that
ordinary
people
hold
on
matters
concerning
psychology
such
as
the
nature
of
mental
states
.
when
it
comes
to
dreaming
,
the
consensus
(
folk
psychology
,
scientific
psychology
and
philosophy
)
agree
that
dreams
are
experiences
that
occur
during
sleep
.

malcolm



s
challenge
to
the
received
view
malcolm
stands
in
opposition
to
received
view



the
implicit
set
of
claims
about
dreams
that
descartes
,
augustine
and
the
majority
of
philosophers
,
psychologists
and
ordinary
people
are
committed
to
.
it
will
be
worth
separating
malcolm



s
challenge
to
the
received
view
into
three
arguments
:
#1
dream
reports
are
unverifiable
;
#2
sleep
and
dreaming
have
conflicting
definitions
;
#3
communication
and
judgements
cannot
occur
during
sleep
.

i
.
the
impossibility
of
verifying
dream
reports
according
to
malcolm



s
first
argument
,
we
should
not
simply
take
dream
reports
at
face
value
,
as
the
received
view
has
done
;
dream
reports
are
insufficient
to
believe
the
metaphysical
claim
that
dreaming
consciously
takes
place
during
sleep
.
when
we
use
introspection
after
sleeping
to
examine
our
episodic
memories
of
dreams
and
put
our
dream
report
into
words
,
these
are
not
the
dream
experiences
themselves
.

malcolm
adds
that
there
is
no
other
way
to
check
the
received
view



s
primary
claim
that
dreams
are
consciously
experienced
during
sleep
.

importantly
,
malcolm
states
that
the
sole
criterion
we
have
for
establishing
that
one
has
had
a
dream
is
that
one
awakes
with
the
impression
of
having
dreamt
(
that
is
,
an
apparent
memory
)
and
that
one
then
goes
on
to
report
the
dream
.
waking
with
the
impression
does
not
entail
that
there
was
a
conscious
experience
during
sleep
that
actually
corresponds
to
the
report
.
malcolm
views
dream
reports
as
inherently
first
personal
and
repeatedly
claims
that
the
verbal
report
of
a
dream
is
the
only
criterion
for
believing
that
a
dream
took
place
.
he
adds
that
dreams
cannot
be
checked
in
any
other
way
without
either
showing
that
the
individual
is
not
fully
asleep
or
by
invoking
a
new
conception
of
dreaming
by
relying
on
behavioural
criteria
such
as
patterns
of
physiology
or
movement
during
sleep
.
behavioral
criteria
too
,
are
insufficient
to
confirm
that
an
individual
is
consciously
experiencing
their
dreams
,
according
to
malcolm
.
the
best
we
can
get
from
that
are
probabilistic
indications
of
consciousness
that
will
never
be
decisive
.

if
scientists
try
to
show
that
one
is
dreaming
during
sleep
then
those
scientists
have
invoked
a
new
conception
of
dreaming
that
does
not
resemble
the
old
one
,
malcolm
alleges
.
he
believes
that
where
scientists
appeal
to
behavioural
criteria
they
are
no
longer
inquiring
into
dreaming
because
the
real
conception
of
dreaming
has
only
ever
relied
on
dream
reports
.
a
dream
is
logically
inseparable
from
the
dream
report
and
it
cannot
be
assumed
that
the
report
refers
to
an
experience
during
sleep
.
malcolm
thereby
undermines
the
received
view



s
claim
that


i
dreamed
that
i
was
flying



entails
that
i
had
an
experience
during
sleep
in
which
i
believed
i
was
flying
.
hence
there
is
no
way
of
conclusively
confirming
the
idea
that
dreaming
occurs
during
sleep
at
all
.

malcolm



s
claim
that
the
received
view
is
unverifiable
is
inspired
by
a
statement
made
by
wittgenstein
who
alludes
to
the
possibility
that
there
is
no
way
of
finding
out
if
the
memory
of
a
dream
corresponds
to
the
dream
as
it
actually
occurred
(
wittgenstein
,
1953
:
part
2
,
§
vii
;
p
.
415
)
.
wittgenstein
asks
us
what
we
should
do
about
a
man
who
has
an
especially
bad
memory
.
how
can
we
trust
his
reports
of
dreams
?
the
received
view
is
committed
to
a
crucial
premise
that
when
we
recall
dreams
we
recall
the
same
content
of
the
earlier
experience
.
but
wittgenstein



s
scenario
establishes
the
possibility
that
an
individual
could
recall
content
that
did
not
occur
.
the
question
then
arises
as
to
why
we
should
believe
that
somebody
with
even
a
good
day-to-day
memory
is
in
any
better
position
to
remember
earlier
conscious
experiences
during
sleep
after
waking
.

in
drawing
attention
to
empirical
work
on
dreams
,
malcolm
says
that
psychologists
have
come
to
be
uncertain
whether
dreams
occur
during
sleep
or
during
the
moment
of
waking
up
.
the
point
for
malcolm
is
that
it
is


impossible
to
decide



between
the
two
(
malcolm
,
1956
:
p
.
29
)
.

hence
the
question


when
,
in
his
sleep
,
did
he
dream
?



is
senseless
.

there
is
also
a
lack
of
criterion
for
the
duration
of
dreams
,
that
is
how
long
they
last
in
real
time
.
malcolm
states
that
the
concept
of
the
time
of
occurrence
of
a
dream
and
also
how
long
a
dream
might
last
has
no
application
in
ordinary
conversation
about
dreams
.


in
this
sense
,
a
dream
is
not
an


occurrence



and
,
therefore
,
not
an
occurrence
during
sleep



(
malcolm
:
1956
,
p
.
30
)
.
malcolm



s
epistemic
claim
has
a
metaphysical
result
,
namely
,
that
dreaming
does
not
take
place
in
time
or
space
.
the
combination
of
the
waking
impression
and
the
use
of
language
has
misled
us
into
believing
that
dreams
occur
during
sleep
;


dreams



do
not
refer
to
anything
over
and
above
the
waking
report
,
according
to
malcolm
.
this
is
why
malcolm
thinks
that
the
notion
of


dreaming



is
an
exemplar
of
wittgenstein



s
idea
of
prejudices


produced
by


grammatical
illusions






(
malcolm
,
1959
:
p
.
75
)
.

ii
.
the
conflicting
definitions
of


sleep



and


dreaming



according
to
malcolm



s
second
argument
,
he
accuses
the
received
view
of
contradicting
itself
and
so
the
claim
that
dreams
could
consciously
occur
during
sleep
is
incoherent
.
sleep
is
supposed
to
entail
a
lack
of
experiential
content
,
or
at
least
an
absence
of
intended
behaviour
,
whereas
dreaming
is
said
to
involve
conscious
experience
.
experience
implies
consciousness
;
sleep
implies
a
lack
of
consciousness
;
therefore
the
claim
that
dreams
could
occur
during
sleep
implies
consciousness
and
a
lack
of
consciousness
.
so
the
received
view
results
in
a
contradiction
.
this
alleged
contradiction
of
sleep
and
dreaming
supports
malcolm



s
first
argument
that
dreams
are
unverifiable
because
any
attempt
to
verify
the
dream
report
will
just
show
that
the
individual
was
not
asleep
and
so
there
is
no
way
to
verify
that
dreams
could
possibly
occur
during
sleep
.
one
might
object
to
malcolm
that
the
content
of
a
dream
report
could
coincide
well
with
a
publicly
verifiable
event
,
such
as
the
occurrence
of
thunder
while
the
individual
slept
and
thunder
in
the
reported
dream
later
.
malcolm
claims
that
in
this
instance
the
individual
could
not
be
sound
asleep
if
they
are
aware
of
their
environment
in
any
way
.
he
alleges
that
instances
such
as
nightmares
and
sleepwalking
also
invoke
new
conceptions
of
sleep
and
dreaming
.
by


sleep



malcolm
thinks
that
people
have
meant
sound
sleep
as
the
paradigmatic
example
,
namelessly
,
sleeping
whilst
showing
no
awareness
of
the
outside
environment
and
no
behaviour
.

iii
.
the
impossibility
of
communicating
or
making
judgments
during
sleep
malcolm
takes
communication
as
a
crucial
way
of
verifying
that
a
mental
state
could
be
experienced
.
his
third
argument
rules
out
the
possibility
of
individuals
communicating
or
making
judgements
during
sleep
,
essentially
closing
off
dreams
as
things
we
can
know
anything
about
.
this
third
argument
supports
the
first
argument
that
dreams
are
unverifiable
and
anticipates
a
counter-claim
that
individuals
might
be
able
to
report
a
dream
as
it
occurs
,
thereby
verifying
it
as
a
conscious
experience
.
malcolm
claims
that
a
person
cannot
say
and
be
aware
of
saying
the
statement


i
am
asleep



without
it
being
false
.
it
is
true
that
somebody
could
talk
in
his
sleep
and
incidentally
say


i
am
asleep



but
he
could
not
assert
that
he
is
asleep
.
if
he
is
actually
asleep
then
he
is
not
aware
of
saying
the
statement
(
and
so
it
is
not
an
assertion
)
,
whilst
if
he
is
aware
of
saying
the
statement
then
he
is
not
asleep
.
since
a
sleeping
individual
cannot
meaningfully
assert
that
he
is
asleep
,
malcolm
concludes
that
communication
between
a
sleeping
individual
and
individuals
who
are
awake
is
logically
impossible
.

as
inherently
first
personal
and
retrospective
reports
,
or
so
malcolm
alleges
,
the
dream
report
fails
wittgensteinian
criteria
of
being
potentially
verified
as
experiences
.
malcolm
alleges
that
there
could
be
no
intelligible
mental
state
that
could
occur
during
sleep
;
any
talk
about
mental
states
that
could
occur
during
sleep
is
meaningless
.

malcolm
assumes
the
wittgensteinian
point
that
talk
about
experiences
gain
meaning
in
virtue
of
their
communicability
.
communicability
is
necessary
for
the
meaningfulness
of
folk
psychological
terms
.
malcolm
appeals
to
the


no
private
language
argument



to
rebut
the
idea
that
there
could
be
a
mental
state
which
only
one
individual
could
privately
experience
and
understand
(
for
more
on
the
private
language
argument
,
see
candlish
&
wrisley
,
2012
)
.

the
claim
that
there
is
a
lack
of
possible
communicability
in
sleep
is
key
for
malcolm
to
cash
out
the
further
claim
that
one
cannot
make
judgements
during
sleep
.
he
does
not
believe
that
one
could
judge
what
they
cannot
communicate
.
according
to
malcolm
,
since
people
cannot
communicate
during
sleep
,
they
cannot
make
judgements
during
sleep
.
he
further
adds
that
being
unable
to
judge
that
one
is
asleep
underlies
the
impossibility
of
being
unable
to
have
any
mental
experience
during
sleep
.
for
,
we
could
never
observe
an
individual
judge
that
he
was
asleep
.
this
point
relies
on
malcolm



s
second
argument
that
the
definitions
of
sleep
and
dreaming
are
in
contradiction
.
there
is
nothing
an
individual
could
do
to
demonstrate
he
was
making
a
judgement
that
did
not
also
simultaneously
show
that
he
was
awake
.
of
course
,
it
seems
possible
that
we
could
have
an
inner
experience
that
we
did
not
communicate
to
others
.
malcolm
points
out
that
individuals
in
everyday
waking
instances
could
have
communicated
their
experiences
,
at
least
modally
.
there
is
no
possible
world
though
,
in
which
a
sleeping
individual
could
communicate
with
us
his
experience



so
one
cannot
judge
that
one
is
asleep
and
dreaming
.
if
malcolm



s
argument
about
the
impossibility
of
making
judgements
in
sleep
works
then
his
attack
is
detrimental
to
the
received
view



s
premise
that
in
sleep
we
can
judge
,
reason
,
and
so
forth
.

iv
.
ramifications
(
contra
descartes
)
malcolm
thinks
that
his
challenge
to
the
received
view
,
if
successful
,
undercuts
cartesian
scepticism
descartes



scepticism
got
off
the
ground
when
he
raised
the
following
issue
:
due
to
the
similarity
of
dreams
and
waking
experiences
,
my
apparent
waking
experience
might
be
a
dream
now
and
much
of
what
i
took
to
be
knowledge
is
potentially
untrue
.
a
key
premise
for
descartes
is
that
a
dream
is
a
sequence
of
experiences
,
the
very
same
kind
we
can
have
whilst
awake
.
this
premise
is
undermined
if
dreams
are
not
experiences
at
all
.
if
the
received
view
is
unintelligible
then
descartes
cannot
coherently
compare
waking
life
experiences
to
dreams
:


if
one
cannot
have
thoughts
while
sound
asleep
,
one
cannot
be
deceived
while
sound
asleep



(

.

descartes
,
championing
the
received
view
,
failed
to
notice
the
incoherence
in
the
notion
that
we
can
be
asleep
and
aware
of
anything
.

whenever
we
are
aware
of
anything
,
whether
it
be
the
fire
in
front
of
us
or
otherwise
,
this
is
firm
evidence
that
we
are
awake
and
that
the
world
presented
to
us
is
as
it
really
is
.

possible
objections
to

i
.
putnam
on
the
conceptual
analysis
of
dreaming
part
of
malcolm



s
challenge
to
empirical
work
was
his
claim
that
the
researchers
have
invoked
new
conceptions
of
sleep
and
dreaming
(
without
realizing
it
)
because
of
the
new
method
of
attempted
verification
.

according
to
malcolm



s
charge
,
researchers
are
not
really
looking
into
dreaming
as
the
received
view
understands
the
concept
of
dreaming
.
this
was
crucial
for
his
attempt
to
undermine
all
empirical
work
on
dreaming
.
instead
of
relying
on
an
individual



s
waking
report
scientists
may
now
try
to
infer
from
rapid
eye
movements
or
other
physiological
criteria
that
the
individual
is
asleep
and
dreaming
.
for
malcolm
,
these
scientists
are
working
from
a
new
conception
of


sleep



and


dreaming



which
only
resembles
the
old
one
.
putnam
objects
to
malcolm



s
claim
,
stating
that
science
updates
our
concepts
and
does
not
replace
them
:
the
received
view
seeks
confirmation
in
empirical
work
.

in
general
,
concepts
are
always
being
updated
by
new
empirical
knowledge
.
putnam
cites
the
example
of
multiple
sclerosis
(
ms
)
,
a
disease
which
is
made
very
difficult
to
diagnose
because
the
symptoms
resemble
those
of
other
neurological
diseases
and
not
all
of
the
symptoms
are
usually
present
.
furthermore
,
some
neurologists
have
come
to
believe
that
ms
is
caused
by
a
certain
virus
.
suppose
a
patient
has
a
paradigmatic
case
of
ms
.
saying
that
the
virus
is
the
cause
of
the
disease
changes
the
concept
because
it
involves
new
knowledge
.
on
malcolm



s
general
account
,
it
would
be
a
new
understanding
with
a
new
concept
and
so
the
scientists
would
not
be
talking
about
ms
at
all
(
putnam
,
1962
:
p
.
219
)
.
putnam
believes
that
we
should
reject
malcolm



s
view
that
future
scientists
are
talking
about
a
different
disease
.

analogously
,
we
are
still
talking
about
the
same
thing
when
we
talk
about
new
ways
of
verifying
the
existence
of
dreams
.
if
putnam



s
attack
is
successful
then
the
work
that
scientists
are
doing
on
dreaming
is
about
dreaming
as
the
received
view
understands
the
concept
,
namely
,
conscious
experiences
that
occur
during
sleep
.
if
putnam
is
right
that
scientists
are
not
invoking
a
new
conception
of
sleep
and
dreaming
,
then
we
can
find
other
ways
to
verify
our
understanding
of
dreaming
and
the
received
view
is
continuous
with
empirical
work
.

distinguishing


state



and


creature



consciousness
david
rosenthal
develops
some
conceptual
vocabulary
(
rosenthal
:
2002
,
p
.
406
)
,
which
arguably
exposes
a
flaw
in
malcolm



s
reasoning
.


creature
consciousness



is
what
any
individual
or
animal
displays
when
awake
and
responsive
to
external
stimuli
.


creature
unconsciousness



is
what
the
individual
or
animal
displays
when
unresponsive
to
external
stimuli
.



state
consciousness
,



on
the
other
hand
,
refers
to
the
mental
state
that
occurs
when
one
has
an
experience
.
this
may
be
either
internally
or
externally
driven
.
i
may
have
a
perception
of
my
environment
or
an
imaginative
idea
without
perceptual
input
.
malcolm
evidently
thinks
that
any
form
of
state
consciousness
requires
some
degree
of
creature
consciousness
.
but
such
a
belief
begs
the
question
,
so
a
rosenthalian
opponent
of
malcolm
might
argue
.
it
does
not
seem
to
be
conceptually
confused
to
believe
that
one
can
be
responsive
to
internal
stimuli
(
hence
state
conscious
)
without
being
responsive
to
external
stimuli
(
hence
creature
unconscious
)
.
if
,
by


sleep



all
we
have
meant
is
creature
unconsciousness
,
then
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
an
individual
cannot
have
state
conscious
at
the
same
time
.
an
individual
can
be
creature
unconscious
whilst
having
state
consciousness
,
that
is
to
say
,
an
individual
can
be
asleep
and
dreaming
.

there
are
various
reasons
to
believe
that
creature
consciousness
and
state
consciousness
can
come
apart
(
and
that
state
consciousness
can
plausibly
occur
without
creature
consciousness
)
:
the
mental
experience
of
dreaming
can
be
gripping
and
the
individual



s
critical
reasoning
poor
enough
to
be
deceived
into
believing
his
dream
is
reality
;
most
movement
in
sleep
is
not
a
response
to
outside
stimuli
at
all
but
rather
a
response
to
internal
phenomenology
;
the
sleeping
individual
is
never
directly
aware
of
his
own
body
during
sleep
.
recall
that
malcolm
thought
that
sleep
scientists
cannot
correlate
movement
in
sleep
with
a
later
dream
report
because
it
detracted
from
their
being
fully
asleep
because
creature
consciousness
and
state
consciousness
can
coexist
.

malcolm
is
arguably
wrong
,
then
,
to
think
that
an
individual
moving
in
sleep
detracts
from
their
being
fully
asleep
.
this
may
block
malcolm



s
appeal
to
sound
sleep
as
the
paradigmatic
example
of
sleep
.
with
the
rosenthalian
distinction
,
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
even
if
an
individual
moves
around
in
sleep
,
they
are
just
as
asleep
as
a
sleeping
individual
lying
completely
still
.
the
distinction
may
also
count
against
malcolm



s
third
argument
against
the
possibility
of
communication
in
sleep
.
of
course
,
if
creature
consciousness
is
a
necessary
condition
for
communication
then
this
distinction
is
not
enough
to
undermine
malcolm



s
third
argument
that
communication
cannot
occur
during
sleep
.
a
view
where
state
consciousness
alone
suffices
for
communication
will
survive
malcolm



s
third
argument
,
on
the
other
hand
.

the
apparent
contradiction
in
sleep
and
dreaming
that
malcolm
claims
existed
will
be
avoided
if
the
kind
of
consciousness
implied
by
sleep
is
different
to
the
kind
malcolm
thinks
is
implied
.
the
distinction
might
allow
us
to
conclude
that
corroboration
between
a
waking
report
and
a
publically
verifiable
sound
,
for
example
,
can
demonstrate
that
an
individual
is
dreaming
and
yet
asleep
.
some
dream
content
,
as
reported
afterwards
,
seems
to
incorporate
external
stimuli
that
occurred
at
the
same
time
as
the
dream
.
malcolm
calls
this
faint
perception
(
malcolm
,
1956
:
p
.
22
)
of
the
environment
and
says
that
it
detracts
from
an
individual



s
being
fully
asleep
.
perhaps
an
objector
to
malcolm
can
make
a
further
,
albeit
controversial
claim
,
in
the
rosenthalian
framework
,
to
account
for
such
dreams
.
for
example
,
if
there
is
thunder
outside
and
an
individual
is
asleep
he
might
dream
of
being
struck
by
thor



s
hammer
.
his
experience
of
the
thunder
is
not
the
same
sort
of
experience
he
would
have
had
if
he
were
awake
during
the
thunder
.
the
possible
qualia
are
different
.
so
malcolm
may
be
wrong
in
alleging
that
an
individual
is
faintly
aware
of
the
outside
environment
if
corroboration
is
attempted
between
a
report
and
a
verifiable
sound
,
for
example
.
malcolm
argued
that
such
dreams
are
examples
of
individuals
who
are
not
fully
asleep
.
but
we
can
now
see
within
the
rosenthalian
framework
how
an
individual
could
be
creature
unconscious
(
or
simply


asleep



on
the
received
view
)
and
be
taking
in
external
stimuli
unconsciously
whilst
having
state
consciousness
that
is
not
directly
responsive
to
the
external
environment
because
he
is
not
even
faintly
conscious
of
the
external
world
.

dennett



s
challenge
to
the
received
view
i
.
a
new
model
of
dreaming
:
uploading
unconscious
content
dennett
begins
his
attack
on
the
received
view
of
dreaming
(
the
set
of
claims
about
dreams
being
consciously
experienced
during
sleep
)
by
questioning
its
authority
.
he
does
this
by
proposing
a
new
model
of
dreaming
.
he
is
flexible
in
his
approach
and
considers
variations
of
his
model
.
the
crucial
difference
between
his
theory
and
the
received
view
is
that
consciousness
is
not
present
during
sleep
on
,
what
we
might
call
dennett



s
uploading
of
unconscious
content
model
of
dreaming
.
dennett
does
not
say
much
about
how
this
processing
of
unconscious
material
works
,
only
that
different
memories
are
uploaded
and
woven
together
to
create
new
content
that
will
be
recalled
upon
waking
as
though
it
was
experienced
during
sleep
,
although
it
never
was
.
dennett
is
not
repeating
malcolm



s
first
argument
that
dreaming
is
unverifiable
.
on
the
contrary
,
he
believes
that
the
issue
will
be
settled
empirically
,
though
he
claims
that
there
is
nothing
to
favour
the
received
view



s
own
claim
that
dreams
involve
conscious
experiences
.

on
the
received
view
,
the
memory
of
an
earlier
dream
is
caused
by
the
earlier
dream
experience
and
is
the
second
time
the
content
is
experienced
.
on
dennett



s
model
,
dream
recall
is
the
first
time
the
content
is
experienced
.
why
believe
that
dreaming
involves
a
lack
of
consciousness
during
sleep
?
one
might
cite
evidence
that
the
directions
of
rapid
eye
movements
during
sleep
have
been
well
correlated
with
the
reports
of
dream
content
.
an
individual
with
predominantly
horizontal
eye
movements
might
wake
up
and
report
that
they
were
watching
a
tennis
match
in
their
dream
.
dennett
accommodates
these
(
at
the
time
)
unconfirmed
findings
by
arguing
that
even
if
it
is
the
case
that
eye
movement
matches
perfectly
with
the
reported
content
,
the
unconscious
is
uploading
memories
and
readying
the
content
that
will
be
experienced
in
the
form
of
a
false
memory
.
the
memory
loading
process
is
not
conscious
at
the
time
of
occurrence
.
such
findings
would
almost
return
us
back
to
the
received
view



that
the
content
of
the
dream
does
occur
during
sleep
.
it
may
be
that
the
unconscious
content
is
uploaded
sequentially
in
the
same
order
as
the
received
view
believes
.
we
do
not
have
proof
that
the
individual
is
aware
of
the
content
of
the
dream
during
sleep
.
that
is
to
say
,
the
individual
may
not
be
having
a
conscious
experience
,
even
though
the
brain
process
involves
the
scenario
which
will
be
consciously
experienced
later
,
as
though
it
was
consciously
experienced
during
sleep
.
movement
and
apparent
emotion
in
sleep
can
be
accounted
for
too
;
a
person
twitches
in
their
sleep
as
a
memory
with
content
involving
a
frightening
scenario
is
uploaded
and
interwoven
into
a
nightmarish
narrative
.
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
the
individual
is
conscious
of
this
content
being
uploaded
.
this
account
is
even
plausible
on
an
evolutionary
account
of
sleep
.
the
mind
needs
time
to
be
unconscious
and
the
brain
and
body
needs
to
recalibrate
.
thus
,
during
sleep
,
the
body
is
like
a
puppet
,
its
strings
being
pulled
by
the
memory
loading
process



although
individuals
show
outward
sign
of
emotion
and
bodily
movement
,
there
is
nothing
going
on
inside
.
sometimes
,
though
,
what
is
remembered
is
the
content
being
prepared
,
similar
to
the
received
view
,
only
the
individual
is
not
aware
of
the
content
during
sleep



this
is
why
there
can
be
matches
between
dream
content
reported
and
the
direction
of
eye
movement
.
both
sides
of
the
debate
agree
that
when
dream
content
is
being
prepared
some
parts
of
the
body
move
about
as
though
it
was
a
conscious
experience
,
only
dennett
denies
that
consciousness
is
present
at
the
time
and
the
received
view
believes
that
it
is
present
.

dennett
also
considers
possibilities
where
the
content
of
dream
recall
does
not
match
the
content
that
is
uploaded
.
the
content
of
the
uploading
during
sleep
might
involve
,
say
,
window
shopping
in
a
local
mall
,
yet
the
content
that
is
recalled
upon
waking
might
recall
flying
over
paris
.
having
outlined
the
two
theories



the
received
view
and
his
own
unconscious
alternative



dennett
is
merely
making
a
sceptical
point
that
the
data
of
dream
reports
alone
will
not
decide
between
them
.
what
is
to
choose
between
them
?
dennett
believes
that
there
is
further
evidence
of
a
specific
type
of
dream
report
that
might
decide
the
issue
in
favour
of
his
own
model
.

ii
.
accounting
for
new
data
on
dreams
:


precognitive



dreams
any
scientific
theory
must
be
able
to
account
for
all
of
the
data
.

dennett
believes
that
there
exists
certain
dream
reports
which
the
received
view
has
failed
to
acknowledge
and
cannot
account
for
.
there
exists
anecdotal
evidence
that
seems
to
suggest
that
dreams
are
concocted
at
the
moment
of
waking
,
rather
than
experienced
during
sleep
and
is
therefore
a
direct
challenge
to
the
received
view
.
the
most
well-known
anecdotal
example
was
noted
by
french
physicist
alfred
maury
,
who
dreamt
for
some
time
of
taking
part
in
the
french
revolution
,
before
being
forcibly
taken
to
the
guillotine
.
as
his
head
was
about
to
be
cut
off
in
the
dream
,
he
woke
up
with
the
headboard
falling
on
his
neck
(
freud
,
1900
:
chapter
1
;
blackmore
,
2005
:
p
.
103
)
.

this
anecdotal
type
of
dream
is
well
documented
in
films



one
dreams
of
taking
a
long
romantic
vacation
with
a
significant
other
,
about
to
kiss
them
,
only
to
wake
up
with
the
dog
licking
their
face
.
in
dennett



s
own
anecdotal
example
,
he
recalls
dreaming
for
some
time
of
looking
for
his
neighbour



s
goat
.
eventually
,
the
goat
started
bleating
at
the
same
time
as
his
alarm
clock
went
off
which
then
woke
him
up
(
dennett
:
1976
,
p
.
157
)
.
the
received
view
is
committed
to
the
claim
that
dreams
,
that
is
,
conscious
experiences
,
occur
whilst
an
individual
is
asleep
.
the
individual
then
awakes
with
the
preserved
memory
of
content
from
the
dream
.
but
the
anecdotes
pose
a
potentially
fatal
problem
for
the
received
view
because
the
entire
content
of
the
dream
seems
to
be
caused
by
the
stimulus
that
woke
the
individual
up
.
the
anecdotes
make
dreams
look
more
like
spontaneous
imaginings
on
waking
than
the
real
time
conscious
experiences
of
the
received
view
.
dennett
argues
that
precognition
is
the
only
defense
the
received
view
can
take
against
this
implication
.
given
the
paranormal
connotations
,
this
defense
is
redundant
(
dennett
:
1976
,
p
.
158
)
.
dennett
provides
a
number
of
other
anecdotal
examples
that
imply
that
the
narrative
to
dreams
is
triggered
retrospectively
,
after
waking
.
the
content
of
the
dream
thematically
and
logically
leads
up
to
the
end
point
,
which
is
too
similar
to
the
waking
stimulus
to
be
a
coincidence
.
the
difficulty
for
the
received
view
is
to
explain
how
the
content
could
be
working
towards
simultaneously
ending
with
the
sound
,
or
equivalent
experience
,
of
something
in
the
outside
environment
.

if
dennett
is
right
that
the
received
view
can
only
explain
the
anecdotes
by
appeal
to
precognition
then
we
would
do
well
to
adopt
a
more
plausible
account
of
dreaming
.
any
attempt
to
suggest
that
individuals
have
premonitions
about
the
near
future
from
dreams
would
have
little
credibility
.
dennett



s
alternative
unconscious
uploading
account
might
also
allow
for
the
retro-selection
of
appropriate
content
on
the
moment
of
waking
.
this
theory
allows
for
two
ways
of
dreaming
to
regularly
occur
,
both
without
conscious
experience
during
sleep
.
the
first
way
:
dreams
play
out
similar
to
the
received
view
,
only
individuals
lack
consciousness
of
the
content
during
sleep
.

specifically
,
dennett
argues
that
during
sleep
different
memories
are
uploaded
by
the
unconscious
and
woven
together
to
create
the
dream
content
that
will
eventually
be
experienced
when
the
individual
wakes
.

during
sleep
the
content
of
the
dream
is
gathered
together
by
the
brain
,
without
conscious
awareness
,
like
recording
a
programme
at
night
which
is
consciously
played
for
the
first
time
in
waking
moments
.
the
second
way
:
perhaps
when
one
is
woken
up
dramatically
,
the
brain
selects
material
(
relevant
to
the
nature
of
the
waking
stimulus
)
at
the
moment
of
waking
which
is
threaded
together
as
a
new
story
,
causing
the
individual
to
have
a


hallucination
of
recollection



(
dennett
,
1976
:
p
.
169
)
.
it
might
be
that
the
unconscious
was
preparing
entirely
different
content
during
sleep
,
which
was
set
to
be
recalled
,
but
that
content
is
overwritten
due
to
the
dramatic
interruption
.

on
dennett



s
unconscious
uploading/retro-selection
theory
,


it
is
not
like
anything
to
dream
,
although
it
is
like
something
to
have
dreamed



(
dennett
,
1976
:
p
.
161
)
.
consciousness
is
invoked
on
waking
as
one
apparently
remembers
an
event
which
had
never
consciously
occurred
before
.
on
the
above
proposal
,
dennett
was
not
experiencing
a



g
,
nor
was
the
content
for
that
dream
even
being
prepared
(
though
it
might
have
been
material
prepared
at
an
earlier
date
and
selected
now
)
.

dennett
also
alludes
to
a
library
in
the
brain
of
undreamed
dreams
with
various
endings
that
are
selected
in
the
moments
of
waking
to
appropriately
fit
the
narrative
connotations
of
the
stimuli
that
wakes
the
individual
(
dennett
,
1976
:
p
.
158
)
.
his
account
is
open
to
include
variations
of
his
model
:
perhaps
various
different
endings
might
be
selected



instead
of
a
goat
,
other
content
may
have
competed
for
uploading
through
association



it
may
have
been
a
dream
involving
going
to
the
barbers
and
getting
a
haircut
,
before
the
buzzing
of
the
clippers
coincided
with
the
alarm
clock
,
or
boarding
a
spaceship
before
it
took
off
,
had
the
sound
of
the
alarm
clock
been
more
readily
associated
with
these
themes
.
alternatively
,
the
same
ending
might
get
fixed
with
alternative
story-lines
leading
up
to
that
ending
.
dennett
could
have
had
a
dream
about
going
to
his
local
job
centre
and
being
employed
as
a
farmer
,
rather
than
searching
for
his
neighbour



s
goat
,
though
the
same
ending
of
finding
a
bleating
goat
will
stay
in
place
.

as
dennett
notes
,
if
any
of
these
possibilities
turn
out
to
be
true
then
the
received
view
is
false
and
so
they
are
serious
rivals
indeed
.

for
all
the
evidence
we
have
(
in
1976
)
,
dennett
believes
his
unconscious
uploading
model
is
better
placed
to
explain
the
data
than
the
received
view
because
the
anecdotes
prove
that
sometimes
the
conscious
experience
only
occurs
after
sleep



an
alien
idea
to
the
received
view
.
moreover
,
the
received
view
should
have
no
immediate
advantage
over
the
other
models
.
dennett
separates
the
memory
from
the
experience



the
memory
of
a
dream
is
first
experienced
consciously
when
it
is
recalled
.
the
result
is
the
same
as
malcolm



s



the
received
view
is
epistemologically
and
metaphysically
flawed
.
if
there
is
nothing
it
is
like
to
have
a
dream
during
sleep
,
then
the
recall
of
dreams
does
not
refer
to
any
experience
that
occurred
during
sleep
.

e
.
possible
objections
to
dennett
i
.
lucid
dreaming
it
might
seem
that
lucid
dreaming
is
an
immediate
objection
to
malcolm
and
dennett



s
arguments
against
the
received
view
.
lucid
dreaming
occurs
when
an
individual
is
aware
during
a
dream
that
it
is
a
dream
.

lucid
dreaming
is
therefore
an
example
of
experiencing
a
dream
whilst
one
is
asleep
,
therefore
dreams
must
be
experiences
that
occur
during
sleep
.
in
replying
to
this
objection
,
dennett
argues
that
lucid
dreaming
does
not
really
occur
.
for
,
the
waking
impression
might
contain


the
literary
conceit
of
a
dream
within
a
dream



(
dennett
:
1976
,
p
.
161
)
.
the
recalled
dream
might
just
have
content
where
it
seems
as
though
the
individual
is
aware
they
are
having
a
dream
.
even
this
content
might
have
been
uploaded
unconsciously
during
sleep
.
it
might
now
seem
that
we
have
no
obvious
way
of
testing
that
the
individual
who
reports
having
had
a
lucid
dream
is
aware
of
the
dream
at
the
time
.

dennett



s
reply
is
undermined
by
a
series
of
experiments
carried
out
by
stephen
laberge
.
laberge
asked
individuals
who
could
lucid
dream
to
voluntarily
communicate
with
him
in
their
lucid
dreams
by
using
the
match
in
content
of
the
dream
to
the
direction
of
eye
movements
,
thereby
challenging
dennett



s
claim
that
individuals
are
not
conscious
during
sleep
.
the
participants
made
pre-arranged
and
agreed
eye
movements
.
one
might
think
that
if
lucid
dreaming
is
really
occurring
,
and
the
direction
of
rem
might
be
linked
to
the
content
of
the
dream
as
it
occurs
,
then
one
could
pre-arrange
some
way
of
looking
around
in
a
lucid
dream
(
that
stands
out
from
random
eye
movement
)
in
order
to
test
both
theories
.
stephen
laberge
carried
out
this
experiment
with
positive
results
(
laberge
,
1990
)
.
the
meaning
of
certain
patterns
of
intended
and
previously
arranged
eye
movement
,
for
example
,
left-right-left-right
can
be
a
sleeping
individual



s
way
of
expressing
the
fact
that
they
are
having
a
dream
and
aware
that
they
are
having
a
dream
(
see
figure
below
)
.

fig
4
in
figure
4
above
,
the
graph
correlates
with
the
reported
dream
content
.
the
participant
wakes
and
gives
a
dream
report
which
matches
the
eye
movement
.
the
participant
claims
to
have
made
five
eye
signals
as
agreed
.
the
written
report
confirms
the
eye
movements
and
the
participant
is
not
shown
any
of
the
physiological
data
until
his
report
is
given
.
he
alleges
to
have
gained
lucidity
in
the
first
eye
movement
(
1
,
lrlr
)
.
he
then
flew
about
in
his
dream
,
until
2
,
where
he
signalled
that
he
thought
he
had
awakened
(
2
,
lrx4
)
.
2
is
a
false
awakening
which
he
then
realized
and
went
on
to
signal
lucidity
once
again
in
3
.
here
,
he
made
too
many
eye
signals
and
went
on
to
correct
this
.
this
corroborates
with
the
participant



s
report
.
the
participant
accurately
signals
in
the
fifth
set
of
eye
movements
that
he
is
awake
which
coincides
with
the
other
physiological
data
that
the
participant
is
awake
(
participants
were
instructed
to
keep
their
eyes
closed
when
they
thought
they
had
awoken
)
.

the
important
implication
of
laberge



s
experiment
for
malcolm
and
dennett



s
arguments
is
that
they
can
no
longer
dismiss
the
results
of
content
matching
with
eye
movement
as
merely


apparent



or


occasional



(
as
they
took
the
content-relative-to-eye-movement
claim
at
the
time
they
wrote
)
.
predictability
is
a
hallmark
of
good
science
and
these
findings
indicate
that
sleep
science
can
achieve
such
status
.
the
content-relativity
thesis
is
confirmed
by
the
findings
because
it
is
exactly
what
that
thesis
predicts
in
laberge



s
experiment
.
the
opposing
thesis



that
eye
movement
is
not
relative
to
content
,
cannot
explain
why
the
predicted
result
occurred
.
namely
,
if
we
believe
that
eye
content
might
match
the
content
of
the
dream
(
and
that
lucid
dreaming
really
can
occur
,
contra
dennett
)
,
then
if
sleep
scientists
asked
participants
to
do
something
in
their
dream
(
upon
onset
of
lucidity
)
that
would
show
that
they
are
aware



this
is
what
we
would
expect
.

the
received
view
gains
further
confirmation
because
in
order
to
make
sense
of
the
communication
as
communication
,
one
has
to
employ
the
notion
that
the
direction
of
eye
movement
was
being
voluntarily
expressed
.
if
one
is
convinced
by
laberge



s
arguments
,
then
the
notion
of
communicating
during
sleep
undercuts
malcolm



s
privilege
of
the
dream
report
and
his
claim
that
individuals
could
never
communicate
during
sleep
.
we
can
empirically
demonstrate
,
then
,
that
the
waking
impression
and
the
dream
itself
are
logically
separable
.
we
need
an
account
of
why
a
sleeping
individual
would
be
exhibiting
such
systematic
eye
movements
in
laberge



s
experiments
.
one
reasonable
conclusion
is
that
the
participant
is
mentally
alert
(
has
state
consciousness
)
even
though
they
are
not
awake
(
are
not
displaying
creature
consciousness
)
.
the
most
important
implication
of
laberge



s
study
is
that
communication
can
arguably
occur
from
within
the
dream
without
waking
the
individual
up
in
any
way
.
this
supports
the
claim
of
the
received
view
that
we
can
be
asleep
and
yet
having
a
sequence
of
conscious
experiences
at
the
same
time
.
the
content
of
the
dream
occurs
during
sleep
because
the
content
is
matched
to
the
expected
,
systematic
eye
movement
beyond
coincidence
.
the
systematic
eye
movement
occurs
exactly
as
predicted
on
the
received
view
.
although
dennett
could
account
for
matched
content
to
eye
movement



he
could
not
account
for
what
seems
like
voluntary
communication
,
which
requires
that
an
individual
is
conscious
.
this
arguably
leaves
us
in
a
position
to
cash
out
dreaming
experience
as
verifiable
as
any
other
waking
state
.

the


content
relative
to
eye
movement



thesis
can
be
accepted
uncontroversially
.
much
dream
content
really
does
occur
during
sleep
and
this
can
be
taken
advantage
of
via
participants
communicating
and
thereby
demonstrating
conscious
awareness
.
if
laberge



s
participants
communicating
with
sleep
scientists
convinces
,
then
the
received
view
is
right
to
think
that
the
content
of
dreams
does
occur
during
sleep
and
that
the
dream
content
during
sleep
matches
the
memory
of
dream
content
.
the
findings
are
significant
insofar
as
the
participants
influenced
the
dream
content
and
thereby
influenced
eye
movement
through
an
act
of
agency
within
the
dream
.

the
most
important
potential
implication
of
laberge



s
findings
,
though
the
more
controversial
implication
,
is
that
communication
can
occur
from
within
the
dream
without
the
individual
waking
up
in
any
way
,
thereby
confirming
the
received
view
.
the
content
of
the
dream
occurs
during
sleep
because
the
study
confirms
that
eye
movement
during
sleep
really
does
match
up
with
the
content
of
the
dream
as
reported
after
sleep
.
laberge
chose
agreed
eye
movements
rather
than
speech
,
because
in
this
way
,
the
individual
would
remain
asleep
.
the
experiment
also
challenges
malcolm



s
claim
that
dreams
cannot
be
communicated
and
were
therefore
logically
unverifiable
.

there
exists
a
possible
objection
to
the
received
view
cashing
in
the
results
from
laberge



s
experiments
,
which
can
be
raised
in
line
with
dennett



s
unconscious
memory-loading
process
.
the
objector
might
argue
that
the
unconscious
takes
care
of
the
pending
task
of
looking
around
in
the
dream
in
the
pre-arranged
manner
.
if
,
according
to
dennett



s
retro-selection
model
,
the
unconscious
uploads
memories
from
the
day
,
then
it
follows
that
one
of
the
memories
it
might
upload
could
be
of
the
participant
discussing
with
laberge
the
specific
eye
movements
to
be
made
.
so
the
unconscious
might
carry
out
the
eye
movements
,
misleading
scientists
into
believing
the
sleeping
individual
is
conscious
.
once
we
start
to
credit
the
unconscious
with
being
able
to
negotiate
with
waking
memories
during
sleep
and
to
make
judgements
,
we
either
have
to
change
our
picture
of
the
unconscious
or
conclude
that
these
individuals
are
consciously
aware
during
sleep
.

laberge
carried
out
a
further
experiment
in
which
the
timing
of
dreams
was
measured
from
within
the
dream
.
the
experiment
used
lucid
dreamers
again
who
made
the
agreed
signal
.
they
then
counted
to
10
in
their
dream
and
then
made
the
eye
signal
again
.
they
were
also
asked
to
estimate
the
passing
of
10
seconds
without
counting
(
see
fig
.
5
below
)
.

laberge
has
concluded
from
his
experiments
that
experience
in
dreams
happens
roughly
at
the
same
time
as
in
waking
life
.
this
second
experiment
carried
out
by
laberge
further
blunts
the
dennettian
objection
from
unconsciously
uploading
the
task
.
for
,
it
seems
to
require
agency
(
rather
than
unconscious
processing
)
to
negotiate
how
much
time
is
passing
before
carrying
out
an
action
.

fig
5
there
is
still
room
for
scepticism
towards
dreams
being
consciously
experienced
during
sleep
.
for
,
the
sceptic
could
bite
the
bullet
and
say
that
lucid
dreams
are
a
special
,
anomalous
case
that
does
not
apply
to
ordinary
dreaming
.
indeed
,
there
is
evidence
that
different
parts
of
the
brain
are
accessed
,
or
more
strongly
activated
,
during
lucid
dreaming
(
pre-frontal
brain
regions
,
pre-cuneus
and
front
polar
regions
)
.
so
there
still
remains
the
possibility
that
lucid
dreaming
is
an
example
of
consciously


waking
up
within
a
dream



whilst
ordinary
dreams
are
taken
care
of
entirely
by
the
unconscious
(
thus
there
is
not
anything-it



s-like
to
have
an
ordinary
dream
occur
during
sleep
)
.
it
might
be
useful
to
look
at
one
report
of
the
memory
of
a
lucid
dream
:
in
a
dangerous
part
of
san
francisco
,
for
some
reason
i
start
crawling
on
the
sidewalk
.
i
start
to
reflect
:
this
is
strange
;
why
can



t
i
walk
?
can
other
people
walk
upright
here
?
is
it
just
me
who
has
to
crawl
?
i
see
a
man
in
a
suit
walking
under
the
streetlight
.

now
my
curiosity
is
replaced
by
fear
.
i
think
,
crawling
around
like
this
may
be
interesting
but
it
is
not
safe
.
then
i
think
,
i
never
do
this



i
always
walk
around
san
francisco
upright
!

this
only
happens
in
dreams
.
finally
,
it
dawns
on
me
:
i
must
be
dreaming
!
(

&
rheingold

notice
that
this
is
not
just
the
memory-report
of
a
lucid
dream
.

rather
,
it
is
the
memory-report
of
an
ordinary
dream
turning
into
a
lucid
dream
.
the
report
demonstrates
an
epistemic
transition
within
the
dream
.
with
this
in
mind
,
it
is
difficult
to
maintain
that
lucid
dreams
are
anomalous
,
or
that
lucid
dreams
bring
about
conscious
experience
.

for
,
there
is
a
gradual
process
of
realization
.
we
might
want
to
also
thus
accept
that
the
preceding
ordinary
dream
is
conscious
too
because
whenever
individuals
gain
lucidity
in
their
dreams
,
there
is
a
prior
process
of
gradual
realization
that
is
present
in
the
dream
report
.

when
an
individual
acquires
lucidity
in
a
dream
,
they
are
arguably
already
conscious
but
they
begin
to
think
more
critically
,
as
the
above
example
demonstrates
.
different
parts
of
the
brain
are
activated
during
lucidity
,
but
these
areas
do
not
implicate
consciousness
.
rather
,
they
are
better
correlated
to
the
individual
thinking
more
critically
.

the
gradual
transition
from
ordinary
dream
to
lucid
dream
can
be
more
fully
emphasized
.
it
is
possible
to
question
oneself
in
a
dream
whilst
failing
to
provide
the
right
answer
.
one
might
disbelieve
that
one
is
awake
and
ask
another
dream
character
to
hit
oneself
,
apparently
feel
pain
and
so
conclude
that
one
is
awake
.
it
is
important
here
to
highlight
the
existence
of
partial-lucid
dreams
in
order
to
show
that
dreams
often
involve
irrationality
and
that
there
are
fine-grained
transitions
to
the
fuller
lucidity
of
critical
thinking
in
dreams
.
a
lucid
dream
,
unlike
ordinary
dreams
,
is
defined
strictly
in
terms
of
the
advanced
epistemic
status
of
the
dreamer



the
individual
is
having
a
lucid
dream
if
they
are
aware
that
he
or
she
is
dreaming
(
green
,
1968
:

)
.
lucid
dreaming
is
defined
in
the
weak
sense
as
awareness
that
one
is
dreaming
.
defined
more
strongly
,
lucid
dreams
involve
controllability
and
a
level
of
clarity
akin
to
waking
life
.
as
stated
,
individuals
can
come
close
to
realizing
they
are
dreaming
and
miss
out



they
might
dream
about
the
nature
of
dreaming
or
lucid
dreaming
without
realizing
that
they
are
currently
in
a
dream
themselves
.
hence
the
norms
of
logical
inference
do
not
apply
to
ordinary
dreams
.
one
might
look
around
in
one



s
dream
and
think


i
must
remember
the
people
in
this
dream
for
my
dream
journal



without
inferring
that
one
is
in
a
dream
and
acquiring
lucidity
.
in
another
dream
an
individual
might
intend
to
tell
another
person
in
real
life
,
who
is
featured
in
the
dream
,
something
they
have
learned
just
as
soon
as
they
wake
up
.
in
a
dream
,
the
dreamer
could
be
accused
by
dream
character
y
of
carrying
out
an
action
a



the
dreamer
thinks


i
must
wake
up
to
tell
y
that
i
did
not
carry
out
this
action
.



implicitly
,
the
dreamer
knows
it
is
a
dream
to
make
sense
of
the
belief
that
they
need
to
wake
up
,
but
they
have
not
realized
that
y
will
not
have
a
continuation
of
the
beliefs
of
their
dream
representative
.
the
dream
here
involves
awareness
of
the
dream
state
without
controllability
over
the
dream
(
for
they
still
seem
to
be
going
along
with
the
content
as
though
it
were
real
)
.
there
is
another
type
of
common
,
partial-lucid
dream
in
which
people
wake
up
from
a
dream
and
are
able
to
return
to
it
upon
sleeping
and
change
the
course
of
the
dream
.
this
type
of
dream
seems
to
involve
controllability
without
awareness



they
treat
it
as
real
and
do
not
treat
it
as
an
acknowledged
dream
but
are
able
to
have
much
more
control
over
the
content
than
usual
.
lucid
dreamers
used
in
experimental
settings
are
much
more
experienced
and
have
lucid
dreams
in
the
strongest
sense



they
are
aware
they
are
dreaming
(
and
can
maintain
this
awareness
for
a
significant
duration
of
time
)
,
have
control
over
the
content
and
have
a
level
of
clarity
of
thinking
akin
to
waking
life
.

there
are
a
number
of
further
implications
of
laberge



s
findings
for
various
philosophical
claims
.
the
existence
of
communication
during
lucid
dreaming
challenges
augustine



s
idea
that
dreams
are
not
actions
.

if
we
can
gain
the
same
level
of
agency
we
have
in
waking
life
during
lucid
dreaming
,
then
it
might
be
the
case
that
even
ordinary
dreams
carry
some
,
albeit
reduced
,
form
of
agency
.
we
might
want
to
believe
this
new
claim
if
we
accept
that
agency
is
not
suddenly
invoked
during
lucidity
,
but
is
rather
enhanced
.
the
findings
also
open
up
the
possibility
to
test
the
claim
that
somebody
who
is
dreaming
cannot
tell
that
they
are
not
awake
,
further
undermining
descartes



claim
that
dreaming
and
waking
experiences
are
inherently
indistinguishable
.

previously
,
philosophers
who
wanted
to
resist
the
sceptical
argument
would
say
that
someone
who
is
dreaming
might
be
able
unable
to
distinguish
the
state
they
were
in
but
not
that
someone
awake
is
unable
to
distinguish
,
for
example
,
locke



s
point
that
if
we
are
in
pain
then
we
must
be
in
an
awake
state
.
had
descartes
been
a
lucid
dreamer
,
then
when
he
was
sat
by
the
fire
,
his
phrase
might
have
come
out
as


i
am
now
seated
by
the
fire
but
i
have
also
been
deceived
in
dreams
into
believing
i
have
been
seated
by
the
fire



though
on
occasion
i
have
realized
that
i
was
just
dreaming
when
apparently
seated
by
the
fire
and
so
was
not
deceived
at
all
!



it
is
surely
a
contingent
fact
that
people
rarely
have
lucid
dreams
.
if
people
lucidly
dreamt
much
more
often
,
then
descartes



sceptical
dream
argument
would
have
had
little
to
motivate
it
.
work
on
communicative
lucid
dreaming
might
also
open
up
the
possibility
to
test
further
phenomenally
distinguishing
features
between
the
two
states
via
individuals
communicating
statements
about
these
features
.

ii
.
alternative
explanations
for


precognitive



dreams
dennett
had
cited
an
interesting
type
of
dream
report
where
the
ending
of
the
dream
was
strongly
implied
by
the
stimulus
of
awakening
.
for
example
:
having
a
dream
of
getting
married
end
with
the
sound
of
church
bells
ringing
,
which
coincides
with
the
sound
of
the
alarm
clock
.
these
seemingly
precognitive
dreams
are
sometimes
referred
to
in
the
literature
as


the
anecdotes



because
of
their
generally
non-experimental
form
.
though
they
are
remote
from
scientific
investigation
,
the
mere
existence
of
the
anecdotes
at
all
caused
trouble
for
the
received
view
and
requires
explanation
.
they
provide
extra
evidence
for
dennett



s
proposed
paradigm
shift
of
dreaming
.
on
the
other
hand
,
if
there
is
enough
evidence
to
claim
that
dreams
are
consciously
experienced
during
sleep
then
the
anecdotal
data
of
dreams
will
not
be
a
powerful
enough
counterexample
;
they
will
not
warrant
a
paradigm
shift
in
our
thinking
about
dreams
.
the
biggest
challenge
the
anecdotes
represent
is
that
on
occasion
the
memory
can
significantly
deviate
from
the
actual
experience
.
on
this
view
,
false
memories
overriding
the
actual
content
of
the
dream
does
occur
,
but
these
experiences
are
the
exception
rather
than
the
rule
.

though
laberge



s
experiments
suggest
that
the
content
of
dreams
consciously
occurs
during
sleep
,
the
findings
on
their
own
are
insufficient
to
draw
the
conclusion
that
all
dreams
occur
during
sleep
.

the
existence
of
the
anecdotes
blocks
one
from
drawing
that
conclusion
.

but
these
anecdotes
can
be
explained
on
the
received
view
.
it
is
already
known
that
the
human
species
has
specific
bodily
rhythms
for
sleep
.
further
,
there
is
a
noted
phenomenon
that
people
wake
up
at
the
same
time
even
when
their
alarm
clocks
are
off
.
dennett
himself
says
that
he
had
got
out
his
old
alarm
clock
that
he
had
not
used
in
months
and
set
the
alarm
himself
(
dennett
,
1976
:
p
.
157
)



presumably
for
a
time
he
usually
gets
up
at
anyway
.
if
the
subconscious
can
be
credited
with
either
creating
a
dream
world
on
the
received
view
or
a
dream
memory
on
the
dennettian
view
and
the
personal
body
clock
works
with
some
degree
of
automaticity
during
sleep
,
one
may
well
ask
why
the
dream



s
anticipation
(
and
symbolic
representation
)
of
this
need
be
precognitive
in
a
paranormal
sense
.
had
dennett
woken
up
earlier
,
he
may
have
lain
in
bed
realizing
that
his
alarm
clock
was
going
to
go
off
,
which
is
not
considered
an
act
of
precognition
.
had
he
thought
this
during
sleep
,
the
received
view
would
expect
it
to
be
covered
symbolically
via
associative
imagery
.
thus
,
perhaps
dennett
is
not
being
impartial
in
his
treatment
of
dreams
,
and
his
argument
begs
the
question
since
he
is
considering
the
received
view



s
version
of
dreaming
to
be
inferior
to
his
own
theory
by
assuming
that
thought
in
dreaming
is
completely
oblivious
to
the
banalities
of
the
future
.

arguably
,
the
other
anecdotes
can
be
explained
away
.
recall
the
most
famous
anecdote
,
where
maury
was
dragged
to
the
guillotine
with
the
headboard
falling
on
his
neck
,
waking
him
up
(
freud
discusses
the
case
of
maury
in
the
first
chapter
of
his
interpretation
of
dreams
)
.
maury
may
have
had
some
ongoing
and
subconscious
awareness
of
the
wobbliness
of
his
headboard
before
it
fell
(
presumably
it
did
not
fall
without
movement
on
his
part



possibly
in
resistance
to
being
beheaded
.

maury



s
could
thus
be
a
type
of
dreaming
involving
self-fulfilling
prophecy
)
that
is
left
out
of
the
overall
account
.
dennett



s
account
agrees
that
any
unconscious
awareness
of
the
outside
environment
is
represented
differently
in
the
dream
.
maury
would
have
had
enough
time
to
form
the
simple
association
of
his
headboard
being
like
a
guillotine
from
the
french
revolution
.
if
he
had
some
awareness
of
the
looseness
of
his
headboard
,
then
the
thought
:


if
this
headboard
falls
on
me
it
will
be
like
being
beheaded
,



would
be
appropriately
synchronized
into
the
dream
.

though
it
is
possible
to
provide
alternative
explanation
for
some
of
the
anecdotes
,
it
might
be
worth
dividing
dennett



s
anecdotes
into
hard
and
soft
anecdotes
.
a
hard
anecdote
is
outlined
by
dennett
:
a
car
backfires
outside
and
an
individual
wakes
up
with
the
memory
of
a
dream
logically
leading
up
to
being
shot
.
the
soft
anecdotes
,
those
already
mentioned
(
such
as
maury



s
and
dennett



s
own
examples
)
,
can
at
least
be
alternatively
explained
.
the
hard
anecdotes
,
on
the
other
hand
,
cannot
simply
be
explained
by
appeal
to
body
clocks
and
anticipation
in
sleep
.

the
hard
anecdotes
reveal
that
the
dreamer
has
no
idea
what
will
wake
them
up
in
the
morning
,
if
anything
(
maybe
the
alarm
will
not
actually
go
off
;
or
the
truck
backfiring
could
occur
at
any
point
)
.
the
soft
anecdotes
might
involve
outside
stimuli
being
unconsciously
incorporated
into
the
dream
.
the
only
hard
anecdote
mentioned
in
dennett



s
paper
is
made
up
by
dennett
himself
to
outline
his
theory
,
rather
than
representing
a
genuine
example
of
a
dream
.
notice
that
a
hard
anecdote
could
favour
the
received
view



if
experimenters
switched
off
an
alarm
that
a
participant
had
set
and
that
individual
woke
with
a
dream
which
seemed
to
anticipate
the
alarm
going
off
at
the
set
time
(
for
example
,
had
dennett



s
goat
dream
occurred
despite
his
alarm
not
going
off
)
then
we
might
do
best
to
conclude
that
the
dream
consciously
occurred
during
sleep
in
a
sequential
order
leading
up
to
the
awakening
.
dennett
is
right
that
the
issue
is
worth
empirically
investigating
.
if
a
survey
found
that
hard
anecdote-like
dreams
(
such
as
a
truck
back-firing
and
waking
with
a
dream
thematically
similar
)
occur
often
,
then
the
received
view
is
either
dis-confirmed
or
must
find
a
way
to
make
room
for
such
dreams
.

dennett
might
reply
that
he
does
not
need
to
wait
for
the
empirical
evidence
to
reveal
that
the
hard
anecdotes
are
common
.
he
might
simply
deny
that
the
alternative
explanation
of
the
soft
anecdotes
is
not
credible
.
if
the
attempt
to
explain
the
soft
anecdotes
are
not
credible
(
as
a
dennettian
might
object
)
,
they
at
least
draw
attention
to
the
extraneous
variables
in
each
of
the
anecdotes
.
dennett



s
sole
reason
for
preferring
his
retro-selection
theory
over
the
received
view
is
so
an
explanation
can
account
for
the
anecdotal
data
.
but
dennett
uses
his
own
alarm
clock
which
he
himself
set
the
night
before
;
maury
uses
his
own
bed
;
dennett
of
course
admits
that
the
evidence
is
anecdotal
and
not
experimental
.
in
one
of
the
few
actual
experiments
carried
out
,
water
is
slowly
dripped
onto
a
sleeping
participant



s
back
to
wake
them
up
,
but
this
is
not
timed
and
is
akin
to
a
soft
anecdote
.
more
empirical
work
needs
to
be
done
to
clarify
the
issue
and
for
the
debate
to
move
forward
.

the
anecdotes
are
a
specific
subclass
of
prophetic
dreams
.
it
is
worth
noting
a
related
issue
about
dreams
which
are
alleged
to
have
a
more
prophetic
nature
.
it
seems
from
the
subjective
point
of
view
that
if
one
was
to
have
had
a
dream
about
a
plane
crash
the
night
before
(
or
morning
of
)
september
11^th
2001
this
would
have
been
a
premonitory
dream
.
or
one
might
dream
of
a
relative
or
celebrity
dying
and
then
wake
to
find
this
actually
happens
in
real
life
.
the
probability
of
the
occurrence
of
a
dream
being
loosely
(
or
even
exactly
)
about
an
unforeseen
,
future
event
is
increased
when
one
has
a
whole
lifetime
of
dreams



a
lifetime
to
generate
one
or
two
coincidences
.
the
dreams
which
are
not
premonitory
are
under-reported
and
the
apparently
prophetic
dreams
are
over-reported
.
the
probability
of
having
a
dream
with
content
vaguely
similar
to
the
future
is
increased
by
the
fact
that
a
single
individual
has
many
dreams
over
a
lifetime
.
big
events
are
witnessed
and
acknowledged
by
large
numbers
of
people
which
increases
the
probability
that
someone
will
have
a
dream
with
similar
content
(
dawkins
,
1998
:
p
.
158
)
.
no
doubt
when
the
twin
towers
were
attacked
some
people
just
so
happened
to
have
dreams
about
plane
crashes
,
and
a
few
might
have
even
had
dreams
more
or
less
related
to
planes
crashing
into
towers
,
or
even
the
twin
towers
.
billions
of
dreams
would
have
been
generated
the
night
prior
,
as
they
are
every
night
around
the
world
,
and
so
some
would
have
invariably


hit
the
mark
.



dennett



s
anecdotes
are
somewhat
different
,
but
they
too
may
have
the
same
problem
of
being
over-reported
in
this
way
.
at
the
same
time
,
they
may
also
suffer
from
being
under-reported
because
they
are
not
always
obviously
related
to
the
stimulus
of
awakening
,
particularly
where
someone
pays
attention
to
the
content
of
the
dream
and
forgets
how
they
awakened
.
hence
,
the
extent
to
which
we
experience
anecdote-like
dreams
is
currently
uncertain
,
though
they
can
be
explained
on
the
received
view
.

the
function
of
dreaming
the
function
of
dreaming



exactly
why
we
dream
and
what
purpose
it
could
fulfil
in
helping
us
to
survive
and
reproduce



is
explained
in
evolutionary
terms
of
natural
selection
.
natural
selection
is
best
understood
as
operating
through
three
principles
:
variation
,
heredity
and
selection
.
a
group
of
living
creatures
within
a
species
vary
from
one
another
in
their
traits
,
their
traits
are
passed
on
to
their
own
offspring
,
and
there
is
competition
for
survival
and
reproduction
amongst
all
of
these
creatures
.
the
result
is
that
those
creatures
that
have
traits
better
suited
for
surviving
and
reproducing
will
be
precisely
the
creatures
to
survive
,
reproduce
and
pass
on
the
successful
traits
.
most
traits
of
any
organism
are
implicated
in
helping
it
to
survive
and
thereby
typically
serve
some
purpose
.

although
the
question
of
what
dreaming
might
do
for
us
has
to
this
day
remained
a
mystery
,
there
has
never
been
a
shortage
of
proposed
theories
.
the
most
sustained
first
attempt
to
account
for
why
we
dream
comes
from
freud
(
1900
)
,
whose
theory
was
countered
by
his
friend
and
later
adversary
carl
jung
.
an
outline
of
these
two
early
approaches
will
be
followed
by
a
leading
theory
in
philosophical
and
neuro-biological
literature
:
that
dreaming
is
an
evolutionary
by-product
.
on
this
view
,
dreaming
has
no
function
but
comes
as
a
side
effect
of
other
useful
traits
,
namely
,
cognition
and
sleep
.
a
contemporary
theory
opposing
the
view
that
dreaming
has
no
function
,
in
comparison
,
holds
that
dreaming
is
a
highly
advantageous
state
where
the
content
of
the
dream
aids
an
organism
in
later
waking
behaviour
that
is
survival-enhancing
by
rehearsing
the
perception
and
avoidance
of
threat
.

a
.
early
approaches
i
.
freud
:
psychoanalysis
the
psychoanalytic
approach
,
initiated
by
freud
,
gives
high
esteem
to
dreams
as
a
key
source
of
insight
into
,
and
the
main
method
of
opening
up
,
the
unconscious
(
freud
,
1900
:
§vii
,
e
,
p
.
381
)
.
psychoanalysis
is
a
type
of
therapy
aimed
at
helping
people
overcome
mental
problems
.

therapy
often
involves
in
depth
analyses
of
patient



s
dreams
.
in
order
to
analyse
dreams
though
,
freudian
psychoanalysis
is
committed
to
an
assumption
that
dreams
are
fulfilling
a
certain
function
.
freud
explicitly
put
forward
a
theory
of
the
function
of
dreams
.
he
believed
that
dreams
have
not
been
culturally
generated
by
humans
,
as
malcolm
thought
,
but
are
rather
a
mental
activity
that
our
ancestors
also
experienced
.
during
sleep
,
the
mind
is
disconnected
from
the
external
world
but
remains
instinctual
.
the
psychoanalytic
take
on
dreaming
is
better
understood
in
terms
of
freud



s
overall
picture
of
the
mind
,
which
he
split
into
id
,
ego
and
super-ego
.
the
id
is
an
entirely
unconscious
part
of
the
mind
,
something
we
cannot
gain
control
of
,
but
is
rather
only
systematically
suppressed
.
it
is
present
at
birth
,
does
not
understand
the
differences
between
opposites
and
seeks
to
satisfy
its
continually
generated
libidinal
instinctual
impulses
(
storr
,
1989
:
p
.
61
)
.
the
id
precedes
any
sense
of
self
,
is
chaotic
,
aggressive
,
unorganised
,
produces
no
collective
will
and
is
incapable
of
making
value
judgements
as
the
child
develops
and
grows
up
his
instinctual
needs
as
a
baby
are
repressed
and
covered
up
(
storr
,
1989
:
p
.
63
)
.
if
humans
were
guided
only
by
the
id
they
would
behave
like
babies
,
trying
to
fulfil
their
every
need
instantly
,
without
being
able
to
wait
;
the
id
has
no
conception
of
time
.
it
is
the
id
that
will
get
an
individual
into
social
trouble
.
the
super-ego
is
the
opposing
,
counterbalance
to
the
id
,
containing
all
of
our
social
norms
such
as
morality
.
though
we
grow
up
and
develop
egos
and
super-egos
,
the
id
constantly
generates
new
desires
that
pressurize
us
in
our
overall
psychologies
and
social
relations
.
the
work
of
repression
is
constant
for
as
long
as
we
are
alive
.
the
super-ego
is
mostly
unconscious
.
in
the
case
of
dreams
,
the
work
of
censorship
is
carried
out
by
the
super-ego
.
the
ego
was
initially
conceived
by
freud
as
our
sense
of
self
.
he
later
thought
of
it
more
as
planning
,
delayed
gratification
and
other
types
of
thinking
that
have
developed
late
in
evolution
.
the
ego
is
mostly
conscious
and
has
to
balance
the
struggle
between
the
id
and
the
super-ego
and
also
in
navigating
the
external
and
internal
worlds
.
this
means
that
we
experience
the
continual
power
struggle
between
the
super-ego
and
the
id
.
the
ego
has
to
meet
a
quota
of
fulfilling
some
of
the
id



s
desires
,
but
only
where
this
will
marginally
affect
the
individual
.

freud



s
first
topographical
division
of
the
mind
consisted
of
the
conscious
,
pre-conscious
and
unconscious
(
the
pre-conscious
is
that
which
is
not
quite
conscious
but
could
quite
easily
be
brought
into
conscious
awareness
)
.
his
second
division
of
the
mind
into
id
,
ego
and
super-ego
explains
how
consciousness
can
become
complicated
when
the
two
topographies
are
superimposed
upon
one
another
.
mental
content
from
the
unconscious
constantly
struggles
to
become
conscious
.
dreams
are
an
example
of
unconscious
content
coming
up
to
the
conscious
and
being
partially
confronted
in
awareness
,
although
the
content
is
distorted
.

dreaming
is
an
opportunity
for
the
desires
of
the
id
to
be
satisfied
without
causing
the
individual
too
much
trouble
.
we
cannot
experience
the
desires
of
the
id
in
naked
form
,
for
they
would
be
too
disturbing
.

the
super-ego
finds
various
ways
of
censoring
a
dream
and
fulfilling
the
desires
latently
.
our
conscious
attention
is
effectively
misdirected
.
what
we
recall
of
dreams
is
further
distorted
as
repression
and
censorship
continues
into
attempted
recollections
of
the
dream
.
the
resulting
dream
is
always
a
compromise
between
disguise
and
the
direct
expression
of
the
id



s
desires
.
the
censorship
is
carried
out
in
various
ways
(
hopkins
,
1991
:
pp
.
112-113
)
.
images
which
are
associated
with
each
other
are
condensed
(
two
people
might
become
one
,
characters
may
morph
based
on
fleeting
similarities
)
and
emotions
are
displaced
onto
other
objects
.
dreams
are
woven
together
in
a
story-like
element
to
further
absorb
the
dreamer
in
the
manifest
content
.

it
is
better
that
these
wishes
come
disguised
in
apparently
nonsensical
stories
in
order
to
stop
the
dreamer
from
awakening
in
horror
(
flanagan
:
2000
,
p
.
43
)
.
the
content
of
the
dream
,
even
with
some
censorship
in
place
,
still
might
shock
an
individual
on
waking
reflection
and
is
therefore
further
distorted
by
the
time
it
reaches
memory
,
for
the
censor
is
still
at
work
.
malcolm
positively
cited
a
psychoanalyst
who
had
claimed
that
the
psychoanalyst
is
really
interested
in
what
the
patient
thought
the
dream
was
about
(
that
is
,
the
memory
of
the
dream
)
rather
than
the
actual
experience
(
malcolm
,
1959
:
pp
.
121-123
,
appendix
)
.

though
freud
was
not
an
evolutionary
biologist
,
his
theory
of
dreams
can
be
easily
recast
in
evolutionary
terms
of
natural
selection
.
freud
thought
that
we
dream
in
the
way
we
do
because
it
aids
individuals
in
surviving
and
so
is
passed
on
and
therefore
positively
selected
.

individuals
who
dreamt
in
a
significantly
different
way
would
not
have
survived
and
reproduced
,
and
their
way
of
dreaming
would
have
died
with
them
.
but
how
does
dreaming
help
individuals
to
survive
?
freud
postulates
that
dreaming
simultaneously
serves
two
functions
.
the
primary
function
at
the
psychological
level
is
wish
fulfilment
(
storr
,
1989
:
p
.
44
)
.
during
the
day
humans
have
far
too
many
desires
than
they
could
possibly
satisfy
.
these
are
the
desires
continually
generated
by
the
id
.
desire
often
provides
the
impetus
for
action
.
if
acted
upon
,
some
of
these
desires
might
get
the
individual
killed
or
in
social
trouble
,
such
as
isolation
or
ostracism
which
may
potentially
result
in
not
reproducing
.
since
wish
fulfilment
occurring
during
sleep
is
a
mechanism
that
could
keep
their
desires
in
check
,
the
mechanism
would
be
selected
for
.
freud
claims
that
,
having
fulfilled
the
multifarious
desires
of
the
id
in
sleep
,
they
can
remain
suppressed
during
the
following
days
.
the
individual
no
longer
needs
to
carry
the
action
out
in
waking
life
,
thereby
potentially
stopping
the
individual
from
being
killed
or
having
fitness
levels
severely
reduced
.
this
provides
reason
as
to
why
we
would
need
to
sleep
with
conscious
imagery
.
freud
only
applied
his
theory
to
humans
but
it
could
be
extrapolated
to
other
animals
that
also
have
desires



for
example
,
mammals
and
other
vertebrates
,
though
the
desires
of
most
members
of
the
animal
kingdom
will
surely
be
less
complex
than
that
of
human
desire
.

the
primary
function
at
the
physiological
level
is
to
keep
an
individual
asleep
while
satisfying
unconscious
desires
(
freud
,
1900
:
§v
,
c
,
p
.
234
)
.
also
,
it
is
clear
that
keeping
an
individual
asleep
and
stopping
him
or
her
from
actually
carrying
out
the
desires
during
sleep
is
beneficial
to
survival
.
so
though
the
individual
has
their
desires
satisfied
during
sleep
,
it
is
done
so
in
a
disguised
manner
.
here
,
freud
separates
the
dream
into
manifest
and
latent
content
.
the
manifest
content
is
the
actual
content
that
is
experienced
and
recalled
at
the
surface
level
(
a
dream
of
travelling
on
a
train
as
it
goes
through
a
tunnel
)
.
the
latent
content
is
the
underlying
desire
that
is
being
fulfilled
by
the
manifest
content
(
a
desire
for
sexual
intercourse
with
somebody
that
will
land
the
dreaming
individual
in
trouble
)
.
the
individual
is
kept
asleep
by
the
unconscious
disguising
the
wishes
.

what
about
dreams
where
the
manifest
content
seems
to
be
emotionally
painful
,
distressing
,
or
a
good
example
of
an
anxiety
dream
,
rather
than
wish
fulfilment
?
how
can
our
desires
be
satisfied
when
our
experiences
do
not
seem
to
involve
what
we
wanted
?
freud
suggests
that
these
can
be
examples
where
the
dream
fails
to
properly
disguise
the
content
.
indeed
,
these
usually
wake
the
individual
up
.
freud
was
aware
of
an
early
study
which
suggested
that
dream
content
is
biased
towards
the
negative
(
freud
,
1900
:
pp
.
193-194
)



a
study
which
has
been
subsequently
confirmed
.
freud



s
distinction
between
manifest
and
latent
content
explains
away
this
objection
.
the
underlying
,
latent
content
carries
the
wish
and
dreams
are
distorted
by
a
psychological
censor
because
they
will
wake
an
individual
up
if
they
are
too
disturbing
,
and
then
the
desire
will
remain
unsuppressed
.
perhaps
dreams
operate
with
an
emotion
which
is
the
opposite
of
gratification
precisely
to
distract
the
sleeping
individual
from
the
true
nature
of
the
desire
.
wish
fulfilment
might
be
carried
out
in
the
form
of
an
anxiety
dream
where
the
desire
is
especially
disturbing
if
realized
.
other
anxiety
dreams
can
actually
fulfil
wishes
through
displacement
of
the
emotions
.
freud
uses
an
example
of
one
of
his
own
dreams
where
a
patient
is
infected
but
it
fulfils
the
wish
of
alleviating
the
guilt
he
felt
that
he
could
not
cure
her
(
the
dream
of
irma



s
injection
)
.
the
dream
allowed
the
blame
to
be
lifted
away
from
himself
and
projected
onto
a
fellow
doctor
who
was
responsible
for
the
injection
.
despite
the
displeasure
of
the
dream
,
the
wish
for
the
alleviation
guilt
was
fulfilled
.

the
dream
for
freudians
relies
on
a
distinction
between
indicative
and
imperative
content
.
an
indicative
state
of
mind
is
where
my
representational
systems
show
the
world
to
be
a
certain
way
.
the
exemplar
instance
of
indicative
representations
is
belief
.
i
might
accurately
perceive
and
believe
that
it
is
raining
and
i
thus
have
an
indicative
representational
mental
state
.
imperative
states
of
mind
,
on
the
other
hand
,
are
ones
in
which
i
desire
the
world
to
be
a
certain
way



a
way
that
is
different
to
the
way
it
currently
is
.
i
might
desire
that
it
will
snow
.
a
dream
is
an
instance
of
an
indicative
representation
replacing
an
imperative
one
in
order
to
suppress
a
desire
.
we
see
something
in
a
dream
and
believe
it
is
there
in
front
of
us
.
this
is
what
we
want
and
what
we
desired
,
so
once
we
believe
we
have
it
,
the
desire
is
vanquished
,
making
it
unlikely
we
will
try
to
satisfy
the
desire
in
waking
life
.

jung
:
analytic
psychology
trying
to
provide
even
a
simple
exposition
of
freud



s
or
jung



s
theories
of
dreams
will
not
please
all
scholars
and
practitioners
that
adhere
to
the
thinkers



traditions
.
drawing
out
the
differences
or
similarities
between
their
views
is
an
exegetical
task
and
the
resulting
statements
about
their
theories
are
thus
always
debatable
.

many
working
in
the
tradition
of
psychoanalysis
or
analytical
psychology
opt
for
a
synthesis
between
their
views
.
at
the
risk
of
caricaturing
jung



s
theory
of
dreams
,
the
differences
in
their
views
will
be
emphasized
to
contrast
with
freud



s
.

like
freud
,
jung
also
believed
that
dream
analysis
is
a
major
way
of
gaining
knowledge
about
the
unconscious



a
deep
facet
of
the
mind
that
has
been
present
in
our
ancestors
throughout
evolutionary
history
.
but
jung



s
evolutionary
story
of
dreaming
differs
from
freud



s
.
whereas
freud
understood
dreams
as
using
memory
from
the
days
preceding
the
dream
(
particularly
the


day
residue



of
the
day
immediately
leading
up
to
the
dream
)
and
earlier
childhood
experiences
,
jung
thought
the
dream
also
worked
with
more
distant
material
:
the
collective
unconscious
.
the
collective
unconscious
is
where
the
ancestral
memories
of
the
species
are
stored
and
are
common
to
all
people
.
some
philosophers
,
such
as
locke
,
had
believed
the
mind
is
a
blank
slate
.
jung
believed
that
the
collective
unconscious
underlies
the
psychology
of
all
humans
and
is
even
identical
across
some
different
species
.
the
collective
unconscious
is
especially
pronounced
in
dreaming
where
universal
symbols
are
processed
,
known
as
the
archetypes
.
the
distinction
between
signs
and
symbols
is
an
important
one
(
jung
,
1968
:
p
.
3
)
.
signs
refer
to
what
is
already
known
,
whereas
symbols
contain
a
multiplicity
of
meanings
(
mathers
,
2001
:
p
.
116
)
.
more
,
indeed
,
than
can
be
captured
,
thereby
always
leaving
an
unknowable
aspect
,
and
hence
always
requiring
further
work
to
think
about
the
dream
,
thereby
hinting
at
future
perspectives
one
may
take
toward
oneself
and
one



s
dreams
(
mathers
,
2001
:
p
.
116
)
.

jung
saw
dreaming
as
playing
an
integral
role
in
the
overall
architecture
of
the
mind
and
conducive
to
surviving
in
the
world
for
during
the
process
of
dreaming
the
day



s
experiences
are
connected
to
previous
experiences
and
our
whole
personal
history
.
whereas
freud
thought
that
the
adaptive
advantage
to
dreams
was
to
distract
us
and
thereby
keep
us
asleep
,
jung
thought
the
reverse
:
we
need
to
sleep
in
order
to
dream
and
dreaming
serves
multiple
functions
.
what
does
dreaming
do
for
us
,
according
to
jung
?
dreams
compensate
for
imbalances
in
the
conscious
attitudes
of
the
dreamer
.
psychology
depends
upon
the
interplay
of
opposites
(
jung
,
1968
:
p
.
47
)
.
by
dreaming
of
opposite
possibilities
to
waking
life
,
such
as
a
logical
individual
(
with
a
strong
thinking
function
)
having
dreams
which
are
much
more
feeling


based
,
the
balance
is
restored
(
stevens
,
1994
:
p
.
106
)
.


dreams
perform
some
homeostatic
or
self-regulatory
function



they
obey
the
biological
imperative
of
adaptation
in
the
interests
of
personal
adjustment
,
growth
,
and
survival



(
stevens
,
1994
:
p
.
104
)
.
they
play
a
role
in
keeping
the
individual
appropriately
adapted
to
their
social
setting
.
dreaming
also
carries
out
a
more
general
type
of
compensation
,
concerning
the
psychology
of
gender
.
the
psyche
is
essentially
androgynous
and
so
dreams
provide
an
opportunity
to
balance
the
overall
self
to
an
individual



s
opposite
gender
that
make
up
their
personality
and
mind
.
hence
dreams
are
not
the
mere


guardians
of
sleep



as
freud
thought
,
but
are
rather
a
necessary
part
to
maintaining
psychological
well
being
and
development
.
when
the
conscious
is
not
put
in
touch
with
the
unconscious
,
homeostasis
is
lost
and
psychological
disturbance
will
result
(
jung
,
1968
:
p
.
37
)
.
dreams
serve
up
unconscious
content
that
has
been
repressed
,
ignored
or
undervalued
in
waking
life
.
although
he
emphasized
an
objective
element
to
dreaming
(
that
the
unconscious
often
makes
use
of
universal
and
culturally
shared
symbols
)
,
jung
was
opposed
to
the
possibility
of
a
fixed
dream
dictionary
because
the
meaning
of
symbols
will
change
depending
on
the
dreamer
and
over
time
as
they
associate
images
with
different
meanings
.

jung
agrees
with
freud
that
there
are
a
wealth
of
symbols
and
allegorical
imagery
that
can
stand
in
for
the
sexual
act
,
from
breaking
down
a
door
to
placing
a
sword
in
a
sheath
.
in
the
course
of
his
analysis
,
freud
would
gradually
move
from
manifest
content
to
the
latent
content
,
though
he
did
encourage
the
dreamer
to
give
their
own
interpretations
through
free
association
.
jung
believed
that
the
unconscious
choice
of
symbol
itself
is
just
as
important
and
can
tell
us
something
about
that
individual
(
jung
,
1968
:
p
.
14
)
.
alternatively
,
apparent
phallic
symbols
might
symbolize
other
notions



a
key
in
a
lock
might
symbolize
hope
or
security
,
rather
than
anything
sexual
.
the
dream
imagery
,
what
freud
called
the
manifest
content
,
is
what
will
reveal
the
meaning
of
the
dream
.
where
freud
had
asked


what
is
the
dream
trying
to
hide
?



jung
asks
:


what
is
the
dream
trying
to
express
or
communicate
?



because
dreams
occur
without
a
censor
:
they
are


undistorted
and
purposeful



(
whitmont
&
perera
,
1989
:
p
.
1
)
.

another
function
of
dreaming
that
distinguishes
jung



s
from
freud



s
account
is
that
dreams
provide
images
of
the
possibilities
the
future
may
have
in
store
for
the
sleeping
individual
.
not
that
dreams
are
precognitive
in
a
paranormal
sense
,
jung
emphasized
,
but
the
unconscious
clearly
does
entertain
counter-factual
situations
during
sleep
.
those
possibilities
entertained
are
usually
general
aspects
of
human
character
that
are
common
to
us
all
(
johnson
,
2009
:
p
.
46
)
.
dreams
sometimes
warn
us
of
dangerous
upcoming
events
,
but
all
the
same
,
they
do
not
always
do
so
(
jung
,
1968
:
p
.
36
)
.
the
connection
of
present
events
to
past
experience
is
where
dreams
are
especially
functional
(
mathers
,
2001
:
p
.
126
)
.
freud
and
jung



s
theories
clearly
overlap
here
.

but
whereas
freud
assessed
dreams
in
terms
of
looking
back
into
the
past
,
especially
the
antagonisms
of
childhood
experience
,
dreaming
for
jung
importantly
also
lays
out
the
possibilities
of
the
future
.
this
clearly
has
survival
value
,
since
it
is
in
the
future
where
that
individual
will
eventually
develop
and
try
to
survive
and
reproduce
.

dreaming
for
jung
is
like


dreaming



in
the
other
sense



that
of
aspiring
,
wishing
and
hoping
.
dreams
point
towards
our
future
development
and
individuation
.
the
notion
of
personal
development
brought
about
by
dreaming
might
depend
upon
regularly
recalling
a
dream
,
which
is
something
that
freud



s
claim
of
wish
fulfilment
need
not
be
committed
to
,
and
it
is
not
clear
how
this
deals
with
animal



s
dreaming
.

dreams
are
a
special
instance
of
the
collective
unconscious
at
work
,
where
we
can
trace
much
more
ancient
symbolism
.
the
collective
unconscious
gives
rise
to
the
archetypes
:


the
universal
patterns
or
tendencies
in
the
human
unconscious
that
find
their
way
into
our
individual
psyches
and
form
us
.
they
are
actually
the
psychological
building
blocks
of
energy
that
combine
together
to
create
the
individual
psyche



(
johnson
,
2009
:
p
.
46
)
.
dreams
demonstrate
how
the
unconscious
processes
thought
in


the
language
of
symbolism



(
johnson
,
2009
:
p
.
4
)
.
the
most
important
function
of
dreams
is
teaching
us
how
to
think
symbolically
and
deal
with
communication
from
the
unconscious
.

dreams
always
have
a
multiplicity
of
meanings
,
can
be
re-interpreted
and
new
meanings
discovered
.
jung
believed
that


meaning
making
enhances
survival



(
mathers
,
2001
:
p
.
117
)
.
according
to
flanagan
,
it
is
much
harder
to
construe
jung



s
theory
of
dreams
as
adhering
to
the
basic
tenets
of
evolutionary
biology
than
freud



s
,
for
two
fundamental
reasons
.
firstly
,
why
would
the
collective
unconscious
expressing
symbols
relevant
to
the
species
have
any
gains
in
terms
of
reproductive
success
?
secondly
,
jung



s
theory
is
more
often
interpreted
in
lamarckian
,
and
not
darwinian
,
terms
,
which
leaves
it
out
in
the
cold
in
regards
to
accepted
evolutionary
biology
(
flanagan
,
2000
:
p
.
44
)
.

according
to
lamarck



s
conception
of
evolution
,
traits
developed
during
a
lifetime
can
then
be
subsequently
passed
onto
the
next
generation
.

hence
lamarck
believed
that
the
giraffe
got
its
long
neck
because
one
stretched
its
neck
during
its
lifetime
to
reach
high
up
leaves
and
this
made
the
neck
longer
,
a
trait
which
was
passed
onto
its
offspring
.

according
to
the
widely
favoured
darwinian
view
of
evolution
,
those
giraffes
that
just
so
happened
to
have
a
longer
neck
would
have
had
access
to
the
source
of
food
over
those
with
shorter
necks
,
and
would
have
been
selected
.
jung



s
theory
is
interpreted
as
lamarckian
rather
than
darwinian
because
symbols
that
are
learned
during
an
individual



s
particular
historical
period
can
be
genetically
encoded
and
passed
on
(
flanagan
,
2000
:
p
.
64
)
.
perhaps
one
could
reply
in
jungian-darwinian
terms
that
those
individuals
who
just
so
happened
to
be
born
with
a
brain
receptive
to
certain
symbols
having
certain
meanings
(
rather
than
learning
them
)
,
survived
over
those
individuals
that
did
not
.
but
then
flanagan



s
first
reason
remains
as
an
objection



what
advantage
would
this
have
in
terms
of
surviving
?
others
have
argued
that
the
collective
unconscious
is
actually
much
more
scientifically
credible
than
critics
have
taken
it
to
be
.
according
to
the
line
of
argument
,
the
collective
unconscious
essentially
coincides
with
current
views
about
innate
behaviours
,
in
fields
such
as
socio-biology
and
ethology
(
stevens
,
1994
:
p
.
51
)
.
appropriate
environmental
(
or
cognitive
)
stimuli
trigger
patterns
of
behaviours
or
thought
that
are
inherited
,
such
as
hunting
,
fighting
and
mothering
.
in
humans
,
there
are
,
for
example
,
the
universal
expressions
of
emotion
(
anger
,
disgust
,
fear
,
happiness
,
sadness
,
surprise
)
.
humans
and
other
mammals
have
an
inbuilt
fear
of
snakes
that
we
do
not
need
to
learn
.
these
patterns
can
be
found
in
dreams
.
the
dream
images
are
generated
by
homologous
neural
structures
that
are
shared
amongst
animals
,
not
merely
passed
on
to
the
next
generation
as
images
.
the
jungian
can
dodge
the
accusation
of
lamarckism
by
arguing
that
dreams
involve
inherited
patterns
of
behaviour
based
on
epigenetic
rules
(
the
genetically
inherited
rules
upon
which
development
then
proceeds
for
an
individual
)
and
arguing
that
epigenetics
does
not
necessarily
need
to
endorse
lamarckism
(
epigenetics
is
a
hot
topic
in
the
philosophy
of
biology
.
for
a
cogent
introduction
,
readers
can
consult
jablonka
&
lamb
,
2005
)
.

alternatively
,
in
light
of
epigenetics
,
the
jungian
can
defend
a
lamarackist
view
of
evolution



a
re-emerging
but
still
controversial
position
.

to
rehearse
the
differences
:
freud
believed
that
dreams
are
the
result
of
a
power
struggle
between
the
id



s
constantly
generating
desires
and
the
super-ego



s
censorship
of
the
exact
nature
of
these
desires
;
various
techniques
are
employed
by
the
censor
,
including
emotional
displacement
,
weaving
together
a
narrative
to
pay
attention
to
and
reworking
the
latent
desires
into
the
manifest
content
we
experience
and
eventually
and
occasionally
recollect
;
dreams
are
a
distraction
to
keep
us
asleep
;
dreaming
is
a
mechanism
that
has
been
selected
to
provide
social
stability
amongst
individuals
.
dreams
essentially
deal
with
one



s
relationship
to
their
past
.
jung
thought
dreams
point
towards
the
future
development
of
the
individual
.
the
experiences
which
process
symbols
shared
amongst
the
species
are
a
form
of
compensation
to
keep
the
individual
at
a
psychological
homeostasis
.
dreams
do
not
especially
deal
with
sexuality
but
have
a
more
general
attempt
for
the
individual
to
understand
themselves
and
the
world
they
exist
in
.

b
.
contemporary
approaches
i
.
pluralism
flanagan
represents
a
nuanced
position
in
which
dreaming
has
no
fitness-enhancing
effects
on
an
organism
that
dreams
,
but
neither
does
it
detract
from
their
fitness
.
dreams
are
the
by-products
of
sleep
.
the
notion
of
evolutionary
by-product
,
or
spandrel
(
see
figures
6
and
7
)
,
was
first
introduced
by
the
evolutionary
pluralists
gould
and
lewontin
in


the
spandrels
of
san
marco
and
panglossian
paradigm



where
the
authors
borrowed
the
term
from
the
field
of
architecture
.
evolutionary
pluralism
claims
that
traits
in
the
natural
world
are
not
always
the
result
of
natural
selection
,
but
potentially
for
a
plurality
of
other
reasons
.
the
debate
between
adaptationists
and
pluralists
centres
on
the
pervasiveness
of
natural
selection
in
shaping
traits
.
pluralists
look
for
factors
other
than
natural
selection
in
shaping
a
trait
,
such
as
genetic
drift
and
structural
constraints
on
development
.
one
important
example
is
the
spandrel
.
some
traits
might
be
necessary
by-products
of
the
design
of
the
overall
organism
.

fig
6
fig
7
the
two
separate
architectural
examples
,
figures
6
and
7
,
display
spandrels
as
roughly
triangular
spaces
.
the
point
that
gould
and
lewontin
are
making
by
introducing
the
notion
of
spandrel
is
that
some
aspects
of
the
design
of
an
object
inevitably
come
as
a
side-effect
.

perhaps
the
architect
only
wanted
archways
and
a
dome
.
in
producing
such
a
work
of
architecture
,
spandrels
cannot
be
avoided
.
if
architecture
can
tell
us
something
about
metaphysical
truths
,
then
might
dreams
be
such
spandrels
,
lodged
in
between
thought
and
sleep
?

flanagan
,
an
evolutionary
pluralist
,
argues
that
there
is
no
fitness-enhancing
function
of
dreaming
.
though
,
as
a
matter
of
structure
,
we
cannot
avoid
dreaming
for
dreams
sit
in
between
the
functioning
of
the
mind
and
sleep
,
like
spandrels
between
two
architecturally
desired
pillars
in
an
archway
.
hence
flanagan



s
argument
is
that
in
evolutionary
biological
terms
,
dreaming
is
not
for
anything



it
just
comes
as
a
side
effect
to
the
general
architecture
of
the
mind
.
he
states
more
strongly
that


so
long
as
a
spandrel
does
not
come
to
detract
from
fitness
,
it
can
sit
there
forever
as
a
side
effect
or
free
rider
without
acquiring
any
use
whatsoever



(
flanagan
,
2000
:
p
.
108
)
.
dreaming
neither
serves
the
function
of
wish-fulfilment
or
psychological
homeostasis
.
flanagan
emphasizes
the
disorganized
nature
of
dreaming
,
something
which
can
clearly
be
appealed
to
given
any
individual



s
experience
of
dreams
.
to
be
sure
,
wish-fulfilment
and
apparent
psychological
compensation
sometimes
appear
in
dreams
,
but
this
is
because
we
are
just
thinking
during
sleep
and
so
a
myriad
of
human
cognition
will
take
place
.
another
reason
put
forward
by
flanagan
for
the
view
that
dreams
are
spandrels
is
that
,
unlike
for
sleep
,
there
is
nothing
close
to
an
ideal
adaptation
explanation
for
dreaming
(
flanagan
,
2000
:
p
.
113
)
.
the
ideal
explanation
lays
out
what
evidence
there
is
that
selection
has
operated
on
the
trait
,
gives
proof
that
the
trait
is
heritable
,
provides
an
explanation
of
why
some
types
of
the
trait
are
better
adapted
than
others
in
different
environments
and
amongst
other
species
and
also
offers
evidence
of
how
later
versions
of
the
trait
are
derived
from
earlier
ones
.
the
spandrel
thesis
about
dreaming
is
more
plausible
,
then
,
because
trying
to
argue
that
dreams
have
function
ends
up
as
nothing
more
than
a


just-so



story
,
the
result
of
speculation
and
guess
work
that
cannot
meet
the
standards
of
an
ideal
adaptation
explanation
.

ii
.
adaptationism
antti
revonsuo
stands
in
opposition
to
flanagan
by
arguing
that
dreaming
is
an
adaptation
.
he
also
stands
in
opposition
to
freud
and
jung
in
that
the
function
of
dreams
is
not
to
deliver
wish
fulfilment
whilst
keeping
the
individual
asleep
or
to
connect
an
individual
to
the
symbolism
of
the
collective
unconscious
.
revonsuo
strives
to
deliver
an
account
that
meets
the
stringent
criteria
of
a
scientific
explanation
of
the
adaptation
of
dreaming
.
though
there
have
been
many
attempts
to
explain
dreaming
as
an
adaptation
,
few
come
close
to
the
ideal
adaptation
explanation
,
and
those
functional
theories
favoured
by
neurocognitive
scientists
(
for
example
,
dreams
are
for
consolidating
memories
or
for
forgetting
useless
information
)
cannot
clearly
distinguish
their
theory
of
the
function
of
dreams
from
the
function
of
sleep
,
that
is
,
the
spandrel
thesis
.
the
threat
simulation
theory
account
can
be
clearly
distinguished
from
the
spandrel
thesis
.

according
to
revonsuo
,
the
actual
content
of
dreams
is
helpful
to
the
survival
of
an
organism
because
dreaming
enhances
behaviours
in
waking
life
such
as
perceiving
and
avoiding
threat
.
revonsuo



s
threat
simulation
theory
presents
dreams
as
specializing
in
the
recreation
of
life-like
threatening
scenarios
.
his
six
claims
are
as
follows
:
claim
1
:
dream
experience
is
more
an
organized
state
of
mind
than
disorganized
;
claim
2
:
dreaming
is
tailored
to
and
biased
toward
simulating
threatening
events
of
all
kinds
found
in
waking
life
;
claim
3
:
genuine
threats
experienced
in
waking
life
have
a
profound
effect
on
subsequent
dreaming
;
claim
4
:
dreams
provide
realistic
simulacra
of
waking
life
threatening
scenarios
and
waking
consciousness
generally
;
claim
5
:
simulation
of
perceptual
and
motor
activities
leads
to
enhanced
performance
even
when
the
rehearsal
is
not
recalled
later
;
claim
6
:
dreaming
has
been
selected
for
(
revonsuo
,
2000
)
.

the
threat
simulation
theory
is
committed
to
a
certain
conception
of
dreams
as
a
realistic
and
organized
state
of
consciousness
,
as
implied
by
claim
1
.
this
claim
motivates
the
challenge
to
any
spandrel
thesis
of
dreams
by
asking
why
dreams
would
show
the
level
of
organization
that
they
do
,
namely
,
the
construction
and
engagement
of
virtual
realities
,
if
they
were
just
mere


mental
noise



as
a
spandrel
thesis
might
imply
or
be
committed
to
.
dreaming
is
allegedly
similar
to
waking
life
and
is
indeed
experienced
as
waking
life
at
least
at
the
time
of
the
dream
(
valli
&
revonsuo
,
2009
:
p
.
18
)
.
these
features
of
dreams
are
essential
in
putting
in
motion
the
same
sort
of
reaction
to
threat
that
will
occur
during
waking
life
and
aid
survival
.
hence
the
dream
self
should
be
able
to
react
in
the
dream
situation
with
reasonable
courses
of
action
to
combat
the
perceived
threat
in
ways
that
would
also
be
appropriate
in
real
life
.
revonsuo
appeals
to
phenomenological
data
where
a
significant
proportion
of
dreams
involve
situations
in
which
the
dreamer
comes
under
attack
.
we
do
indeed
generally
have
more
negative
emotions
during
an
rem
related
dream
.
this
claim
is
well
supported
by
experiential
examples
of
dreaming
,
where
anxiety
is
the
most
frequent
emotion
in
dreaming
,
joy/
elation
was
second
and
anger
third
(
hobson
,
1994
:
p
.
157
)
,
making
two
thirds
of
dream
emotion
negative
.
that
dreams
process
negative
emotions
likely
occurs
because
the
amygdala
is
highly
activated
.
the
amygdala
is
also
the
key
brain
part
implicated
in
the


fight
or
flight



sympathetic
nervous
system
response
to
especially
intense
life-threatening
situations
.
during
waking
hours
this
part
of
the
brain
is
used
in
handling
unpleasant
emotions
like
anxiety
,
intense
fear
or
anger
.
this
is
well
explained
by
the
threat
simulation
theory
.
we
experience
more
threats
in
dreams
(
and
especially
demanding
ones
)
than
in
waking
life
because
it
is
selected
to
be
especially
difficult
,
leaving
the
individual
bestowed
with
a
surplus
of
successful
threat
avoidance
strategies
,
coping
skills
and
abilities
to
anticipate
,
detect
and
out-manoeuvre
the
subtleties
of
certain
threats
.

though
revonsuo
claims
that
dreams
specialize
in
the
full
panoply
of
threatening
scenarios
that
will
effect
overall
survival
,
the
most
obvious
example
is
the


fight
or
flight



response
.
all
instances
of
stress
in
waking
life
occur
when
an
individual
feels
threatened
and
this
will
feed
back
into
the
system
of
acknowledging
what
is
dangerous
and
what
is
not
.
in
waking
life
,
the
fight
or
flight
response
essentially
involves
making
a
snap
decision
in
a
life
or
death
situation
to
fight
a
predatory
enemy
or
flee
from
the
scene
.
the
activation
of
the
sympathetic
nervous
system



the
stress
response
implicated
in
the
fight
or
flight
response



is
an
involuntary
,
unconsciously
initiated
process
.
one
might
object
to
claims
1
and
4
,
that
many
dreams
simply
do
not
seem
realistic
representations
of
threatening
scenarios
such
as
those
requiring
the
fight
or
flight
response
.
one
study
found
,
for
example
,
that
many
recurrent
dreams
are
unrealistic
(
zadra
et
al
,
2006
)
.
revonsuo
has
some
scope
for
manoeuvre
for
he
believes
that
dreams
may
no
longer
be
adaptive
due
to
the
dramatic
environmental
changes
,
and
the
possible
adaptation
for
human
dream
consciousness
was
when
humans
were
hunter-gatherers
in
the
pleistocene
environment
over
a
period
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
;
so
dream
content
may
now
no
longer
seem
to
have
the
same
function
,
given
that
we
live
in
a
radically
different
environment
.

dreams
are
then
comparable
to
the
human
appendix



useful
and
adaptive
in
times
when
our
diet
was
radically
different
,
but
now
an
essentially
redundant
and
,
occasionally
,
maladaptive
vestigial
trait
.

dreams
may
have
also
become
more
lax
in
representing
threatening
content
in
the
western
world
,
since
life
and
death
threatening
situations
are
no
longer
anywhere
near
as
common
as
in
the
evolutionary
past
.
this
will
be
the
case
because
a
lack
of
exposure
to
threat
in
waking
life
will
not
activate
the
threat
simulation
system
of
dreaming
as
it
did
in
earlier
times
.
revonsuo
uses
evidence
of
ordinary
dream
reports
from
the
population
but
he
also
cites
cases
of
psychopathology
such
as
the
dreams
of
individuals
with
post-traumatic
stress
disorder
(
ptsd
)
,
where
,
crucially
,
their
traumatic
and
threatening
experiences
dramatically
affects
what
they
dream
about
.
thus
the
relationship
between
dreaming
and
experiencing
threats
in
waking
life
is
bi-directional
:
dreams
try
to
anticipate
the
possible
threats
of
waking
life
and
improve
the
speed
of
perceiving
and
ways
of
reacting
to
them
.

at
the
same
time
,
any
perceived
threats
that
are
actually
experienced
in
waking
life
will
alter
the
course
of
later
dreaming
to
re-simulate
those
threats
perceived
.
this
feedback
element
dovetails
with
claim
4
for
an
accurate
picture
will
be
built
as
information
is
constructed
from
the
real
world
.

perhaps
the
updating
element
of
the
threat
simulation
theory
(
claim
4



that
individuals
learn
from
what
is
threatening
and
this
gets
passed
onto
offspring
)
suffers
from
the
same
accusation
of
lamarckism
that
faces
jung



s
theory
.
revonsuo
believes
that
dreaming
during
sleep
allows
an
individual
to
repetitively
rehearse
the
neurocognitive
mechanisms
that
are
indispensable
to
waking
life
threat
perception
and
avoidance
.
flanagan
asks
why
behaviour
that
is
instinctual
would
need
to
be
repetitively
rehearsed
,
but
what
is
provided
by
revonsuo
is
an
explanation
of
how
instinct
is
actually
preserved
in
animals
.
but
not
all
of
our
dreams
are
threatening
.
this
fact
surely
helps
the
threat
simulation
theory
to
show
that
there
is
variation
amongst
the
trait
and
that
the
threatening
type
comes
to
dominate
.
the
neural
mechanisms
,
or
hardware
,
underlying
the
ability
to
dream
are
transferred
genetically
and
became
common
in
the
population
.
those
individuals
with
an
insufficient
number
of
threatening
dreams
were
not
able
to
survive
to
pass
on
the
trait
because
they
were
left
ill
prepared
for
the
trials
and
tribulations
of
the
real
world



s
evolutionary
environment
.
one
might
still
object
that
survival



the
avoidance
of
threat



is
only
one
half
of
propagating
a
trait
.
individuals
also
have
to
reproduce
for
the
trait
to
be
passed
on
.
so
dreams
ought
to
also
specialize
in
enhancing
behaviours
that
help
individuals
to
find
mates
.
animals
and
humans
have
many
and
varied
courting
rituals
,
requiring
complicated
behaviours
if
dreaming
can
,
and
does
,
make
any
difference
to
behaviour
in
waking
life
as
revonsuo
must
claim
,
then
why
would
the
presence
of
mate
selection
behaviours
not
make
up
a
big
factor
in
dreams
?
in
humans
,
no
more
than
6%
of
adult
dreams
contain
direct
sexual
themes
(
flanagan
,
2000
:
p
.
149
)
.
there
is
also
a
slight
gender
difference
in
that
males
tend
to
dream
more
of
male
characters
than
female
characters
.
given
that
many
threats
would
have
occurred
from
same
sex
individuals
within
one



s
own
species
,
this
fares
well
for
the
claim
that
dreams
are
for
threat
perception
and
rehearsal
,
but
not
for
courtship
rituals
that
could
help
pass
on
the
trait
.
there
are
ways
around
this
objection
,
however
.
threatening
and
sexual
encounters
are
such
polar
opposites
that
different
parts
of
the
nervous
system
deal
with
them



the
sympathetic
and
parasympathetic



dramatically
alternating
between
the
two
could
potentially
disrupt
sleep
.
clearly
,
simply
surviving
is
prioritized
over
reproducing

dreaming
in
contemporary
philosophy
of
mind
and
consciousness
a
.
should
dreaming
be
a
scientific
model
?

visual
awareness
has
been
used
as
the
model
system
in
consciousness
research
.
it
is
easy
to
manipulate
and
investigate
.
humans
are
predominantly
visual
creatures
and
so
visual
awareness
is
an
excellent
paradigm
of
conscious
experience
,
at
least
for
humans
.
a
good
example
of
the
virtues
of
using
paradigm
cases
to
study
,
from
biological
science
,
is
drosophila
melanogaster
(
the
common
fruit
fly
)
.
this
organism
is
often
used
in
experiments
and
routinely
cited
in
papers
detailing
experiments
or
suggesting
further
research
.
a
scientific
model
is
a
practical
necessity
and
the
fruit
fly
has
such
a
fast
reproduction
rate
that
it
allows
geneticists
to
see
the
effects
of
genes
over
many
generations
that
they
would
not
see
in
their
own
lifetime
in
,
say
,
humans
.
the
fruit
fly
also
has
enough
genetic
similarity
to
humans
such
that
the
findings
can
be
extrapolated
.
hence
,
a
model
system
has
something
special
about
it



some
ideal
set
of
features
for
empirically
investigating
.
model
systems
are
good
because
they
ideally
also
display
the
phenomena
being
investigated
in
an


exceptionally
prominent
form



(
revonsuo
,
2006
:
p

73-74
)
.

i
.
dreaming
as
a
model
of
consciousness
revonsuo
(
2006
)
argues
that
dreaming
should
also
have
a
place
alongside
visual
awareness
,
as
a
special
instance
of
consciousness
and
therefore
a
worthy
model
to
be
studied
.
revonsuo
argues
that
the
dreaming
brain
also
captures
consciousness
in
a


theoretically
interesting
form



(
revonsuo
,
2006
:
p
.
73
)
.
the
claim
is
that
dreaming
is
an
unusually
rare
example
of


pure



consciousness
,
being
as
it
is
devoid
of
ongoing
perceptual
input
and
therefore
might
deserve
special
status
in
being
scientifically
investigated
.
the
system
is
entirely
dependent
on
internal
resources
(
metzinger
,
2003
:
p
.
255
)
and
is
isolated
from
the
external
world
.
representational
content
changes
much
quicker
than
in
the
waking
state
,
and
this
is
why
metzinger
claims
that
dreams
are
more
dynamic
(
metzinger
,
2003
:
p
.
255
)
.
whereas
malcolm
and
dennett
had
argued
that
dreams
are
not
even
plausibly
conscious
states
,
revonsuo
and
metzinger
argue
that
dreams
may
reveal
the
very
essence
of
consciousness
because
of
the
conditions
under
which
dream
consciousness
takes
place
.
crucially
,
there
is
a
blockade
of
sensory
input
.
only
very
rarely
will
sensory
input
contribute
to
information
processing
during
dreaming
,
(
metzinger
,
2003
:
p
.
257
)
for
example
in
dreams
where
the
sound
of
the
alarm
clock
is
interwoven
into
a
narrative
involving
wedding
bells
.
this
means
that
most
other
dreams
are


epistemically
empty



with
regard
to
the
external
environment
.
at
no
other
time
is
consciousness
completely
out
of
synch
with
the
environment
,
and
,
so
to
speak
,
left
to
its
own
devices
.
dreaming
is
especially
interesting
and
fundamentally
similar
to
waking
consciousness
because
it
entails
consciousness
of
a
world
which
we
take
to
be
the
real
one
,
just
as
we
do
during
waking
consciousness
.


only
rarely
do
we
realize
during
the
dream
that
it
is
only
a
dream
.
the
estimated
frequency
of
lucid
dreams
varies
in
different
studies
.
approximately
1
to
10%
of
dream
reports
include
the
lucidity
and
about
60%
of
the
population
have
experienced
a
lucid
dream
at
least
once
in
their
lifetime
(
farthing
,
1992
;
snyder
&
gackenbach
,
1988
)
.
thus
,
as
many
as
90
to
99%
of
dreams
are
completely
non-lucid
,
so
that
the
dream
world
is
taken
for
real
by
the
dreamer



(
revonsuo
,
2006
:
p
.
83
)
.

revonsuo
does
not
so
much
argue
for
the
displacement
of
visual
awareness
qua
a
model
system
,
as
arguing
that
dreaming
is
another
exemplary
token
of
consciousness
.
dreaming
,
unlike
visual
awareness
,
is
both
untainted
by
the
external
world
and
behavioural
activity
(
revonsuo
,
2006
:
p
.
75
)
.
dreams
also
reveal
the
especially
subjective
nature
of
consciousness
:
the
creation
of
a


world-for-me



.

another
reason
that
might
motivate
modelling
dreaming
is
that
it
might
turn
out
to
be
a
good
instance
for
looking
at
the
problem
of
localization
in
consciousness
research
.
for
example
,
during
dreaming
the
phenomenology
is
demonstrably
not
ontologically
dependent
on
any
process
missing
during
dreaming
.
any
parts
of
the
brain
not
used
in
dreaming
can
be
ruled
out
as
not
being
necessary
to
phenomenal
consciousness
(
revonsuo
,
2006
:
p
.
87
)
.

during
dreams
there
is
an
output
blockade
(
revonsuo
,
2006
:
p
.
87
;
metzinger
,
2003
:
p
.
257
)
,
making
dreaming
an
especially
pure
and
isolated
system
.
malcolm
had
argued
that
dreaming
was
worthy
of
no
further
empirical
work
for
the
notion
was
simply
incoherent
,
and
dennett
was
sceptical
that
dreams
would
turn
out
to
even
involve
consciousness
.
the
radical
proposal
now
is
that
dreaming
ought
to
be
championed
as
an
example
of
conscious
experience
,
a
mascot
for
scientific
investigation
in
consciousness
studies
.
it
is
alleged
that
dreams
can
recapitulate
any
experience
from
waking
life
and
for
this
reason
revonsuo
concludes
that
the
same
physical
or
neural
realization
of
consciousness
is
instantiated
in
both
examples
of
dreaming
and
waking
experience
(
revonsuo
,
2006
:
p
.
86
)
.

ii
.
dreaming
as
a
contrast
case
for
waking
consciousness
the
argument
of
windt
&
noreika
(
2011
)
firstly
lays
out
the
alleged
myriad
of
problems
with
taking
dreaming
as
a
scientific
model
in
consciousness
research
and
then
proposes
positive
suggestions
for
the
role
dreaming
can
play
in
consciousness
studies
.
they
reject
dreaming
as
a
model
system
but
suggest
it
will
work
better
as
a
contrast
system
to
wakefulness
.
the
first
major
problem
with
using
dreaming
as
a
model
of
consciousness
is
that
,
whilst
,
for
example
,
in
biology
everybody
knows
what
the
fruit
fly
is
,
there
are
a
number
of
different
conceptions
and
debates
surrounding
key
features
and
claims
about
dreaming
.
hence
there
is
no
accepted
definition
of
dreaming
(
windt
,
2010
:
p
.
296
)
.
taking
dreaming
as
a
model
system
of
course
requires
and
depends
upon
exactly
what
dreaming
is
characterized
as
.
revonsuo
simply
assumes
his
conception
of
dreaming
is
correct
.
he
believes
that
dreaming
can
be
a
model
of
waking
consciousness
because
dreams
can
be
identical
replicas
of
waking
consciousness
involving
all
possible
experiences
.
windt
&
noreika
believe
that
dreams
tend
to
be
different
to
waking
life
in
important
ways
.

there
are
further
problems
with
modelling
dreams
.
collecting
dream
reports
in
the
laboratory
might
amount
to
about
five
reported
dreams
a
night
.
this
is
not
practical
at
all
compared
to
visual
awareness
where
hundreds
of
reportable
experiences
can
occur
in
minutes
without
interference
(
windt
&
noreika
,
2011
:
p
.
1099
)
.
scientists
do
not
even
directly
work
with
dreams
themselves
,
but
rather
descriptions
of
dreams
.
there
is
also
the
added
possibility
of
narrative
fabrication
(
the
difference
between
dream
experience
and
dream
report
)
.
during
the
dream
itself
,
it
is
known
that
we
do
not
have
clarity
of
awareness
as
in
waking
life
and
we
do
have
a
poor
memory
during
the
dream
experience
.
though
lucid
dreaming
is
an
exception
to
this
rule
,
it
differs
from
ordinary
dreaming
and
lucid
dreaming
has
not
been
proposed
as
a
model
.
the
laboratory
is
needed
to
control
and
measure
the
phenomenon
properly
but
this
in
itself
can
influence
the
dream
content
and
report
and
so
the
observer
effect
and
interviewer
biases
are
introduced
.

it
is
not
clear
that
these
are
insurmountable
methodological
problems
.

it
might
be
very
difficult
to
investigate
dreams
but
this
comes
with
the
territory
of
trying
to
investigate
isolated
consciousness
.
revonsuo
is
also
not
suggesting
removing
visual
awareness
as
the
paradigm
model
,
only
that
dreaming
ought
to
be
alongside
it
.
the
fact
remains
,
however
,
that
despite
suggestions
from
revonsuo
and
others
,
dreaming
being
used
as
a
model
has
simply
not
yet
taken
place
(
windt
&
noreika
,
2011
:
p
.
1091
)
,
regardless
of
the
theoretical
incentives
.

the
problems
with
the
modelling
approach
point
us
toward
the
more
modest
contrast
analysis
approach
.
windt
&
noreika
argue
that
the
contrast
analysis
of
dreaming
with
other
wake
states
should
at
least
be
the
first
step
in
scientific
investigation
,
even
if
we
wanted
to
establish
what
ought
to
be
a
model
in
consciousness
research
(
windt
,
2011
:
p
.
1102
)
.
what
are
the
reasons
for
endorsing
the
positive
proposal
of
using
dreams
in
a
contrast
analysis
with
waking
life
?
though
waking
consciousness
is
the
default
mode
through
which
individuals
experience
the
world
,
dreaming
is
the
second
global
state
of
consciousness
.
as
displayed
in
reports
,
dreams
involve
features
which
are
markedly
different
to
that
of
waking
life



bizarreness
and
confabulation
being
key
hallmarks
of
dreaming
but
not
waking
consciousness
.
the
two
states
of
waking
and
dreaming
are
mediated
by
radically
different
neurochemical
systems
.
during
wakefulness
,
the
aminergic
system
is
predominantly
in
control
and
for
dreaming
the
cholinergic
system
takes
over
(
hobson
,
1994
:
pp
.
14-15
;
hobson
,
2005
:

.

)
.
this
fundamental
difference
offers
an
opportunity
to
examine
the
neurology
and
neurochemistry
that
underpins
both
states
of
consciousness
.
the
contrast
analysis
does
not
ignore
dreaming
,
but
proposes
a
more
modest
approach
.
with
research
divided
between
waking
consciousness
,
dreaming
and
a
comparison
of
the
two
states
,
this
more
practical
approach
will
yield
better
results
,
so
windt
and
noreika
argue
.
by
using
the
proposed
method
,
we
can
see
how
consciousness
works
both
with
and
without
environmental
input
.
surely
both
are
as
equally
important
as
each
other
,
rather
than
trying
to
find
reason
to
privilege
one
over
the
other
.
after
all
,
both
are
genuine
examples
of
consciousness
.
this
approach
also
means
that
the
outcome
will
be
mutually
informative
as
regards
the
two
types
of
consciousness
with
insights
gained
in
both
directions
.
it
is
important
to
compare
dreaming
as
an
important
example
of
consciousness
operating
with
radically
changed
neural
processing
to
waking
consciousness
(
windt
&
noreika
,
2011
:
p
.
1101
)
.
with
the
contrastive
analysis
there
is
the
prospect
of
comparing
dream
consciousness
to
both
pathological
and
non-pathology
waking
states
,
and
there
is
thereby
the
promise
of
better
understanding
how
waking
consciousness
works
and
how
it
can
also
malfunction
.
we
spend
about
a
tenth
of
our
conscious
lives
dreaming
,
and
yet
it
is
one
of
the
most
difficult
mental
states
to
scientifically
investigate
.
the
contrast
analysis
is
put
forward
as
a
possible
solution
to
the
problem
of
how
to
integrate
dreams
into
consciousness
studies
.
windt
and
noreika
add
the
further
proposal
that
dreams
can
be
more
specifically
contrasted
with
pathological
,
non-pathological
and
altered
states
of
consciousness
.

unlike
the
modelling
option
,
the
contrast
analysis
seems
to
be
how
dreams
have
been
hitherto
investigated
and
so
has
already
proven
to
be
a
viable
option
.
this
should
not
definitively
preclude
the
modelling
option
,
however
.
perhaps
modelling
dreams
really
would
be
ideal
simply
because
it
involves
isolated
consciousness
and
the
practicality
concerns
may
be
overcome
in
the
future
.

it
remains
the
case
that


one
of
the
central
desiderata
in
the
field
of
empirical
dream
research
is
a
commonly
accepted
definition
of
dreaming



(
windt
,
2010
:
p
.
296
)
.
there
are
also
examples
of
consciousness
at
the
periphery
of
sleep
that
makes
it
difficult
to
delineate
the
boundaries
of
what
does
and
does
not
count
as
a
dream
(
mavromatis
,
1987
:
p
.
3
;


hypnagogic



experiences
are
the
thoughts
,
images
or
quasi-hallucinations
that
occur
prior
to
and
during
sleep
onset
whilst


hypnopompic



experiences
are
thoughts
,
images
or
quasi-hallucinations
that
occur
during
or
just
after
waking
;
these
states
are
now
known
collectively
as
hypnagogia
)
.
this
is
a
problem
that
both
the
modelling
and
the
contrast
analysis
approach
both
must
confront
.

b
.
is
dreaming
an
instance
of
images
or
percepts
?

some
believe
that
dreaming
involves
mental
imagery
of
both
hallucinatory
and
imagistic
nature
(
symons
:
1993
:
p
.
185
;
seligman
&
yellen
,
1987
)
.
however
,
other
philosophers
such
as
colin
mcginn
believe
that
dreams
should
only
be
thought
of
in
terms
of
images
(
the
imagination
)
or
percepts
(
perceptual
experience
)
.
it
is
better
to
not
inflate
our
ontology
and
invoke
a
third
category
that
dreams
are
sui
generis
(
of
their
own
kind
)
if
we
do
not
need
to
.
there
are
reasons
why
we
should
not
believe
dreams
are
a
unique
mental
state
.
it
would
be
strange
,
mcginn
claims
,
if


the
faculties
recruited
in
dreaming
were
not
already
exploited
during
waking
life



(
mcginn
,
2004
:
p
.
75
)
.
so
he
believes
that
dreaming
is
an
instance
of
a
psychological
state
we
are
already
familiar
with
from
waking
life
:
perception
(
hallucination
)
or
the
imagination
.
there
is
a
separate
epistemic
question
of
whether
dreams
involve
beliefs
or
imaginings
(
ichikawa
,
2009
)
.
this
debate
comes
apart
from
the
psychological
one
as
to
whether
the
phenomenology
of
dreaming
is
percept
or
imagining
because
all
four
possible
combinations
can
be
held
:
a
theorist
might
claim
that
dreams
are
hallucination
which
involve
belief
;
another
theorist
might
claim
that
dreams
involve
hallucinations
which
we
do
not
generate
belief
,
but
we
are
rather
always
entertaining
our
dream
hallucinations
as
imagined
possibilities
.
alternatively
,
dreams
might
involve
the
psychological
state
of
the
imagination
and
yet
we
happen
to
believe
in
our
imaginings
as
though
they
were
real
;
finally
,
dreams
might
involve
imaginings
which
we
recognize
as
such
,
imaginings
and
not
beliefs
.
though
the
two
debates
come
apart
,
in
waking
life
the
psychological
state
of
imagining
is
usually
accompanied
by
the
propositional
attitude
of
imagining
that
something
is
the
case
,
rather
than
believing
that
the
something
(
psychologically
imagined
)
is
the
case
.
perception
,
or
hallucination
,
usually
triggers
belief
that
what
is
perceived
is
the
case
,
rather
than
merely
imagining
that
what
is
perceived
is
the
case
.
so
if
dreams
are
psychologically
defined
in
terms
of
percepts
,
we
can
expect
that
dreams
likely
also
involve
belief
because
percepts
usually
trigger
belief
.

this
is
not
always
the
case
,
however
.
for
example
,
a
schizophrenic
might
come
to
realize
that
his
hallucinations
do
not
really
express
a
way
the
world
is
and
so
no
longer
believe
what
he
perceives
.
if
dreams
are
propositionally
imagined
,
then
we
would
usually
expect
our
imaginings
to
be
recognized
as
not
being
real
and
therefore
triggering
the
propositional
attitude
of
imagining
rather
than
believing
that
what
we
are
imaging
(
in
the
psychological
sense
)
that
something
is
the
case
.

there
are
more
nuanced
views
than
the
four
possible
combinations
.

mcginn
claims
that
dreaming
involves
the
imagination
and
quasi-belief
.

when
we
dream
we
are
immersed
in
the
fictional
plot
,
as
we
are
in
creative
writing
or
film
.

i
.
dreaming
as
hallucination
it
is
worth
noting
that
the
psychological
literature
assumes
that
dreams
are
hallucinations
that
occur
during
sleep
.
it
is
the
typically
unquestioned
psychological
orthodoxy
that
dreams
are
perceptual/
hallucinatory
experiences
.
evidence
can
be
cited
for
dreams
as
percepts
from
neuroscience
:
the
offline
world
simulation
engages
the
same
brain
mechanisms
as
perceptual
consciousness
and
seems
real
to
us
because
we
are
unaware
that
it
is
nothing
but
a
hallucination
(
except
very
rarely
in
lucid
dreams
)
.
(
valli
&
revonsuo
,
2009
:
p
.
19
)
in
rem
sleep
,
when
we
are
lying
still
due
to
muscle
paralysis
,
the
motor
programs
of
the
brain
are
nonetheless
active
.
phenomenologically
,
our
dream
selves
are
also
highly
active
during
dreams
.
as
the
content
of
a
dream
reveals
,
we
are
always
on
the
move
.
apart
from
the
bodily
paralysis
,
physiologically
the
body
acts
as
though
it
perceives
a
real
world
,
and
continually
reacting
to
events
in
that
apparently
real
world
.
it
is
known
that
individuals
will
carry
out
their
dream
actions
if
the
nerve
cells
that
suppress
movement
are
surgically
removed
or
have
deteriorated
due
to
age
,
as
demonstrated
in
people
with
rem
sleep
behavior
disorder
.
this
suggests
that
dreaming
involves
the
ordinary
notion
of
belief
because
it
is
tied
to
action
in
the
usual
way
and
it
is
only
because
of
an
additional
action-suppressing
part
of
the
brain
that
these
actions
are
not
carried
out
.
we
know
that
percepts
ordinarily
trigger
belief
and
corresponding
action
,
whereas
the
imagination
does
not
.

the
claim
that
dreams
are
hallucinations
can
find
support
in
the
further
claim
that
dreaming
replicates
waking
consciousness
.
many
philosophers
and
psychologists
make
note
of
the
realistic
and
organized
nature
of
dreams
,
and
this
has
been
couched
in
terms
of
a
virtual
reality
,
involving
a
realistic
representation
of
the
bodily
self
which
we
can
feel
.
consider
false
awakenings
,
where
an
individual
believes
they
have
woken
up
in
the
very
place
they
went
to
sleep
,
yet
they
are
actually
still
asleep
in
dreaming
.
false
awakenings
can
arguably
be
used
in
support
of
the
view
that
dreaming
is
hallucinatory
because
such
dreams
detail
a
realistic
depiction
of
one



s
surroundings
.
dreams
fit
the
philosophical
concept
of
hallucination
as
an
experience
intrinsically
similar
to
legitimate
perceptual
states
with
the
difference
that
the
apparent
stimulus
being
perceived
is
non-existent
(
windt
,
2010
:
pp
.
298-299
)
.
it
is
the
job
of
perceptual
states
to
display
the
self
in
a
world
.

empirical
evidence
suggests
that
pain
can
be
experienced
in
dreams
,
which
is
perceptual
in
nature
and
which
the
imagination
can
arguably
not
replicate
.
so
dreams
must
be
hallucinatory
,
according
to
this
line
of
reasoning
.
it
is
not
clear
though
whether
this
rules
out
dreams
as
mainly
imaginative
with
occasional
perceptual
elements
introduced
.
pain
is
,
after
all
,
a
rarity
in
dreaming
.

we
can
plausibly
speculate
that
human
ancestors
fell
prey
to
a
major
metaphysical
confusion
and
thought
that
their
dreams
involved
genuine
experiences
in
the
past
,
including
visitations
from
the
dead
and
entering
a
different
realm
.
though
few
believe
this
today
,
we
can
sympathize
with
our
ancestors



mistake
which
is
further
supported
by
the
occasional
everyday
feeling
where
we
can
be
hesitant
to
categorize
a
memory
of
an
experience
as
a
dream
or
a
waking
event
.
we
usually
decide
,
not
based
on
introspection
,
but
on
logical
discrepancies
between
the
memory
and
other
factors
.
these
two
reasons
suggest
that
we
cannot
always
easily
distinguish
between
dream
experience
and
waking
experience
,
because
they
are
another
instance
of
percepts
.

finally
,
we
seem
to
have
real
emotions
during
dreams
which
are
the
natural
reaction
to
our
perceptions
.
according
to
the
percept
view
of
dreams
,
we
dream
that
we
are
carrying
actions
out
in
an
environment
,
but
our
accompanying
emotions
are
not
dreamed
and
play
out
alongside
the
rest
of
the
dream
content
.
the
intensity
of
the
emotions
,
actually
felt
,
is
what
the
percept
theorist
will
take
as
support
for
the
content
of
the
dream
not
being
merely
imagined
,
but
the
natural
response
of
realistic
,
perceptual-like
experience
.

ii
.
dreaming
as
imagination
a
number
of
philosophers
believe
that
dreaming
is
just
the
imagination
at
work
during
sleep
(
ichikawa
,
2008
;
sosa
,
2007
;
mcginn
,
2004
,
2005
)
.

any
conscious
experiences
during
sleep
are
imagistic
rather
than
perceptual
.
mcginn
puts
forward
some
reasons
in
favour
of
believing
that
dreams
are
imaginings
.
firstly
,
he
introduces
the
observational
attitude
:
if
we
are
perceiving
(
or
hallucinating
)
,
say
,
two
individuals
having
a
conversation
then
we
might
need
to
strain
our
senses
to
hear
or
see
what
they
are
discussing
.
during
dreams
of
course
,
the
body
is
completely
relaxed
and
the
sleeping
individual
shows
no
interest
in
his
or
her
surroundings
.
when
imagining
in
waking
life
,
i
try
to
minimize
my
sensory
awareness
of
the
surrounding
environment
in
order
to
get
a
better
and
more
vivid
picture
of
what
it
is
i
am
imagining
.
for
example
,
if
i
want
to
imagine
a
new
musical
tune
,
i
do
best
to
switch
the
radio
off
or
cover
my
ears
.
dreaming
is
the
natural
instance
of
shutting
out
all
of
our
sensory
awareness
of
the
outside
world
,
arguably
to
entirely
engage
the
imagination
.
this
suggests
that
the
dreamer
is
hearing
with
their
mind



s
ear
and
seeing
with
their
mind



s
eye
.
they
are
entertaining
images
,
not
percepts
.
secondly
,
mcginn
claims
that
percepts
and
images
can
coexist
in
the
mind
in
waking
life
.

we
can
perceive
at
the
same
time
as
imagining
.
the
novel
presupposes
that
the
reader
can
perceive
the
text
at
the
same
time
as
imagining
its
content
.
it
ought
to
be
possible
,
mcginn
argues
,
that
if
dreams
are
hallucinatory
,
we
should
be
able
to
imagine
at
the
same
time
.
if
i
am
surfing
in
a
dream
,
i
should
be
able
to
imagine
the
eiffel
tower
at
the
same
time
.
in
dreams
we
cannot
do
this
,
there
is
just
the
dream
,
mcginn
claims
,
with
no
further
ability
to
simultaneously
imagine
other
content
.
related
to
the
observational
stance
is
the
notion
of
recognition
in
dreams
.
in
dreams
we
seem
to
already
know
who
all
of
the
characters
are
,
without
making
any
effort
to
find
out
who
they
are
(
without
using
any
of
our
senses
)
.
this
might
suggest
that
in
dreams
we
are
partly
in
control
of
the
content
(
even
if
we
fail
to
realize
it
)
because
we
allegedly
summon
up
the
characters
that
we
want
to
.
we
recognize
who
dream
characters
are
,
such
as
relatives
,
even
when
they
look
drastically
different
.
it
is
not
clear
,
on
the
other
hand
,
that
we
really
are
in
control
of
other
dream
characters
and
that
we
accurately
recognize
them
,
for
example
,
gerrans
(
2012
)
has
claimed
that
the
same
mechanism
of
misidentification
is
present
in
dreams
as
in
certain
delusional
states
where
the
feeling
of
familiarity
of
a
person
is
over-active
and
aimed
at
the
wrong
individuals
(
as
in
fregoli
delusion
)
.
on
this
view
,
we
do
not
accurately
bring
to
mind
certain
dream
characters
,
we
try
to
identify
them
and
make
mistakes
.
this
would
be
an
alternative
way
of
accommodating
the
evidence
.

in
the
1940



s
and
1950



s
,
a
survey
found
that
a
majority
of
americans
thought
that
their
own
dreams
,
and
dreams
more
generally
,
occurred
in
black
and
white
.
crucially
,
people
have
thought
prior
to
and
after
this
period
that
dreams
occur
in
colour
.
this
period
coincided
with
the
advent
of
black
and
white
television
.
according
to
schwitzgebel
,
the
most
reasonable
conclusion
to
draw
is
that
dreams
are
more
like
imagining
written
fiction
,
sketchy
and
without
any
colour
;
i
can
read
a
novel
without
summoning
any
definite
imagery
to
mind
(
schwitzgebel
,
2002
:
p
.
656
)
.
perhaps
this
is
akin
to
reading
a
novel
quickly
and
forming
vague
and
indefinite
imagery
.
ichikawa
also
argues
that
dreaming
involves
only
images
and
is
indeterminate
to
colour
because
images
can
be
indeterminate
to
colour
,
but
to
hallucinate
would
require
some
determinacy
in
colour
,
whether
black
and
white
or
in
full
colour
crucially
,
even
outside
of
schwitzgebel



s
findings
,
people
have
raised
the
question
whether
we
dream
in
colour
or
black
and
white



something
needs
to
explain
the
very
possibility
of
such
a
dispute
;


the
imagination
model
may
provide
the
best
explanation
for
disagreement
about
colour
sensation
in
dreams



(
ichikawa
,
2009
:
p
.
109
)
.
mcginn
also
believes
that
dreams
can
be
indeterminate
to
colour
,
and
they
can
be
coloured
in
during
the
waking
report
,
which
can
be
affected
by
the
current
media
.

kamitani

outline
some
research
into

purely

what
individuals
can
consciously
see
.
the
speculative
idea
is
that
eventually
the
method
discussed
might
be
applied
to
dreaming
and
scientists
will
thereby
be
able
to


record

in
our
dreams
,
we
typically
don



t
question
bizarre
phenomena
,
like
losing
all
our
teeth
or
being
chased
by
giant
orange
snakes
.
we
accept
the
strange
reality
of
our
dream
worlds
,
unable
to
find
a
reasonable
explanation
or
solution
.

that



s
because
during
sleep
,
we
lose
the
ability
to
reflect
critically
on
our
own
thoughts
and
analyses
,
a
process
known
as
metacognition
.
but
sometimes
,
something
tips
us
off
.
it
suddenly
becomes
clear



we
don



t
normally
go
to
school
in
a
giant
dripping
cave
or
have
the
ability
to
fly
,
and
we
realize
:
this
is
a
dream
.

the
state
of
recognizing
you
are
dreaming
is
known
as
lucid
dreaming
.

in
neuroscience
terms
,
this
happens
when
your
capacity
for
metacognition
comes
back
online
.
you



re
able
to
examine
your
beliefs
in
the
moment
and
assess
whether
the
conclusions
you



re
drawing



like


my
school
is
a
cave



or


i
was
always
able
to
fly






jibe
with
reality
.



the
mind
is
quite
restricted
during
sleep
and
dreaming
,
but
lucid
dreaming
is
the
exception
.
our
reflective
capability
can
be
as
strong
and
intact
as
it
is
during
wakefulness
,



said
martin
dresler
,
principal
investigator
at
the
donders
sleep
&
memory
lab
at
radboud
university
in
the
netherlands
.

for
the
most
part
,
we
can
'
t
consciously
choose
what
we
dream
about
.
but
actively
recognizing
you
are
dreaming
creates
the
opportunity
for
varying
levels
of
dream
control
.
advanced
lucid
dreamers
can
alter
the
plot
of
their
dreams
,
transform
themselves
into
animals
or
other
people
,
change
their
environment
,
and
distort
the
laws
of
physics
.

most
people
lucid
dream
just
a
few
times
in
their
lifetime
,
if
at
all
.

and
even
if
they
gain
an
awareness
of
their
dream
state
,
it



s
even
more
rare
to
be
able
to
actively
control
their
dream
content
in
real
time
.



something
like
one
in
1
,
000
or
so
people
just
spontaneously
have
lucid
dreams
on
a
regular
basis
,



said
benjamin
baird
,
an
assistant
research
professor
at
the
university
of
texas
at
austin
.


it



s
interesting
that
this
segment
exists
.



piecing
together
what
makes

dream
an
april
2025
journal
of
neuroscience
study
led
by
Çağatay
demirel
,
a
phd
researcher
in
dresler



s
lab
,
used
eeg
data
from
different
labs
around
the
world
to
try
to
get
a
clearer
picture
of
the
lucid
dreaming
brain
.
they
found
widespread
communication
across
different
brain
regions
.
but
when
it
comes
to
pinpointing
which
specific
areas
were
particularly
active
,
the
picture
is
still
quite
fuzzy
.

journal
of
neuroscience


after
the
initial
eureka-like
insight
of


i



m
in
a
dream
!



,
this
realization
just
lingers
in
the
back
of
the
lucid
dreamer



s
mind
,
whereas
the
ongoing
dream
scenario



[is]
in
the
mental
focus
,



dresler
explained
.
even
though
the
brain
regions
involved
in
lucidity
are
active
,
their
precise
signals
are
obscured
by
the


neural
noise



of
the
actual
dream
,
he
added
,
making
their
eeg
recordings
hard
to
capture
.

fmri
studies
do
a
better
job
of
pinpointing
activity
in
specific
brain
regions
,
but
they
are
expensive
,
and
because
lucid
dreams
are
so
rare
,
there



s
no
guarantee
a
study
participant
will
achieve
the
desired
state
while
in
the
machine
.
in
2012
,
dresler



s
team
successfully
completed
the
only
fmri
ever
performed
of
an
actively
lucid
dreaming
brain
.
they
found
certain
brain
regions
that
are
usually
relatively
quiet
during
rem
sleep



including
the
prefrontal
cortex
,
precuneus
,
and
occipito-temporal
cortices



showed
activation
in
the
person



s
brain
while
lucid
dreaming
.

six
years
later
,
baird
and
his
colleagues
used
fmri
to
study
the
brains
of
14
frequent
lucid
dreamers
while
they
were
awake
and
not
performing
any
specific
tasks
.
what
they
found
was
strikingly
similar
to
dresler



s
observations
of
the
brain
while
actively
lucid
dreaming
:
increased
communication
between
the
brain



s
metacognition
center



the
prefrontal
cortex



and
parietal
and
temporal
structures
,
which
are
associated
with
high-level
cognition
.

the
findings
indicate


a
more
tight-knit
community
of
higher-order
association
hubs
in
the
brain[s]



of
frequent
lucid
dreamers
,
said
baird
.
this
research
suggests
frequent
lucid
dreamers
have
a
relatively
high
capacity
for
things
like
metacognition
and
cognitive
control
,
or
the
ability
to
regulate
thoughts
,
attention
,
and
emotions
.

the
effect
of
dreams
on
waking
life
those
with
strong
dream
control
use
this
power
in
a
variety
of
ways
,
from
spiritual
development
to
overcoming
deep-seated
fears
.
some
lucid
dreamers
even
use
their
sleeping
hours
to
train
for
sports
or
dance
performances
or
process
problems
they
face
in
waking
life
.

but
according
to
one
study
,
the
most
common
application
of
lucid
dreaming
is
wish
fulfillment
.
lucid
dreamers
are
able
to
carry
out
desires
out
of
reach
in
waking
life
,
like
exploring
outer
space
or
interacting
with
a
loved
one
who
passed
away
.
even
though
these
scenarios
did
not
happen
in
real
life
,
the
pleasurable
experiences
of
lucid
dreams
seem
to
have
a


spill-over
effect



into
waking
life
,
leading
to
positive
daytime
mood
.

these
insights
have
sparked
a
new
interest
in
exploring
lucid
dreaming



s
potential
for
treating
mental
health
disorders
.
in
2018
,
the
american
academy
of
sleep
medicine
started
to
recommend
it
as
a
therapy
for
nightmare
disorders
,
including
those
associated
with
post-traumatic
stress
disorder
(
ptsd
)
.
neuroscientists
have
also
found
ways
to
treat
insomnia
with
lucid
dream
therapy
,
which
can
ameliorate
some
psychiatric
symptoms
.

but
turning
lucid
dreaming
into
a
treatment
may
not
be
so
simple
,
and
such
a
therapy
would
carry
a
unique
set
of
risks
.
failed
attempts
at
lucid
dreaming
can
result
in
sleep
paralysis



waking
up
but
being
temporarily
unable
to
move



or
false
awakening



the
disorienting
experience
of
thinking
you



re
awake
and
carrying
out
your
day
,
only
to
realize
you
are
still
asleep
.
such
experiences
can
blur
the
line
between
dream
life
and
reality
,
which
can
exacerbate
symptoms
for
those
prone
to
delusions
or
hallucinations
.

a
rare
gift
,
but
a
learnable
skill
still
,
the
allure
of
reaching
this
rare
state
of
consciousness
has
led
to
creative
ways
to
try
to
get
there
.
techniques
to
induce
lucid
dreaming
are
difficult
to
master
and
almost
guarantee
multiple
nights
of
interrupted
sleep
.
in
the
1990s
,
lucid
dream
induction
headsets
hit
the
commercial
market
,
but
their
high
price
tags
and
varying
effectiveness
make
them
a
controversial
choice
.

baird
and
his
team
found
the
alzheimer



s
drug
galantamine
,
which
is
used
to
treat
memory
and
other
cognitive
impairments
,
increases
lucid
dream
frequency
by
up
to
42%
compared
to
placebo
.
the
drug
increases
levels
of
acetylcholine
,
a
neurotransmitter
known
to
play
a
role
in
rem
sleep
,
which
is
when
most
lucid
dreaming
occurs
.

however
,
some
believe
the
therapeutic
potential
of
lucid
dreaming
comes
by
building
the
skills
of
metacognition
and
cognitive
control
.

researchers
are
studying
how
practices
reinforcing
these
skills
like
meditation
may
encourage
lucid
dreaming
while
offering
the
added
benefits
of
stress
reduction
,
improved
sleep
,
and
other
enhanced
markers
of
well-being
.

baird
described
meditation
as
neurocognitive
training
for
the
very
skills
required
to
lucid
dream
.


you
kind
of
develop
this


witness
mode



where
you



re
recognizing
the
state
of
your
mind
,



said
baird
.



you
also
have
to
be
able
to
notice
if
your
mind
has
drifted
from
the
target
and
then
bring
it
back
,
and
so
that
involves
a
kind
of
metacognitive
reflection
.



research
shows
long-term
meditators
are
prone
to
lucid
dreaming
.
but
in
a
2019
study
,
when
baird
and
his
team
had
non-meditators
undergo
eight
weeks
of
mindfulness
training
,
they
found
no
increase
in
lucid
dream
frequency
.

he
believes
the
meditation
protocol
was
simply
too
weak
.


it
was
kind
of
like
an
intro
to
meditation
,



he
said
.


it



s
not
like
,
say
,
going
on
a
two-month
retreat
where
you



re
meditating
for
eight
hours
per
day
.



and
one
of
baird



s
recent
studies
suggests
some
meditation
styles
may
be
more
effective
in
facilitating
lucid
dreaming
than
others
.

an
ancient
practice
to
control
your
dreams


mindfulness
is
the
tip
of
the
iceberg

gabriela
torres-platas

neuroscientist
at
northwestern
university
.
she
is
studying
the
effects
of
tibetan
dream
yoga
on
sleep
and
mental
health
.

this
contemplative
practice
incorporates
a
variety
of
meditative
exercises
into
waking
and
sleeping
life
,
and
its
specific
goal
is
to
induce
lucid
dreams
for
personal
insight

spiritual
growth

volitionally
controlled
response
or
a
reactive
,
emotionally
dysregulated
response
.

those
moments
of
reacting
without
thinking


create
non-lucidity
,



said
katie
love
,
a
dream
yoga
practitioner
and
participant
in
torres-platas



study
,
suggesting
that
a
lack
of
awareness
over
our
actions
in
waking
life
encourages
a
lack
of
awareness
in
dream
states
.

dream
yogis
perform
seemingly
impossible
tasks
in
their
lucid
dreams
,
like
transforming
into
different
dream
characters
,
walking
through
walls
,
or
multiplying
one
object
into
thousands
of
copies
.
these
techniques
allow
practitioners
to
help
cultivate
mastery
within
their
dream
worlds
,
which
may
foster
a
greater
sense
of
empowerment
and
agency
in
their
waking
lives
.



we
perceive
the
world
as
rigid
and
solid
,



said
torres-platas
,
but


when
you
can
go
into
a
dream
and
change
your
environment
by
,
for
example
,
walking
through
a
wall
,
you
train
your
mind
for
flexibility



in
the
real
world
.

she
hypothesizes
that
practicing
specific
meditation
techniques
while
awake
,
combined
with
lucid
dreaming
while
asleep
,
may
help
ease
symptoms
of
anxiety
and
depression
by
increasing
one
'
s
insight
and
control
over
their
thoughts
and
emotions
.



you
have
learned
to
react
in
a
certain
way
,
so
it
bypasses
conscious
awareness
,



said
torres-platas
,
highlighting
how
automatic
patterns
can
override
metacognition
and
self-regulation
.


it



s
like
when
someone
insults
you
,
and
you
snap
back



there



s
no
space
for
reflection
or
choice
in
the
moment
.



she
said
the
deep
self-reflection
required
to
gain
lucidity
while
dreaming
may
teach
us
how
to
better
navigate
difficult
circumstances
.

instead
of
persisting
in
a
mindset
of
agony
or
hopelessness
,
we
can
reflect
on
how
we
process
and
analyze
the
world
,
which
gives
us
the
opportunity
to
reframe
our
thoughts
.
where
pessimistic
beliefs
leave
us
stuck
in
a
swirling
pit
of
despair
,
lucid
dreaming
might
open
a
path
to
something
else
.

research

we
often
hear
stories
of
people
who



ve
learned
from
their
dreams
or
been
inspired
by
them
.
think
of
paul
mccartney



s
story
of
how
his
hit
song


yesterday



came
to
him
in
a
dream
or
of
mendeleev



s
dream-inspired
construction
of
the
periodic
table
of
elements
.

but
,
while
many
of
us
may
feel
that
our
dreams
have
special
meaning
or
a
useful
purpose
,
science
has
been
more
skeptical
of
that
claim
.

instead
of
being
harbingers
of
creativity
or
some
kind
of
message
from
our
unconscious
,
some
scientists
have
considered
dreaming
to
be
an
unintended
consequence
of
sleep


a
byproduct
of
evolution
without
benefit
.

sleep
itself
is
a
different
story
.
scientists
have
known
for
a
while
now
that
shorter
sleep
is
tied
to
dangerous
diseases
,
like
heart
disease
and
stroke
.
there
is
mounting
evidence
that
sleep
deprivation
leads
to
a
higher
risk
of
obesity
and
alzheimer



s
disease
.
large
population
studies
reflect
a
saddening
truth


the
shorter
your
sleep
,
the
shorter
your
life
.
not
only
that
,
sleep
helps
us
to
hold
onto
our
memories
and
to
learn
facts
and
skills
faster
,
making
it
important
for
everyone
including
infants
,
students
,
athletes
,
pilots
,
and
doctors
.

much
of
this
i
outline
in
my
new
book
,
why
we
sleep
:
unlocking
the
power
of
sleep
and
dreams
,
which
summarizes
the
many
findings
we
have
about
sleep
and
its
function
in
our
lives
.

but
what
about
dreaming
?
does
it
also
have
a
purpose
?

recent
work
in
my
neuroscience
lab
and
the
work
of
other
scientists
has
shown
that
dreams
may
have
a
very
particular
function
important
to
our
well-being
.
here
are
the
two
main
ways
dreams
help
us
.

dreaming
is
like
overnight
therapy
it



s
said
that
time
heals
all
wounds
,
but
my
research
suggests
that
time
spent
in
dream
sleep
is
what
heals
.
rem-sleep
dreaming
appears
to
take
the
painful
sting
out
of
difficult
,
even
traumatic
,
emotional
episodes
experienced
during
the
day
,
offering
emotional
resolution
when
you
awake
the
next
morning
.

rem
sleep
is
the
only
time
when
our
brain
is
completely
devoid
of
the
anxiety-triggering
molecule
noradrenaline
.
at
the
same
time
,
key
emotional
and
memory-related
structures
of
the
brain
are
reactivated
during
rem
sleep
as
we
dream
.
this
means
that
emotional
memory
reactivation
is
occurring
in
a
brain
free
of
a
key
stress
chemical
,
which
allows
us
to
re-process
upsetting
memories
in
a
safer
,
calmer
environment
.

how
do
we
know
this
is
so
?
in
one
study
in
my
sleep
center
,
healthy
young
adult
participants
were
divided
into
two
groups
to
watch
a
set
of
emotion-inducing
images
while
inside
an
mri
scanner
.
twelve
hours
later
,
they
were
shown
the
same
emotional
images


but
for
half
the
participants
,
the
twelve
hours
were
in
the
same
day
,
while
for
the
other
half
the
twelve
hours
were
separated
by
an
evening
of
sleep
.

reported
a
significant
decrease
in
how
emotional
they
felt
in
response
to
seeing
those
images
again
,
and
their
mri
scans
showed
a
significant
reduction
in
reactivity
in
the
amygdala
,
the
emotional
center
of
the
brain
that
creates
painful
feelings
.
moreover
,
there
was
a
reengagement
of
the
rational
prefrontal
cortex
of
the
brain
after
sleep
that
helped
maintain
a
dampening
influence
on
emotional
reactivity
.
in
contrast
,
those
who
remained
awake
across
the
day
showed
no
such
dissolving
of
emotional
reactivity
over
time
.

that
in
itself
doesn



t
say
anything
about
the
role
of
dreaming
.
but
we
had
recorded
each
participant



s
sleep
during
the
intervening
night
between
the
two
test
sessions
,
and
we
found
that
specific
brain
activity
that
reflected
a
drop
in
stress-related
brain
chemistry
during
the
dream
state
determined
the
success
of
overnight
therapy
from
one
individual
to
the
next
.

dreaming
has
the
potential
to
help
people
de-escalate
emotional
reactivity
,
probably
because
the
emotional
content
of
dreams
is
paired
with
a
decrease
in
brain
noradrenaline
.
support
for
this
idea
came
from
a
study
done
by
murray
raskind
on
vets
with
ptsd
,
who
often
suffer
debilitating
nightmares
.
when
given
the
drug
prazosin


a
medication
that
lowers
blood
pressure
and
also
acts
as
a
blocker
of
the
brain
stress
chemical
noradrenaline


the
vets
in
his
study
had
fewer
nightmares
and
fewer
ptsd
symptoms
than
those
given
a
placebo
.
newer
studies
suggest
this
effect
can
be
shown
in
children
and
adolescents
with
nightmares
,
as
well
,
though
the
research
on
this
is
still
in
its
infancy
.

the
evidence
points
toward
an
important
function
of
dreams
:
to
help
us
take
the
sting
out
of
our
painful
emotional
experiences
during
the
hours
we
are
asleep
,
so
that
we
can
learn
from
them
and
carry
on
with
our
lives
.

dreaming
enhances
creativity
and
problem-solving
it



s
been
shown
that
deep
non-rem
sleep
strengthens
individual
memories
.
but
rem
sleep
is
when
those
memories
can
be
fused
and
blended
together
in
abstract
and
highly
novel
ways
.
during
the
dreaming
state
,
your
brain
will
cogitate
vast
swaths
of
acquired
knowledge
and
then
extract
overarching
rules
and
commonalties
,
creating
a
mindset
that
can
help
us
divine
solutions
to
previously
impenetrable
problems
.

how
do
we
know
dreaming
and
not
just
sleep
is
important
to
this
process
?

in
one
study
,
we
tested
this
by
waking
up
participants
during
the
night


during
both
non-rem
sleep
and
dreaming
sleep


and
gave
them
very
short
tests
:
solving
anagram
puzzles
,
where
you
try
to
unscramble
letters
to
form
a
word
(
e
.
g
.
,
oseog
=
goose
)
.
first
,
participants
were
tested
beforehand
,
just
to
familiarize
them
with
the
test
.
then
,
we
monitored
their
sleep
and
woke
them
up
at
different
points
of
the
night
to
perform
the
test
.
when
woken
during
non-rem
sleep
,
they
were
not
particularly
creative


they
could
solve
very
few
puzzles
.
but
,
when
we
woke
up
participants
during
rem
sleep
,
they
were
able
to
solve
15-35
percent
more
puzzles
than
when
they
were
awake
.
not
only
that
,
participants
woken
while
dreaming
reported
that
the
solution
just


popped



into
their
heads
,
as
if
it
were
effortless
.

in
another
study
,
i
and
my
colleagues
taught
participants
a
series
of
relational
facts


such
as
,
a>b
,
b>c
,
c>d
,
and
so
on


and
tested
their
understanding
by
asking
them
questions
(
e
.
g
.
,
is
b>d
or
not
?
)
.

afterwards
,
we
compared
their
performance
on
this
test
before
and
after
a
full
night



s
sleep
,
and
also
after
they



d
had
a
60-
to
90-minute
nap
that
included
rem
sleep
.
those
who



d
slept
or
had
a
long
nap
performed
much
better
on
this
test
than
when
they
were
awake
,
as
if
they



d
put
together
disparate
pieces
of
a
jigsaw
puzzle
in
their
sleep
.

some
may
consider
this
trivial
,
but
it
is
one
of
the
key
operations
differentiating
your
brain
from
your
computer
.
it
also
underlies
the
difference
between
knowledge
(
retention
of
individual
facts
)
and
wisdom
(
knowing
what
they
all
mean
when
you
fit
them
together
)
.
the
latter
seems
to
be
the
work
of
rem-sleep
dreaming
.



it



s
said
that
time
heals
all
wounds
,
but
my
research
suggests
that
time
spent
in
dream
sleep
is
what
heals

dreaming
improves
creative
problem
solving
,
too
,
according
to
another
study
.
participants
learned
to
navigate
a
virtual
maze
using
trial
and
error
and
aided
by
the
placement
of
unique
objects


like
christmas
trees


at
certain
junctions
in
the
maze
.
after
this
learning
session
,
the
group
was
split
in
two
,
with
half
napping
and
half
watching
a
video
for
90
minutes
.
nappers
were
occasionally
awoken
to
ask
about
the
content
of
their
dreams
;
those
watching
a
video
were
also
asked
about
thoughts
going
through
their
minds
.

afterwards
,
the
participants
again
tried
to
solve
the
maze
,
and
those
who
napped
were
significantly
better
at
it
than
those
who
didn



t
,
as
expected
.
but
the
nappers
who
reported
dreaming
about
the
maze
were
10
times
better
at
the
task
than
those
who
napped
and
didn



t
dream
about
the
maze
.
there



s
a
reason
you



ve
never
been
told
to
stay
awake
on
a
problem
.

looking
at
the
content
of
these
dreams
,
it
was
clear
that
the
participants
didn



t
dream
a
precise
replay
of
the
learning
experience
while
awake
.
instead
,
they
were
cherry-picking
salient
fragments
of
the
learning
experience
and
attempting
to
place
them
within
the
catalog
of
preexisting
knowledge
.
this
is
how
dreaming
helps
us
be
more
creative
.

while
the
benefits
of
dreaming
are
real
,
too
many
of
us
have
problems
getting
a
full
eight
hours
of
sleep
and
lose
out
on
these
advantages
.

alternatively
,
we
may
think
we



re
the
exception
to
the
rule


that
we



re
one
of
those
people
who
doesn



t
happen
to
need
a
lot
of
sleep
.
but
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
truth
.
research
clearly
shows
that
people
who
overestimate
their
ability
to
get
by
on
less
sleep
are
sadly
wrong
.

five
ways
to
enhance
your
sleep
book
cover
of
this
essay
was
adapted
from
matthew
walker
'
s
new
book
,
why
we
sleep
:
unlocking
the
power
of
sleep
and
dreams
(
scribner
,
2017
,
368
pages
)
.

so
how
can
we
be
sure
to
get
enough
sleep
and
experience
a
dream
state
?

while
we
may
be
tempted
to
use
sleeping
pills
to
get
to
sleep
,
this
has
been
shown
to
be
detrimental
to
dreaming
.
instead
of
taking
pills
,
here
are
some
simple
ways
to
enhance
your
sleep
:
1
.
make
sure
your
room
is
dark
and
that
you
are
not
looking
at
bright
light
sources


i
.
e
.
,
computer
screens
and
cell
phones


in
the
last
hour
or
two
before
going
to
bed
.
you
may
even
want
to
start
dimming
lights
in
your
house
in
the
earlier
parts
of
the
evening
,
which
helps
to
stimulate
sleepiness
.

2
.
go
to
bed
and
wake
up
at
approximately
the
same
time
every
day
.
this
helps
signal
to
your
body
a
regular
time
for
sleeping
.
it



s
no
use
trying
to
sleep
in
a
lot
on
weekends
.
there
is
no
way
to
make
up
for
regular
sleep
loss
during
the
week
.

3
.
keep
the
temperature
in
your
house
cool
at
night


maybe
even
cooler
than
you
think
it
should
be
,
like
around
65
degrees
.
your
body
temperature
needs
to
drop
at
night
for
sleep
,
and
a
lower
room
temperature
helps
signal
your
brain
that
it



s
time
to
sleep
.

4
.
if
you
have
trouble
falling
asleep
,
or
wake
in
the
night
feeling
restless
,
don



t
stay
in
bed
awake
.
that
trains
the
brain
that
your
bed
is
not
a
place
for
sleeping
.
instead
,
get
up
and
read
a
book
under
dim
light
in
a
different
room
.
don



t
look
at
your
computer
or
cell
phone
.

when
sleepiness
returns
,
then
go
back
to
bed
.
or
if
you
don



t
want
to
get
out
of
bed
,
try
meditating
.
studies
suggest
it
helps
individuals
fall
asleep
faster
,
and
also
improves
sleep
quality
.

5
.
don



t
have
caffeine
late
in
the
day
or
an
alcohol-infused
nightcap
.

both
of
these
interfere
with
sleep


either
keeping
you
awake
or
stimulating
frequent
wake-ups
during
the
night
.

sleep
is
the
single
most
effective
thing
we
can
do
to
rest
our
brain
and
physical
health
each
day
.
atop
of
sleep
,
dreaming
provides
essential
emotional
first
aid
and
a
unique
form
of
informational
alchemy
.
if
we
wish
to
be
as
healthy
,
happy
,
and
creative
as
possible
,
these
are
facts
well
worth
waking
up
to
.

you
are
terrified
and
running
along
a
dark
,
narrow
corridor
.
something
very
evil
and
scary
is
chasing
you
,
but
you



re
not
sure
why
.
your
fear
is
compounded
by
the
fact
that
your
feet
won



t
do
what
you
want


it
feels
like
they
are
moving
through
molasses
.
the
pursuer
is
gaining
,
but
when
it
finally
catches
you
,
the
whole
scene
vanishes
.
.
.
and
you
wake
up
.

almost
by
definition
,
a
dream
is
something
you
are
aware
of
at
some
level
.
it
may
be
fragmentary
,
disconnected
,
and
illogical
,
but
if
you
aren



t
aware
of
it
during
sleep
then
it
isn



t
a
dream
.
many
people
will
protest
,


i
never
remember
my
dreams
!
,



but
that
is
a
different
matter
entirely
.
failing
to
remember
a
dream
later
on
when
you



re
awake
doesn



t
mean
you
weren



t
aware
of
it
when
it
occurred
.
it
just
means
the
experience
was
never
really
carved
into
your

,
has
decayed

we
all
intuitively
know
what
a
dream
is
,
but
you



ll
be
surprised
to
learn
there



s
no
universally
accepted
definition
of
dreaming
.
one
fairly
safe
catch-all
is


all
perceptions
,
thoughts
,
or
emotions
experienced
during
sleep
.



because
this
is
very
broad
,
there
are
also
several
different
ways
of
rating
,
ranking
,
and
scoring
dreams
.
for
example
,
one
uses
an
eight-point
rating
system
from
0
(
no
dream
)
to
7
(


an
extremely
long
sequence
of
5
or
more
stages



)
.

physical
bases
of
dreams
but
let
me
backtrack
.
one
aim
of
neuroscience
is
to
map
the
brain
loci
of
thoughts
and
mental
experiences
.
everything
we
see
,
imagine
,
or
think
about
is
linked
to
neural
responses
somewhere
in
the
brain
.

dreams
also
have
a
home
.
neural
activity
in
the
primary
sensory
areas
of
the
neocortex
produces
the
impression
of
sensory
perception
.
this
means
that
neurons
firing
in
the
primary
visual
cortex
create
the
illusion
of
seeing
things
,
neurons
firing
in
the
primary
auditory
area
create
the
illusion
of
hearing
things
,
and
so
forth
.
if
that
firing
occurs
at
random
,
these
perceptions
can
feel
like
crazy
,
randomly
fragmented
hallucinations
.
it
is
easy
to
imagine
that
the
random
imagery
and
sensations
created
in
this
way
could
be
woven
together
to
create
a
complex
,
multisensory
hallucination
which
we
might
call
a
dream
.

.
.
.

do
dreams
serve
a
purpose
?

in
contrast
to
an
activation-synthesis
model
,
which
views
dreams
as
epiphenomena


a
simple
by-product
of
neural
processes
in
sleep


other
scientists
have
suggested
that
dreams
serve
an
important
function
.
as
usual
in
psychology
,
there
are
lots
of
different
ideas
about
what
this
function
could
be
.
sigmund
freud



s
suggestion
that
dreams
express
forbidden
desires
is
of
course
the
most
famous
of
these
,
but
there
are
lots
of
other
theories
about
what
dreams
might
do
,
many
with
more
empirical
support
than
the
freudian
view
.
for
example
,
the
threat
simulation
hypothesis
suggests
that
dreams
may
provide
a
sort
of
virtual
reality
simulation
in
which
we
can
rehearse
threatening
situations
,
even
if
we
don



t
remember
the
dreams
.
presumably
,
this
rehearsal
would
lead
to
better
real-life
responses
,
so
the
rehearsal
is
adaptive
.
evidence
supporting
this
comes
from
the
large
proportion
of
dreams
which
include
a
threatening
situation
(
more
than
70
percent
in
some
studies
)
and
the
fact
that
this
percentage
is
much
higher
than
the
incidence
of
threats
in
the
dreamer



s
actual
daytime
life
.
furthermore
,
studies
of
children
in
two
different
areas
of
palestine
show
that
those
who
live
in
a
more
threatening
environment
also
have
a
much
higher
incidence
of
threat
in
their
dreams
.
reactions
to
these
threats
are
almost
always
relevant
and
sensible
,
so
the
rehearsal
(
if
that



s
what
it
is
)
clearly
involves
plausible
solutions
,
again
suggesting
that
they
provide
a
kind
of
valid
simulation
of
potential
real-life
scenarios
.

another
suggestion
is
that
dreams
influence
the
way
you
feel
the
next
day
,
either
in
terms
of
mood
or
more
basic
bodily
states
.
forcing
people
to
remember
the
nastier
dreams
from
their
rem
sleep
definitely
puts
them
in
a
foul
mood
,
and
nightmares
(
defined
as
very
negative
dreams
which
can
wake
you
up
)
may
even
lead
to
ongoing
mood
problems
.

on
the
other
hand
,
there
is
also
evidence
that
dreams
could
help
to
regulate
long-term
mood
.
for
instance
,
a
study
of
dreams
in
divorced
women
showed
that
those
who
dreamed
about
their
ex-husbands
more
often
were
better
adapted
to
the
divorce
.
amazingly
enough
,
dreams
also
seem
able
to
influence
physiological
state
:
one
study
showed
that
people
who
were
deprived
of
water
before
they
slept
,
but
then
drank
in
their
dreams
,
felt
less
thirsty
when
they
woke
up
.

the
content
of
dreams
can
be
influenced
in
lots
of
different
ways
.
for
instance
,
recent
work
has
shown
that
sleepers
tend
to
initiate
pleasant
dreams
if
nice
smells
are
wafted
at
them
in
rem
sleep
,
and
they
have
negative
or
unhappy
dreams
if
stinky
,
unpleasant
smells
are
sent
their
way
.
some
people
can
achieve
lucid
dreaming
,
in
which
they
control
the
sequence
of
events
in
their
dream
,
and
evidence
suggests
that
these
techniques
can
be
learned
by
intensive
practice
and
training
.
all
of
this
is
highly
tantalizing
,
of
course
,
because
(
though
it
tells
us
nothing
at
all
about
the
original
evolved
purpose
of
dreams
)
it
suggests
we
might
not
only
be
able
to
set
ourselves
up
for
pleasant
experiences
while
we
sleep
,
but
we
might
also
eventually
be
able
to
use
these
techniques
to
treat
mood
disorders
,
phobias
,
and
other
psychological
problems
.
we
already
know
that
hypnotic
suggestion
can
cause
people
to
incorporate
snakes
,
spiders
,
or
other
things
about
which
they
have
phobias
into
their
dreams
,
and


when
combined
with
more
benign
forms
of
these
menacing
objects


such
incorporation
helps
to
remove
the
phobia
.
hypnotic
suggestion
can
also
make
dreams
more
pleasant
,
and
mental
imagery
practiced
during
the
day
can
be
used
to
modify
(
and
often
nullify
)
persistent
nightmares
.

there
is
little
evidence
that
people
actually
learn
during
their
dreams
.
the
fact
that
they
can
learn
during
sleep
is
a
different
matter
,
but
dreams
themselves
don



t
appear
to
be
a
good
forum
for
imprinting
new
information
into
the
hippocampus
(
after
all
,
we
don



t
even
remember
our
dreams
most
of
the
time
)
.
studies
of
language
learning
illustrate
this
well
.
although
learning
efficiency
is
predicted
by
an
increase
in
the
percentage
of
the
night
that
is
spent
in
rem
,
the
dreams
which
are
experienced
during
this
extra
rem
don



t
have
much
to
do
with
language
.
if
they
relate
to
it
at
all
they
are
most
often
about
the
frustration
of
not
being
able
to
understand
something
and
not
about
the
mechanics
of
how
to
construct
or
decode
a
sentence
.

memories
in
dreams
what



s
the
most
recent
dream
you
can
remember
?
was
anyone
you
know
in
it
?
did
it
happen
in
a
place
you
know
well
?
were
you
doing
something
familiar
?
most
dreams
incorporate
fragments
of
experiences
from
our
waking
lives
.
it



s
common
to
dream
about
disconnected
snippets
like
a
particular
person
,
place
,
or
activity
.
but
do
dreams
ever
replay
complete
memories


for
instance
,
the
last
time
you
saw
your
mother
,
including
the
place
,
activities
,
and
people
?
memories
like
this
are
called
episodic
because
they
represent
whole
episodes
instead
of
just
fragments
;
studies
the
secret
world
of
sleep
of
dreaming
show
that
these
types
of
memories
are
sometimes
replayed
in
sleep
,
but
it
is
quite
rare
(
around
2
percent
of
dreams
contain
such
memories
,
according
to
one
study
)
.
most
of
our
dreams
just
recombine
fragments
of
waking
life
.
these
fragments
are
relatively
familiar
and
reflect
the
interests
and
concerns
of
the
dreamer
.
this
means
cyclists
dream
about
cycling
,
teachers
dream
about
teaching
,
and
bankers
dream
about
money
.

some
researchers
have
capitalized
upon
dream
reports
to
gain
insight
into
the
process
by
which
memories
are
immediately
incorporated
(
i
.
e
.
,
in
the
first
night
after
they
were
initially
experienced
)
.
freud
famously
referred
to
this
as


day-residues
.



one
study
showed
day
residues
appear
in
65
to
70
percent
of
single
dream
reports
.
on
the
other
hand
,
a
more
recently
described
phenomenon
called
the
dream-lag
effect
refers
to
the
extraordinary
observation
that
,
after
its
initial
appearance
as
a
day
residue
,
the
likelihood
that
a
specific
memory
will
be
incorporated
into
dreams
decreases
steadily
across
the
next
few
nights
after
the
memory
was
formed
,
then
increases
again
across
the
following
few
nights
(
fig
.
20
)
.

thus
,
it
is
very
common
for
memories
to
be
incorporated
into
dreams
on
the
first
night
after
they
were
initially
experienced
(
if
i
have
a
car
crash
today
,
i



m
likely
to
dream
about
it
tonight
)
.
the
likelihood
of
such
incorporation
decreases
gradually
across
the
next
few
nights
,
with
few
memories
incorporated
into
dreams
three
to
five
days
after
they
occurred
.
extraordinarily
,
however
,
the
probability
that
a
memory
will
be
incorporated
into
a
dream
increases
again
on
nights
six
and
seven
after
it
was
initially
experienced
.
what
is
going
on
here
?
why
are
memories
less
likely
to
be
incorporated
into
dreams
three
to
five
days
after
they
originally
occurred
than
six
to
seven
days
afterward
?
one
possibility
relates
to
the
need
for
consolidation
.
memories
may
be
inaccessible
at
this
stage
because
they
are
being
processed
in
some
way
which
takes
them
temporarily


offline
.



notably
,
this
effect
is
only
true
for
people
who
report
vivid
dreams
,
and
it
also
appears
to
only
be
true
of
rem
dreams
.
as
with
most
research
,
the
dream-lag
effect
raises
more
questions
than
it
answers
.

[break]
why
do
we
have
different
kinds
of
dreams
at
different
stages
of
the
night
?

dreams
aren



t
all
the
same
.
everyone
is
aware
of
the
difference
between
good
and
bad
dreams
,
but
we
don



t
tend
to
notice
that
some
dreams
are
more
logical
and
structured
while
others
are
more
bizarre
.
some
dreams
are
so
highly
realistic
that
it
is
difficult
to
convince
ourselves
they
aren



t
real
,
while
others
are
fuzzy
and
indistinct
.
some
dreams
are
fragmented
,
jumping
rapidly
from
one
topic
to
another
,
while
others
move
forward
in
a
more
coherent
story
.
recent
analyses
have
suggested
that
these
differences
are
far
from
random
;
instead
they
may
be
driven
by
the
physiology
of
various
brain
states
and
the
extent
to
which
structures
like
the
hippocampus
and
neocortex
are
in
communication
during
different
sleep
stages
.

dreams
occur
in
all
stages
of
sleep
,
but
they
seem
to
become
increasingly
fragmented
as
the
night
progresses
.
in
general
,
they
appear
to
be
constructed
out
of
a
mishmash
of
prior
experience
.
as
mentioned
above
,
dreams
contain
disconnected
memory
fragments
:
places
we



ve
been
,
faces
we



ve
seen
,
situations
that
are
partly
familiar
.

these
fragments
can
either
be
pasted
together
in
a
semi-random
mess
or
organized
in
a
structured
and
realistic
way
.
the
dreams
that
occur
in
non-rem
sleep
tend
to
be
shorter
but
more
cohesive
than
rem
dreams
,
and
often
they
relate
to
things
that
just
happened
the
day
before
.
rem
dreams
that
occur
early
in
the
night
often
also
reflect
recent
waking
experiences
,
but
they
are
more
fragmented
than
their
non-rem
counterparts
.
conversely
,
rem
dreams
that
occur
late
in
the
night
are
typically
much
more
bizarre
and
disjointed
.

simply
thinking
about
where
these
memory
fragments
are
coming
from
and
how
they
are
connected
together
may
provide
an
explanation
for
the
difference
between
early
and
late-night
dreams
.
the
various
elements
of
an
episode
are
thought
to
be
stored
in
the
neocortex
,
but
they
are
not
necessarily
linked
together
to
form
a
complete
representation
.
for
example
,
if
your
memory
of
having
dinner
last
night
involves
memories
about
a
specific
place
,
specific
sounds
,
specific
actions
,
and
maybe
even
memories
about
other
people
who
were
there
,
each
of
these
bits
of
information
is
represented
by
a
different
area
of
the
neocortex
.
even
though
they
combine
together
to
make
up
a
complete
memory
,
these
various
neocortical
areas
may
not
be
directly
interlinked
.
instead
,
the
hippocampus
keeps
track
of
such
connections
and
forms
the
appropriate
linkages
,
at
least
while
the
memory
is
relatively
fresh
.
however
,
communication
between
the
neocortex
and
hippocampus
is
disrupted
during
sleep
,
so
this
process
is
also
disrupted
.
during
rem
sleep
,
both
the
hippocampus
and
those
parts
of
the
neocortex
which
are
involved
in
a
current
dream
are
strongly
active


but
they
don



t
appear
to
be
in
communication
.
instead
,
responses
in
the
neocortex
occur
independently
,
without
hippocampal
input
,
so
they
must
relate
to
memory
fragments
rather
than
linked
multisensory
representations
.
essentially
,
when
memories
which
have
been
stored
in
the
neocortex
are
accessed
or
activated
during
rem
,
they
remain
fragmentary
instead
of
drawing
in
other
aspects
of
the
same
memory
to
form
a
complete
episodic
replay
.

these
fragments
aren



t
linked
together
in
the
way
they
might
be
if
you
thought
of
the
same
place
while
you
were
awake
(
or
indeed
in
non-rem
sleep
)
.
for
instance
,
cortical
representations
of
both
someone
who
was
present
for
your
dinner
last
night
and
of
the
place
where
it
was
held
may
be
triggered
,
but
these
will
not
necessarily
be
linked
together
,
and
they
may
not
be
linked
to
the
idea
of
dinner
or
eating
at
all
.

instead
,
seemingly
unrelated
characters
and
events
may
be
activated
in
conjunction
with
the
memory
of
this
place
.
one
possible
driver
for
this
is
the
stress
hormone
cortisol
,
which
increases
steadily
across
the
night
.
high
cortisol
concentrations
can
block
communication
between
the
hippocampus
and
neocortex
,
and
since
concentrations
are
much
higher
early
in
the
morning
,
this
could
provide
a
physiological
reason
for
the
disjointed
properties
of
late-night
(
early
morning
)
dreams
.

irrespective
of
how
it
happens
,
it
is
clear
that
dreams
not
only
replay
memory
fragments
but
also
create
brand-new
,
highly
creative
mixtures
of
memories
and
knowledge
.
this
process
has
led
to
the
creation
of
many
works
of
literature
,
art
,
and
science
,
such
as
mary
shelley



s
frankenstein
,
the
molecular
formula
of
benzene
,
and
the
invention
of
the
light
bulb
.
an
especially
good
demonstration
of
this
somnolent
creativity
comes
from
a
study
of
35
professional
musicians
who
not
only
heard
more
music
in
their
dreams
than
your
normal
man-on-the-street
but
also
reported
that
much
of
this
(
28
percent
)
was
music
they
had
never
heard
in
waking
life
.
they
had
created
new
music
in
their
dreams
!

although
we
don



t
quite
understand
how
dreams
achieve
this
type
of
innovative
recombination
of
material
,
it
seems
clear
that
the
sleeping
brain
is
somehow
freed
of
constraints
and
can
thus
create
whole
sequences
of
free
associations
.
this
is
not
only
useful
for
creativity
,
it
is
also
thought
to
facilitate
insight
and
problem
solving
.
it
may
even
be
critical
for
the
integration
of
newly
acquired
memories
with
more
remote
ones
(
see
chapter
8
)
.
in
fact
,
this
facilitated
lateral
thinking
could
,
in
itself
,
be
the
true
purpose
of
dreams
.
it
is
certainly
valuable
enough
to
have
evolved
through
natural
selection
.

,
organisers
said
a
woman
who
was
bullied
at
school
for
being
gay
has
said
she
has
"achieved
her
dream"
after
being
crowned
miss
england
.

grace
richardson
said
she
suffered
constant
teasing
due
to
her
sexuality
while
at
school
in
leicestershire
.

the
musical
theatre
student
,
from
leicester
,
said
she
was
proud
to
have
ignored
the
negativity
,
going
on
to
win
the
prize
after
entering
the
competition
for
only
the
second
time
.

she
is
now
the
first
openly
gay
miss
england
,
after
being

wolverhampton
on
friday
.

miss
richardson
,
who

2026
,
said
she
was
bullied
"horrendously"
while
at
school
.

she
said
:
"so
i
was
15
when
i
came
out
.
it
was
just
after
covid
and
my
peers
at
school
just
really
weren
'
t
very
nice
to
me
,
which
definitely
took
a
bit
of
a
toll
on
my
mental
health
.

"i
used
to
get
picked
on
for
countless
things
,
being
too
skinny
,
being
really
short
and
then
becoming
really
tall
.

"it
'
s
almost
like
everything
i
did
was
wrong
.

"so
it
'
s
nice
being
able
to
stand
up
now
and
say
,
'
look
at
what
i
'
ve
done
'
.

"i
'
ve
ignored
everything
negative
that
they
said
to
me
and
actually
i
'
ve
gone
on
to
achieve
my
dreams
.

,
having
won
the

she
was

to
perform
a
ballet
dance
,
but
broke
her
foot
the
week
after
entering
the
event
,
and
so
used
another
of

her

we
spend
roughly
one-third
of
our
lives
sleeping


and
during
that
time
,
we
dream
.
many
theories
exist
to
explain
why
we
dream
,
but
researchers
still
don
'
t
know
for
sure
.
some
believe
dreams
have
symbolic
meaning
,
whereas
others
believe
that
they
relate
to
waking
life
.

what
scientists
do
know
is
that
just
about
everyone
dreams
every
time
they
sleep
,
and
those
dreams
can
be
fascinating
,
exciting
,
terrifying
,
or
just
plain
weird
.

most
of
those
dreams
are
forgotten
within
minutes
of
waking
.
most
people
dream
in
color
,
but
some
dream
in
black
and
white
.
our
dream
content
can
also
differ
from
one
person
to
the
next
,
and
some
people
can
control
what
they
dream
about
as
if
they
were
writing
the
script
.

if
you
'
ve
ever
wondered
what
makes
dreams
so
fascinating
and
sometimes
strange
,
exploring
some
dream
facts
can
help
you
gain
greater
insight
into
this
state
of
consciousness
.

we
dream
every
night
the
brain
is
active
all
night
long
.
brain
activity
in
the
forebrain
and
midbrain
is
particularly
intense
during
rapid
eye
movement
(
rem
)
sleep
,
which
is
when
we
dream
.

adults
and
babies
alike
dream
for
around
two
hours
per
night
,
even
if
they
don
'
t
remember
it
.
in
fact
,
researchers
have
found
that
people
usually
have
several
dreams
each
night
,
each
typically
lasting
for
five
to
20
minutes
.

during
a
typical
lifetime
,
people
spend
an
average
of
six
years
dreaming
.

when
dreams
merge
with
your
waking
life


what
to
know
about
deja
reve
we
forget
most
of
our
dreams
1
:
48
7
theories
on
why
we
dream
simplified
we
forget
up
to
95%
of
all
dreams
shortly
after
waking
.

according
to
one
theory
about
why
dreams
are
so
difficult
to
remember
,
changes
in
the
brain
during
sleep
don
'
t
support
the
information
processing
and
storage
needed
to
form
memories
.

brain
scans
of
sleepers
have
shown
that
the
frontal
lobes


the
area
that
plays
a
key
role
in
memory
formation


are
inactive
during
rem
sleep
,
the
stage
in
which
dreaming
occurs
.

we
might
also
forget
our
dreams
because
of
changes
in
the
levels
of
certain
neurotransmitters
,
specifically
acetylcholine
and
norepinephrine
,
during
rem
sleep
.

yet
another
study
found
a
link
between
dream
recall
and
the
brain
matter
density
of
the
medial
prefrontal
cortex
(
mpfc
)
.
participants
with
higher
white
matter
density
were
more
likely
to
recall
their
dreams
.

not
all
dreams
are
in
color
according
to
a
2017
study
,
around
50%
of
people
report
dreaming
in
color
almost
all
of
the
time
.
however
,
they
also
suggested
they
dream
in
black
and
white
around
10%
of
the
time
.
an
older
2008
study
suggested
that
roughly
12%
of
people
dream
only
in
black-and-white
.

people
younger
than
25
rarely
report
dreaming
in
black
and
white
.

however
,
people
older
than
55
report
black-and-white
dreams
about
25%
of
the
time
.
researchers
believe
this
difference
results
from
childhood
exposure
to
black-and-white
television
.
an
older
study
,
which
found
that
people
in
the
1940s
rarely
reported
dreaming
in
color
,
supports
this
idea
.

men
and
women
dream
differently
researchers
have
also
found
differences
between
men
and
women
in
dream
content
.
in
several
studies
,
men
reported
dreaming
about
weapons
significantly
more
often
than
women
did
,
whereas
women
dreamed
about
clothing
more
often
than
men
.

another
study
showed
that
men
'
s
dreams
tend
to
have
more
aggressive
content
and
physical
activity
,
whereas
women
'
s
dreams
contain
more
rejection
and
exclusion
,
as
well
as
more
conversation
than
physical
activity
.

women
tend
to
have
slightly
longer
dreams
with
more
characters
.
men
dream
about
other
men
twice
as
often
as
they
do
about
women
;
women
tend
to
dream
about
both
sexes
equally
.
women
also
report
having
more
nightmares
than
men
.

animals
probably
dream
many
think
that
,
when
a
sleeping
dog
wags
its
tail
or
a
sleeping
cat
swats
its
paws
,
it
'
s
dreaming
.
although
no
one
can
say
for
sure
,
researchers
believe
that
most
animals
go
through
rem
and
non-rem
sleep
stages
,
so
they
probably
do
dream
.

animals
might
not
experience
dreams
in
the
same
way
as
humans
,
however
.

in
other
words
,
they
might
not
remember
images
or
attach
a
storyline
to
them
.

you
can
control
your
dreams
a
lucid
dream
is
one
in
which
you
'
re
aware
that
you
'
re
dreaming
even
though
you
'
re
still
asleep
.

lucid
dreaming
is
thought
to
be
a
combination
of
consciousness
and
rem
sleep
,
during
which
you
can
direct
or
control
the
dream
content
.

people
can
learn
how
to
have
lucid
dreams
using
various
techniques
,
including
mnemonic
induction
of
lucid
dreams
(
mild
)
and
senses-initiated
lucid
dreams
(
ssild
)
.
these
involve
waking
up
after
five
hours
and
repeating
a
phrase
like
"i
will
remember
my
dream"
or
focusing
on
the
stimuli
(
sights
,
sounds
,
sensations
)
in
your
sleep
environment
,
respectively
.

approximately
half
of
all
people
can
remember
at
least
one
instance
of
lucid
dreaming
,
and
some
are
able
to
have
lucid
dreams
frequently
.

negative
dreams
are
more
common
researcher

s

hall
,
collected
more
than
50
,
000
dream
accounts
from
college
students
over
more
than
40
years
.
made
available
to
the
public
in
the
1990s
by
hall
'
s
student
,
william
domhoff
,
the
dream
accounts
reported
many
emotions
during
dreams
.

several
factors
affect
the
emotional
content
of
dreams
,
including
anxiety
,
stress
,
and
certain
medications
.
research
has
found
that
external
stimuli
,
including
good
and
bad
smells
,
can
play
a
role
in
positive
and
negative
dreams
.

the
most
common
emotion
experienced
in
dreams
is
anxiety
.
generally
,
negative
emotions
are
much
more
common
than
positive
ones
.

how
to
interpret
your
dreams
blind
people
may
dream
visually
in
one
study
of
people
who
have
been
blind
since
birth
,
they
still
seemed
to
experience
visual
imagery
in
their
dreams
,
and
they
had
eye
movements
that
correlated
to
visual
dream
recall
.

although
they
had
fewer
eye
movements
during
rem
sleep
than
the
sighted
participants
,
the
blind
participants
reported
the
same
dream
sensations
,
including
visual
content
.

you
'
re
paralyzed
while
dreaming
rem
sleep
is
characterized
by
paralysis
of
the
voluntary
muscles
.
this
phenomenon
is
known
as
rem
atonia
and
prevents
you
from
acting
out
your
dreams
while
you
'
re
asleep
.
basically
,
because
motor
neurons
are
not
stimulated
,
your
body
does
not
move
.

in
some
cases
,
this
paralysis
can
even
carry
over
into
the
waking
state
for
as
long
as
10
minutes
,
a
condition
known
as
sleep
paralysis
.

although
the
experience
can
be
frightening
,
it
'
s
perfectly
normal
and
should
last
only
a
few
minutes
before
normal
muscle
control
returns
.

some
dreams
are
universal
although
dreams
are
often
influenced
by
personal
experiences
and
may
serve
important
adaptive
functions
.
people
across
the
globe
report
having
similar
themes
in
their
dreams
,
although
there
may
be
differences
based
on
their
unique
cultural
experiences
and
environments
.

for
example
,
people
from
all
over
the
world
frequently
dream
about
being
chased
,
being
attacked
,
or
falling
.
other
common
dream
experiences
include
feeling
frozen
and
unable
to
move
,
arriving
late
,
flying
,
and
being
naked
in
public
.

why
you
get
vivid
dreams
and
how
to
stop
them
takeaways
dreams
can
range
from
the
fascinating
to
the
anxiety-provoking
to
the
just
plain
weird
.
you
might
wake
up
scratching
your
head
and
wondering
"why
did
i
dream
about
*that*
?
while
there
'
s
a
lot
we
still
don
'
t
know
about
dreaming
,
we
have
discovered
a
number
of
intriguing
facts
that
can
provide
greater
insights
into
how
and
why
we
dream
.

cartesian
dream
skepticism
dream
skepticism
has
traditionally
been
the
most
famous
and
widely
discussed
philosophical
problem
raised
by
dreaming
(
see
williams
1978
;
stroud
1984
)
.
in
the
meditations
,
descartes
uses
dreams
to
motivate
skepticism
about
sensory-based
beliefs
about
the
external
world
and
his
own
bodily
existence
.
he
notes
that
sensory
experience
can
also
lead
us
astray
in
commonplace
sensory
illusions
such
as
seeing
things
as
too
big
or
small
.
but
he
does
not
think
such
cases
justify
general
doubts
about
the
reliability
of
sensory
perception
:
by
taking
a
closer
look
at
an
object
seen
under
suboptimal
conditions
,
we
can
easily
avoid
deception
.
by
contrast
,
dreams
suggest
that
even
in
a
seemingly
best-case
scenario
of
sensory
perception
(
stroud
1984
)
,
deception
is
possible
.
even
the
realistic
experience
of
sitting
dressed
by
the
fire
and
looking
at
a
piece
of
paper
in
one



s
hands
(
descartes
1641
:
i
.
5
)
is
something
that
can
,
and
according
to
descartes
often
does
,
occur
in
a
dream
.

there
are
different
ways
of
construing
the
dream
argument
.
a
strong
reading
is
that
descartes
is
trapped
in
a
lifelong
dream
and
none
of
his
experiences
have
ever
been
caused
by
external
objects
(
the
always
dreaming
doubt
;
see
newman
2019
)
.
a
weaker
reading
is
that
he
is
just
sometimes
dreaming
but
cannot
rule
out
at
any
given
moment
that
he
is
dreaming
right
now
(
the
now
dreaming
doubt
;
see
newman
2019
)
.
this
is
still
epistemologically
worrisome
:
even
though
some
of
his
sensory-based
beliefs
might
be
true
,
he
cannot
determine
which
these
are
unless
he
can
rule
out
that
he
is
dreaming
.
doubt
is
thus
cast
on
all
of
his
beliefs
,
making
sensory-based
knowledge
slip
out
of
reach
.

cartesian-style
skeptical
arguments
have
the
following
form
(
quoted
from
klein
2015
)
:
1
.
if
i
know
that
p
,
then
there
are
no
genuine
grounds
for
doubting
that
p
.

2
.
u
is
a
genuine
ground
for
doubting
that
p
.

3
.
therefore
,
i
do
not
know
that
p
.

if
we
apply
this
to
the
case
of
dreaming
,
we
get
:
1
.
if
i
know
that
i
am
sitting
dressed
by
the
fire
,
then
there
are
no
genuine
grounds
for
doubting
that
i
am
really
sitting
dressed
by
the
fire
.

2
.
if
i
were
now
dreaming
,
this
would
be
a
genuine
ground
for
doubting
that
i
am
sitting
dressed
by
the
fire
:
in
dreams
,
i
have
often
had
the
realistic
experience
of
sitting
dressed
by
the
fire
when
i
was
actually
lying
undressed
in
bed
!

3
.
therefore
,
i
do
not
know
that
i
am
now
sitting
dressed
by
the
fire
.

importantly
,
both
strong
and
weak
versions
of
the
dream
argument
cast
doubt
only
on
sensory-based
beliefs
,
but
leave
other
beliefs
unscathed
.

according
to
descartes
,
that
2+3=5
or
that
a
square
has
no
more
than
4
sides
is
knowable
even
if
he
is
now
dreaming
:
although
,
in
truth
,
i
should
be
dreaming
,
the
rule
still
holds
that
all
which
is
clearly
presented
to
my
intellect
is
indisputably
true
.

lights
,
dreams
do
not
undermine
our
ability
to
engage
in
the
project
of
pure
,
rational
enquiry
(

;

earlier
discussions
of
dream
skepticism
and
why
descartes



version
is
special
dream
arguments
have
been
a
staple
of
philosophical
skepticism
since
antiquity
and
were
so
well
known
that
in
his
objections
to
the
meditations
,
hobbes
(
1641
)
criticized
descartes
for
not
having
come
up
with
a
more
original
argument
.
yet
,
descartes



version
of
the
problem
,
more
than
any
other
,
has
left
its
mark
on
the
philosophical
discussion
.

earlier
versions
tended
to
touch
upon
dreams
just
briefly
and
discuss
them
alongside
other
examples
of
sensory
deception
.
for
example
,
in
the
theaetetus
(
157e
)
,
plato
has
socrates
discuss
a
defect
in
perception
that
is
common
to
dreams
and
diseases
,
including
insanity
,
and
everything
else
that
is
said
to
cause
illusions
of
sight
and
hearing
and
the
other
senses
.

this
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
knowledge
cannot
be
defined
through
perception
.

dreams
also
appear
in
the
canon
of
standard
skeptical
arguments
used
by
the
pyrrhonists
.
again
,
dreams
and
sleep
are
just
one
of
several
conditions
(
including
illness
,
joy
,
and
sorrow
)
that
cast
doubt
on
the
trusthworthiness
of
sensory
perception
(
diogenes
laertius
,
lives
of
eminent
philosophers
;
sextus
empiricus
,
outlines
of
pyrrhonism
)
.

augustine
(
against
the
academics
;
confessions
)
thought
the
dream
problem
could
be
contained
,
arguing
that
in
retrospect
,
we
can
distinguish
both
dreams
and
illusions
from
actual
perception
(
matthew
2005
:
chapter
8
)
.
and
montaigne
(
the
apology
for
raymond
sebond
)
noted
that
wakefulness
itself
teems
with
reveries
and
illusions
,
which
he
thought
were
even
more
epistemologically
worrisome
than
nocturnal
dreams
.

descartes
devoted
much
more
space
to
the
discussion
of
dreaming
and
cast
it
as
a
unique
epistemological
threat
distinct
from
both
waking
illusions
and
evil
genius
or
brain-in-a-vat-style
arguments
.
his
claim
that
he
has
often
been
deceived
by
his
dreams
implies
he
also
saw
dreaming
as
a
real-world
(
rather
than
merely
hypothetical
)
threat
.

this
is
further
highlighted
by
the
intimate
,
first-person
style
of
the
meditations
.
their
narrator
is
supposed
to
exemplify
everyone



s
epistemic
situation
,
illustrating
the
typical
defects
of
the
human
mind
.
readers
are
further
drawn
in
by
descartes



strategy
of
moving
from
commonsense
examples
towards
more
sophisticated
philosophical
claims
(
frankfurt
1970
)
.
for
example
,
descartes
builds
up
towards
dream
skepticism
by
first
considering
familiar
cases
of
sensory
illusions
and
then
deceptively
realistic
dreams
.

finally
,
much
attention
has
been
devoted
to
several
dreams
descartes
reportedly
had
as
a
young
man
.
some
believe
these
dreams
embodied
theoretical
doubts
he
developed
in
the
discourse
and
meditations
(
baillet
1691
;
leibniz
1880
:
iv
;
cole
1992
;
keefer
1996
)
.
hacking
(
2001
:
252
)
suggests
that
for
descartes
,
dream
skepticism
was
not
just
a
philosophical
conundrum
but
a
source
of
genuine
doubt
.
there
is
also
some
discussion
about
the
dream
reports



authenticity
(
freud
1940
;
cole
1992
;
clarke
2006
;
browne
1977
)

dreaming
and
other
skeptical
scenarios
in
the
meditations
,
after
discussing
the
dream
argument
,
descartes
raises
the
possibility
of
an
omnipotent
evil
genius
determined
to
deceive
us
even
in
our
most
basic
beliefs
.
contrary
to
dream
deception
,
descartes
emphasizes
that
the
evil
genius
hypothesis
is
a
mere
fiction
.

still
,
it
radicalizes
the
dream
doubt
in
two
respects
.
one
,
where
the
dream
argument
left
the
knowability
of
certain
general
truths
intact
,
these
are
cast
in
doubt
by
the
evil
genius
hypothesis
.
two
,
where
the
dream
argument
,
at
least
on
the
weaker
reading
,
involves
just
temporary
deception
,
the
evil
genius
has
us
permanently
deceived
.

one
modernized
version
,
the
brain-in-a-vat
thought
experiment
,
says
that
if
evil
scientists
placed
your
brain
in
a
vat
and
stimulated
it
just
right
,
your
conscious
experience
would
be
exactly
the
same
as
if
you
were
still
an
ordinary
,
embodied
human
being
(
putnam
1981
)
.
in
the
matrix-trilogy
(
chalmers
2005
)
,
matrixers
live
unbeknownst
to
themselves
in
a
computer
simulation
.
unlike
the
brain-in-a-vat
,
they
have
bodies
that
are
kept
alive
in
pods
,
and
flaws
in
the
simulation
allow
some
of
them
to
bend
its
rules
to
their
advantage
.

unlike
dream
deception
,
which
is
often
cast
as
a
regularly
recurring
actuality
(
cf
.
windt
2011
)
,
brain-in-a-vat-style
arguments
are
often
thought
to
be
merely
logically
or
nomologically
possible
.
however
,
there
might
be
good
reasons
for
thinking
that
we
actually
live
in
a
computer
simulation
(
bostrom
2003
)
,
and
if
we
lend
some
credence
to
radical
skeptical
scenarios
,
this
may
have
consequences
for
how
we
act
(
schwitzgebel
2017
)
.

even
purely
hypothetical
skeptical
scenarios
may
enhance
their
psychological
force
by
capitalizing
on
the
analogy
with
dreams
.
clark
(
2005
)
argues
that
the
matrix
contains
elements
of


industrial-strength
deception



in
which
both
sensory
experience
and
intellectual
functioning
are
exactly
the
same
as
in
standard
wake-states
,
whereas
other
aspects
are
more
similar
to
the
compromised
reasoning
and
bizarre
shifts
that
are
the
hallmark
of
dreams
.

descartes



solution
to
the
dream
problem
and
real-world
dreams
at
the
end
of
the
sixth
meditation
,
descartes
suggests
a
solution
to
the
dream
problem
that
is
tied
to
a
reassessment
of
what
it
is
like
to
dream
.
contrary
to
his
remarks
in
the
first
meditation
,
he
notes
that
dreams
are
only
rarely
connected
to
waking
memories
and
are
often
discontinuous
,
as
when
dream
characters
suddenly
appear
or
disappear
.

he
then
introduces
the
coherence
test
:
but
when
i
perceive
objects
with
regard
to
which
i
can
distinctly
determine
both
the
place
whence
they
come
,
and
that
in
which
they
are
,
and
the
time
at
which
they
appear
to
me
,
and
when
,
without
interruption
,
i
can
connect
the
perception
i
have
of
them
with
the
whole
of
the
other
parts
of
my
life
,
i
am
perfectly
sure
that
what
i
thus
perceive
occurs
while
i
am
awake
and
not
during
sleep
.

(
meditation
vi
.
24
)
for
all
practical
purposes
,
he
has
now
found
a
mark
by
which
dreaming
and
waking
can
be
distinguished
(
cf
.
meditation
i
.
7
)
,
and
even
if
the
coherence
test
is
not
fail-safe
,
the
threat
of
dream
deception
has
been
averted
.

descartes



remarks
about
the
discontinuous
and
ad
hoc
nature
of
many
dreams
are
backed
up
by
empirical
work
on
dream
bizarreness
(
see
hobson
1988
;
revonsuo
&
salmivalli
1995
)
.
still
,
many
of
his
critics
were
not
convinced
this
helped
his
case
against
the
skeptic
.
even
if
descartes



revised
phenomenological
description
characterizes
most
dreams
,
one
might
occasionally
merely
dream
of
successfully
performing
the
test
(
hobbes
1641
)
,
and
in
some
dreams
,
one
might
seem
to
have
a
clear
and
distinct
idea
but
this
impression
is
false
(
bourdin
1641
)
.
both
the
coherence
test
and
the
criterion
of
clarity
and
distinctness
would
then
be
unreliable
.

how
considerations
of
empirical
plausibility
impact
the
dream
argument
continues
to
be
a
matter
of
debate
.
grundmann
(
2002
)
appeals
to
scientific
dream
research
to
introduce
an
introspective
criterion
:
when
we
introspectively
notice
that
we
are
able
to
engage
in
critical
reflection
,
we
have
good
reason
to
think
that
we
are
awake
and
not
dreaming
.
however
,
this
assumes
critical
reasoning
to
be
uniformly
absent
in
dreams
.
if
attempts
at
critical
reasoning
do
occur
in
dreams
and
if
they
generally
tend
to
be
corrupted
,
the
introspective
criterion
might
again
be
problematic
(
windt
2011
,
2015a
)
.
there
are
also
cases
in
which
even
after
awakening
,
people
mistake
what
was
in
fact
a
dream
for
reality
(
wamsley
et
al
.
2014
)
.
at
least
in
certain
situations
and
for
some
people
,
dream
deception
might
be
a
genuine
cause
of
concern
(
windt
2015a
)
.

2
.
the
ontology
of
dreams
in
what
follows
,
the
term


conscious
experience



is
used
as
an
umbrella
term
for
the
occurrence
of
sensations
,
thoughts
,
impressions
,
emotions
etc
.
in
dreams
(
cf
.
dennett
1976
)
.
these
are
all
phenomenal
states
:
there
is
something
it
is
like
to
be
in
these
states
for
the
subject
of
experience
(
cf
.
nagel
1974
)
.
to
ask
about
dream
experience
is
to
ask
whether
it
is
like
something
to
dream
while
dreaming
,
and
whether
what
it
is
like
is
similar
to
(
or
relevantly
different
from
)
corresponding
waking
experiences
.

are
dreams
experiences
?

cartesian
dream
skepticism
depends
on
a
seemingly
innocent
background
assumption
:
that
dreams
are
conscious
experiences
.
if
this
is
false
,
then
dreams
are
not
deceptive
experiences
during
sleep
and
we
cannot
be
deceived
,
while
dreaming
,
about
anything
at
all
.
whether
dreams
are
experiences
is
a
major
question
for
the
ontology
of
dreams
and
closely
bound
up
with
dream
skepticism
.

the
most
famous
argument
denying
that
dreams
are
experiences
was
formulated
by
norman
malcolm
(
1956
,
1959
)
.
today
,
his
position
is
commonly
rejected
as
implausible
.
still
,
it
set
the
tone
for
the
analysis
of
dreaming
as
a
target
phenomenon
for
philosophy
of
mind
.

for
malcolm
,
the
denial
of
dream
experience
followed
from
the
conceptual
analysis
of
sleep
:


if
a
person
is
in
any
state
of
consciousness
it
logically
follows
that
he
is
not
sound
asleep



(
malcolm
1956
:
21
)
.
following
some
remarks
of
wittgenstein



s
(
1953
:
184
;
see
chihara
1965
for
discussion
)
,
malcolm
claimed
the
concept
of
dreaming
is
derived
,
not
from
dreaming
,
but
from
descriptions
of
dreams
,
i
.
e
.
,
from
the
familiar
phenomenon
that
we
call


telling
a
dream



.
(
malcolm
1959
:
55
)
malcolm
argued
that
retrospective
dream
reports
are
the
sole
criterion
for
determining
whether
a
dream
occurred
and
there
is
no
independent
way
of
verifying
dream
reports
.
while
first-person
,
past-tense
psychological
statements
(
such
as


i
felt
afraid



)
can
at
least
in
principle
be
verified
by
independent
observations
(
but
see
canfield
1961
;
siegler
1967
;
schröder
1997
)
,
he
argued
dream
reports
(
such
as


in
my
dream
,
i
felt
afraid



)
are
governed
by
different
grammars
and

what
exactly
malcolm
means
by


conscious
experience



is
unclear
.

sometimes
he
seems
to
be
saying
that
conscious
experience
is
conceptually
tied
to
wakefulness
(
malcolm
1956
)
;
other
times
he
claims
that
terms
such
as
mental
activity
or
conscious
experience
are
vague
and
it
is
senseless
to
apply
them
to
sleep
and
dreams
(
malcolm

)
.

malcolm



s
analysis
of
dreaming
has
been
criticized
as
assuming
an
overly
strict
form
of
verificationism
and
a
naïve
view
of
language
and
conceptual
change
.
a
particularly
counterintuitive
consequence
of
his
view
is
that
there
can
be
no
observational
evidence
for
the
occurrence
of
dreams
in
sleep
aside
from
dream
reports
.
this
includes
behavioral
evidence
such
as
sleepwalking
or
sleeptalking
,
which
he
thought
showed
the
person
was
partially
awake
;
as
he
also
thought
dreams
occur
in
sound
sleep
,
such
sleep
behaviors
were
largely
irrelevant
to
the
investigation
of
dreaming
proper
.
he
also
claimed
adopting
a
physiological
criterion
of
dreaming
(
such
as
eeg
measures
of
brain
activity
during
sleep
)
would
change
the
concept
of
dreaming
,
which
he
argued
was
tied
exclusively
to
dream
reporting
.
this
claim
was
particularly
radical
as
it
explicitly
targeted
the
discovery
of
rem
sleep
and
its
association
with
dreaming
(
dement
&
kleitman
1957
)
,
which
is
commonly
regarded
as
the
beginning
of
the
science
of
sleep
and
dreaming
.
malcolm



s
position
was
that
the
very
project
of
a
science
of
dreaming
was
misguided
.

contra
malcolm
,
most
assume
that
justification
does
not
depend
on
strict
criteria
with
the
help
of
which
the
truth
of
a
statement
can
be
determined
with
absolute
certainty
,
but


on
appeals
to
the
simplicity
,
plausibility
,
and
predictive
adequacy
of
an
explanatory
system
as
a
whole



(
chihara
&
fodor
1965
:
197
)
.
in
this
view
,
behavioral
and/or
physiological
evidence
can
be
used
to
verify
dream
reports
(
ayer
1960
)
and
the
alleged
principled
difference
between
dream
reports
and
other
first-person
,
past-tense
psychological
sentences
(

putnam
noted
that
malcolm



s
analysis
of
the
concept
of
dreaming
relies
on
the
dubious
idea
that
philosophers
have
access
to
deep
conceptual
truths
that
are
hidden
to
laypeople
:
the
lexicographer
would
undoubtedly
perceive
the
logical
(
or
semantical
)
connection
between
being
a
pediatrician
and
being
a
doctor
,
but
he
would
miss
the
allegedly


logical



character
of
the
connection
between
dreams
and
waking
impressions
.

does
not
exist

(

nagel
argued
that
even
if
one
accepts
malcolm



s
analysis
of
the
concept
of
dreaming
,
it
is
a
mistake
to
invest
the
demonstration
that
it
is
impossible
to
have
experiences
while
asleep
with
more
import
than
it
has
.
it
is
an
observation
about
our
use
of
the
word


experience



,
and
no
more
.
it
does
not
imply
that
nothing
goes
on
in
our
minds
while
we
dream
.

(
nagel

)
whether
dream
thoughts
,
feelings
or
beliefs
should
count
as
real
instances
of
their
kind
now
becomes
an
open
question
,
and
in
any
case
there
is
no
conceptual
contradiction
involved
in
saying
one
has
experiences
while

as
instantaneous

to
ask
about
dream

is
also
to
ask
whether
there
is
something
it
is

to
dream
during

as
opposed

there

dennett



s
(
1976
,
1979
)
cassette
theory
says
dreams
are
the
product
of
instantaneous
memory
insertion
at
the
moment
of
the
awakening
,
as
if
a
cassette
with
pre-scripted
dreams
had
been
inserted
into
memory
,
ready
for
replay
.
dennett
claims
the
cassette
theory
and
the
view
that
dreams
are
experiences
can
deal
equally
well
with
empirical
evidence
for
instance
on
the
relationship
between
dreaming
and
rem
sleep
.
the
cassette
theory
is
preferable
because
it
is
more
parsimonious
,
positing
only
an
unconscious
dream
composition
process
rather
than
an
additional
conscious
presentation
process
in
sleep
.
for
dennett
,
the
important
point
is
that
it
is
impossible
to
distinguish
between
the
two
rival
theories
based
on
dream
recall
;
the
question
of
dream
experience
should
be
settled
by
independent
empirical
evidence
.

while
dennett
shares
malcolm



s
skepticism
about
dream
experience
,
this
latter
claim
is
diametrically
opposed
to
malcolm



s
rejection
of
a
science
of
dreaming
.
for
dennett
,
the
unreliability
of
dream
recall
also
is
not
unique
,
but
exemplifies
a
broader
problem
with
memory
reports
:
we
generally
cannot
use
retrospective
recall
to
distinguish
conscious
experience
from
memory
insertion

version
of
dennett



s
cassette
theory
goes
back
to
maury



s
(
1861
)
description
of
a
long
and
complex
dream
about
the
french
revolution
that
culminated
in
his
execution
at
the
guillotine
,
at
which
point
maury
suddenly
awoke
to
find
that
the
headboard
had
fallen
on
his
neck
.
because
the
dream
seemed
to
systematically
build
up
to
this
dramatic
conclusion
,
which
in
turn
coincided
with
a
sudden
external
event
,
he
suggested
that
such
cases
were
best
explained
as
instantaneous
memory
insertions
experienced
at
the
moment
of
awakening
.

similarly
,
gregory
(
1916
)
described
dreams
are
psychical
explosions
occurring
at
the
moment
of
awakening
.

the
trustworthiness
of
dream
reports
continues
to
be
contentious
.
rosen
(
2013
)
argues
that
dream
reports
are
often
fabricated
and
fail
to
accurately
describe
experiences
occurring
during
sleep
.
by
contrast
,
windt
(
2013
,
2015a
)
argues
that
dream
reports
can
at
least
under
certain
conditions
(
such
as
in
laboratory
studies
,
when
dreams
are
reported
immediately
after
awakening
by
trained
participants
)
be
regarded
as
trustworthy
sources
of
evidence
with
respect
to
previous
experience
during
sleep
.

empirical
evidence
on
the
question
of
dream
experience
unlike
malcolm
,
many
believe
that
whether
dreams
are
experiences
is
an
empirical
question
;
and
unlike
dennett
,
the
predominant
view
is
that
the
empirical
evidence
does
indeed
support
this
claim
(
flanagan
2000
;
metzinger
2003
;
revonsuo
2006
;
rosen
2013
;
windt
2013
,
2015a
)
.

a
first
reason
for
thinking
that
dreams
are
experiences
during
sleep
is
the
relationship
between
dreaming
and
rem
(
rapid
eye
movement
)
sleep
.

researchers
in
the
1950s
discovered
that
sleep
is
not
a
uniform
state
of
rest
and
passivity
,
but
there
is
a
sleep
architecture
involving
different
stages
of
sleep
that
is
relatively
stable
both
within
and
across
individuals
(
aserinsky
&
kleitman
1953
,
1955
;
dement
&
kleitman
1957
)
.
following
sleep
onset
,
periods
of
non-rem
(
or
nrem
)
sleep
including
slow
wave
sleep
(
so
called
because
of
the
presence
of
characteristic
slow-wave
,
high-voltage
eeg
activity
)
are
followed
by
periods
of
high-frequency
,
low-voltage
activity
during
rem
sleep
.
eeg
measures
from
rem
sleep
strongly
resemble
waking
eeg
.
rem
sleep
is
additionally
characterized
by
rapid
eye
movements
and
a
near-complete
loss
of
muscle
tone
(
dement
1999
:
27


50
;
jouvet
1999
)
.

the
alignment
between
conscious
experience
on
the
one
hand
and
wake-like
brain
activity
and
muscular
paralysis
on
the
other
hand
would
seem
to
support
the
experiential
status
of
dreams
as
well
as
explain
the
outward
passivity
that
typically
accompanies
them
.
reports
of
dreaming
are
in
fact
much
more
frequent
following
rem
(
81
.
9%
)
than
nrem
sleep
awakenings
(
43%
;
nielsen
2000
)
.
rem
reports
tend
to
be
more
elaborate
,
vivid
,
and
emotionally
intense
,
whereas
nrem
reports
tend
to
be
more
thought-like
,
confused
,
non-progressive
,
and
repetitive
(
hobson
et
al
.
2000
)
.
these
differences
led
to
the
idea
that
rem
sleep
is
an
objective
marker
of
dreaming
(
dement
&
kleitman
1957
;
hobson
1988
:
154
)
.

attempts
to
identify
dreaming
with
mental
activity
during
rem
sleep
have
not
,
however
,
been
successful
,
and
many
now
hold
that
dreams
can
occur
in
all
stages
of
sleep
(
e
.
g
.
,
antrobus
1990
;
foulkes
1993b
;
solms
1997
,
2000
;
domhoff
2003
;
nemeth
&
fazekas
2018
)
.
in
recent
years
there
has
been
renewed
interest
in
nrem
sleep
for
the
study
of
dreaming
(
noreika
et
al
.
2009
;
siclari
et
al
.
2013
,
2017
)
.
this
suggests
the
inference
from
the
physiology
of
rem
sleep
to
the
phenomenology
of
dreaming
is
not
straightforward
.

a
second
line
of
evidence
comes
from
lucid
dreams
,
or
dreams
in
which
one
knows
one
is
dreaming
and
often
has
some
level
of
dream
control
(
voss
et
al
.
2013
;
voss
&
hobson
2015
;
baird
et
al
.
2019
)
.
the
term
lucid
dreaming
was
coined
by
van
eeden
(
1913
)
,
but
aristotle
(
on
dreams
)
already
noted
that
one
can
sometimes
be
aware
while
dreaming
that
one
is
dreaming
.

scientific
evidence
that
lucid
dreaming
is
real
and
a
genuine
sleep
phenomenon
comes
from
laboratory
studies
(
hearne
1978
;
laberge
et
al
.

1981
)
showing
lucid
dreamers
can
use
specific
,
pre-arranged
patterns
of
eye
movements
(
e
.
g
.
,
right-left-right-left
)
to
signal
in
real-time
that
they
are
now
lucid
and
engaging
in
dream
experiments
.
these
signals
are
clearly
identifiable
on
the
eog
and
suggest
a
correspondence
between
dream-eye
movements
and
real-eye
movements
(
as
predicted
by
the
so-called
scanning
hypothesis
;
see
dement
&
kleitman
1957
;
leclair-visonneau
et
al
.
2010
)
.
retrospective
reports
confirm
that
the
dreamer
really
was
lucid
and
signalled
lucidity
(
dresler
et
al
.
2012
;
stumbrys
et
al
.
2014
)
.

signal-verified
lucid
dreams
have
been
used
to
study
muscular
activity
accompanying
body
movements
in
dreams
(
erlacher
et
al
.
2003
;
dresler
et
al
.
2011
)
,
for
advanced
eeg
analysis
of
brain
activity
during
lucid
dreaming
(
voss
et
al
.
2009
)
,
and
imaging
studies
(
dresler
et
al
.
2011
,
2012
)
.
eye
signals
can
also
be
used
to
measure
the
duration
of
different
activities
performed
in
lucid
dreams
;
contrary
to
the
cassette
theory
,
lucid
dreams
have
temporal
extension
and
certain
dream
actions
even
seem
to
take
slightly
longer
than
in
waking
(
erlacher
et
al
.
2014
)
.
there
have
also
been
attempts
to
induce
lucidity
through
non-invasive
electrical
stimulation
during
sleep
(
stumbrys
et
al
.
2013
;
voss
et
al
.
2014
)
.
the
combination
of
signal-verified
lucid
dreaming
with
volitional
control
over
dream
content
,
retrospective
report
,
and
objective
sleep
measures
has
been
proposed
to
provide
controlled
conditions
for
the
study
of
conscious
experience
in
sleep
and
a
new
methodology
for
investigating
the
relationship
between
conscious
experience
and
neurophysiological
processes
(
baird
et
al
.
2019
)
.

a
third
line
of
evidence
(
revonsuo
2006
:
77
)
comes
from
dream-enactment
behavior
(
nielsen
et
al
.
2009
)
,
most
prominently
in
patients
with
rem-sleep
behavior
disorder
(
rbd
;
schenck
&
mahowald
1996
;
schenck
2005
;
leclair-visonneau
et
al
.
2010
)
.
due
to
a
loss
of
the
muscular
atonia
that
accompanies
rem
sleep
in
healthy
subjects
,
these
patients
show
complex
,
seemingly
goal-directed
outward
behaviors
such
as
running
or
fighting
off
an
attacker
during
rem
sleep
.
retrospective
dream
reports
often
match
these
behaviors
,
suggesting
that
patients
literally
act
out
their
dreams
during
sleep
.

while
persuasive
,
these
lines
of
evidence
might
not
satisfy
skeptics
about
dream
experience
.
they
might
worry
that
results
from
lucid
dreaming
and
dream
enactment
do
not
generalize
to
ordinary
,
non-lucid
dreams
;
they
might
also
construe
alternative
explanations
that
do
not
require
conscious
experience
in
sleep
.
there
are
also
methodological
concerns
,
for
instance
about
how
closely
sleep-behaviors
actually
match
dream
experience
.
a
key
issue
is
that
to
support
the
experiential
status
of
dreams
,
evidence
from
sleep
polysomnography
,
signal
verified
lucid
dreams
,
or
sleep
behavior
requires
convergence
with
retrospective
dream
reports
.
this
means
trusting
dream
reports
is
built
into
any
attempt
to
empirically
resolve
the
question
of
dream
experience



which
then
invites
the
familiar
skeptical
concerns
.
again
,
an
anti-skeptical
strategy
may
be
to
appeal
to
explanatory
considerations
.
in
this
view
,
the
convergence
of
dream
reports
and
objective
polysomnographic
or
behavioral
observations
is
best
explained
by
the
assumption
that
dreams
are
experiences
in
sleep
,
and
this
assumption
is
strengthened
by
further
incoming
findings
.
this
strategy
places
dream
reports
at
the
center
of
scientific
dream
research
while
avoiding
the
contentious
claim
that
their
trustworthiness
,
and
with
it
the
experiential
status
of
dreams
,
can
be
demonstrated
conclusively
by
independent
empirical
means
(
windt
2013
,
2015a
)

dreams
and
hallucinations
even
where
philosophers
agree
dreams
are
experiences
,
they
often
disagree
on
how
exactly
to
characterize
dreaming
relative
to
wake-state
psychological
terms
.
often
,
questions
about
the
ontology
of
dreaming
intersect
with
epistemological
issues
.
increasingly
,
they
also
incorporate
empirical
findings
.

the
standard
view
is
that
dreams
have
the
same
phenomenal
character
as
waking
perception
in
that
they
seemingly
put
us
in
contact
with
mind-independent
objects
,
yet
no
such
object
is
actually
being
perceived
.
this
means
dreams
count
as
hallucinations
in
the
philosophical
sense
(
crane
&
french
2017
;
macpherson
2013
)
.
even
if
,
in
a
particularly
realistic
dream
,
my
visual
experience
was
exactly
as
it
would
be
if
i
were
awake
(
i
could
see
my
bedroom
,
my
hands
on
the
bed
sheets
,
etc
.
)
,
as
long
as
my
eyes
were
closed
during
the
episode
,
i
would
not
,
literally
,
be
seeing
anything
.

there
is
some
controversy
in
the
psychological
literature
about
whether
dreams
should
be
regarded
as
hallucinations
.
some
believe
the
term
hallucination
should
be
reserved
for
clinical
contexts
and
wake-state
pathologies

view
that
dreams
involve
hallucinations
is
implicit
in
descartes



assumption
that
even
when
dreaming
,
it
is
certain
that
i
seem
to
see
light
,
hear
a
noise
,
and
feel
heat
;
this
cannot
be
false
,
and
this
is
what
in
me
is
properly
called
perceiving
(
sentire
)
.
(
descartes
1641
:
ii
.
9
)
it
also
lies
at
the
heart
of
aristotle



s
(
on
dreams
)
assumption
that
dreams
result
from
the
movements
of
the
sensory
organs
that
continue
even
after
the
original
stimulus
has
ceased
.
he
believed
that
in
the
silence
of
sleep
,
these
residual
movements
result
in
vivid
sensory
imagery
that
is
subjectively
indistinguishable
from
genuine
perception
(

.

the
assumption
of
phenomenological
equivalence
between
dream
and
waking
experience
can
also
be
found
in
berkeley

claim
that
the
existence
of
external
bodies
is
not
necessary
for
the
production
of
vivid
,
wake-like
perceptual
experience
.
similarly
,
russell
defended
sense-data
theory
by
noting
that
in
dreams
,
i
have
all
the
experiences
that
i
seem
to
have
;
it
is
only
things
outside
my
mind
that
are
not
as
i
believe
them
to
be
while
i
am
dreaming
.
(

elsewhere
,
he
argued
dreams
and
waking
life
must
be
treated
with
equal
respect
;
it
is
only
by
some
reality
not
merely
sensible
that
dreams
can
be
condemned
.
(

hume
was
less
clear
on
this
matter
,
proposing
that
dreams
occupy
an
intermediate
position
between
vivid
and
largely
non-voluntary
sensory
impressions
and
ideas
,
or


the
faint
images
of

and
reasoning

on

one

wanted
to

.
on

other
hand
,
he
acknowledged
that
in

approach

dreams
do
not
fit

into

s
attempt
to
draw
a
dichotomous
distinction
between
impressions
,
including
perception
,
and
ideas
,
including
sensory
imagination
(
ryle
1949
;
waxman

;
broughton

)
.

phenomenologists
often
focus
not
so
much
on
the
quality
of
dream
imagery
as
on
the
overall
character
of
experience
,
noting
that
dreams
are
experienced
as
reality
;
as
in
waking
perception
,
we
simply
feel
present
in
a
world
.
this
also
sets
dreams
apart
from
waking
fantasy
and
daydreams
(
husserl
1904/1905
;
uslar
1964
;
conrad
1968
;
globus
1987
:
89
.

at
its
strongest
,
the
hallucination
view
claims
that
dreaming
and
waking
experience
are
identical
in
both
the
quality
of
sensory
imagery
and
their
overall
,
self-in-a-world
structure
(
revonsuo
2006
:
84
)
.
this
claim
is
central
to
the
virtual
reality
metaphor
,
according
to
which
consciousness
itself
is
dreamlike
and
waking
perception
a
kind
of
online
hallucination
modulated
by
the
senses
(
llinás
&
ribary

;
llinás
&
paré
1991
;
revonsuo
2006
;
metzinger
2003
,
2009
)
.

this
seems
to
be
empirically
supported
.
neuroimaging
studies
(
dang-vu
et
al
.
2007
;
nir
&
tononi
2010
;
desseilles
et
al
.
2011
)
show
that
the
predominance
of
visual
and
motor
imagery
as
well
as
strong
emotions
in
dreams
is
paralleled
by
high
activation
of
the
corresponding
brain
areas
in
rem
sleep
,
which
may
exceed
waking
;
at
the
same
time
,
the
cognitive
deficits
often
thought
to
characterize
dreams
such
as
the
loss
of
self-awareness
,
the
absence
of
critical
thinking
,
delusional
reasoning
,
and
mnemonic
deficits
fit
in
well
with
the
comparative
deactivation
of
frontal
areas
(
hobson
et
al
.
2000
)
.
hobson
(
1988
,
hobson
et
al
.
2000
)
has
argued
that
the
vivid
,
hallucinatory
character
of
dreaming
results
from
the
fact
that
in
rem
sleep
,
the
visual
and
motor
areas
are
activated
in
the
same
way
as
in
waking
perception
,
the
sole
difference
being
dreams



dependence
on
internal
signal
generation
.

horikawa
and
colleagues
(
2013
)
used
neuroimaging
data
from
sleep
onset
to
predict
the
types
of
objects
described
in
mentation
reports
,
which
they
took
to
support
the
perceptual
equivalence
between
dreaming
and
waking
.

generally
,
versions
of
the
hallucination
view
that
suggest
dreams
replicate
all
aspects
of
waking
perception
are
too
vague
to
be
informative
.
especially
for
subtle
perceptual
activities
(
such
as
visual
search
)
,
we
might
not
know
enough
about
dream
phenomenology
to
make
any
strong
claims
(
nielsen
2010
)
.
specifying
points
of
similarity
leads
to
a
more
informative
and
precise
,
but
likely
also
more
nuanced
view
.
dreams
are
heterogeneous
,
and
some
might
be
more
perception-like
while
others
resemble
imagination
(
windt
2015a
)
.
there
might
also
be
differences
between
or
even
within
specific
types
of
imagery
.
for
example
,
visual
imagery
might
be
quite
different
from
touch
sensations
,
which
tend
to
be
rare
in
dreams
(
hobson
1988
)
.
visual
dream
imagery
might
overall
resemble
waking
perception
but
lack
color
saturation
,
background
detail
and
focus
(
rechtschaffen
&
buchignani
,
1992
)
.

classifying
dreams
as
either
hallucinatory
or
imaginative
is
further
complicated
by
the
fact
that
there
is
strong
overlap
in
cortical
activity
associated
with
both
visual
imagery
and
perception
(
zeidman
&
maguire
,
2016
)
.
this
means
even
a
strong
overlap
in
cortical
activity
between
,
say
,
visual
dream
imagery
and
visual
perception
does
not
necessarily
set
dreaming
apart
from
waking
imagination
.

this
is
also
true
for
evidence
on
eye
movements
in
dreams
.
laberge
and
colleagues
(
2018
)
recently
showed
that
eye
tracking
of
objects
is
smooth
in
lucid
dreaming
and
perceiving
,
but
not
in
imagining
.
drawing
from
this
evidence
,
rosen
(
forthcoming
)
suggests
many
dreams
mimic
the
phenomenology
of
interacting
with
a
stable
world
,
including
eye
movements
and
visual
search
.
others
argue
we
should
not
analogize
dream
imagery
to
mind-independent
,
scannable
objects
and
that
eye
movements
might
instead
be
implicated
in
the
generation
of
dream
imagery
(
windt
2018
)
.

5
dreams
and
illusions
another
way
to
make
sense
of
the
claim
that
dreaming
has
the
same
phenomenal
character
as
waking
perception
is
to
say
some
kinds
of
dream
imagery
are
illusory
:
they
involve
misperception
of
an
external
object
as
having
different
properties
than
it
actually
has
(
cf
.
smith
2002
;
crane
&
french
2017
)
.
the
illusion
view
disagrees
with
the
hallucination
view
on
whether
dreams
have
a
contemporaneous
external
stimulus
source
.

the
illusion
view
has
fallen
out
of
favor
but
has
a
long
history
.
the
ancients
believed
dreams
have
bodily
sources
.
this
idea
underlies
the
practice
of
using
dreams
to
diagnose
illness
,
as
practiced
in
the
shrines
at
epidaurus
(
galen
on
diagnosis
in
dreams
;
van
de
castle
1994
)
.
aristotle
(
on
dreams
)
thought
some
dreams
are
caused
by
indigestion
,
and
hobbes
adopted
this
view
,
claiming
different
kinds
of
dreams
could
be
traced
to
different
bodily
sensations
.
for
instance
,


lying
cold
breedeth
dreams
of
feare
,
and
raiseth
the
thought
and
image
of
some
fearfull
object



(
hobbes
1651
:
91
)
.

appeals
to
the
bodily
sources
of
dreaming
became
especially
popular
in
the
19^th
and
early
20^th
centuries
.
many
believed
specific
dream
themes
such
as
flying
were
linked
to
sleeping
position
(
macnish
1838
;
scherner
1861
;
vold
1910/1912
;
ellis
1911
)
and
realizing
,
in
sleep
,
that
one



s
feet
are
not
touching
the
ground
(
bergson
1914
)
.

there
were
also
attempts
to
explain
the
phenomenology
of
dreaming
by
appealing
to
the
absence
of
outward
movement
.
the
lack
of
appropriate
feedback
and
of
movement
and
touch
sensations
was
thought
to
cause
dreams
of
being
unable
to
move
(
bradley
1894
)
or
of
trying
but
failing
to
do
something
(
gregory
1918
)
.

some
proponents
of
the


leibreiztheorie



(
or
somatic-stimulus
theory
)
of
dreaming
attempted
to
go
beyond
anecdotal
observations
to
conduct
controlled
experiments
.
weygandt
(
1893
)
investigated
the
influence
of
various
factors
including
breathing
,
blood
circulation
,
temperature
changes
,
urge
to
urinate
,
sleeping
position
,
and
visual
or
auditory
stimulation
during
sleep
on
dream
content
(
see
schredl
2010
for
details
)
.
singer
(
1924
)
proposed
experiments
on
stimulus
incorporation
in
dreams
can
inform
claims
on
the
ontology
of
dreaming
:
if
dreams
are
sensations
,
a
particular
auditory
stimulus
should
increase
the
frequency
of
dreams
in
nearby
sleepers
as
well
as
the
frequency
of
sound
in
their
dreams
,
and
it
should
decrease
the
range
of
quality
and
intensity
of
these
dreams
,
making
them
overall
more
similar
and
predictable
.

newer
studies
provide
evidence
for
the
incorporation
of
external
stimuli
in
dreams
,
including
light
flashes
,
sounds
,
sprays
of
water
applied
to
the
skin
(
dement
&
wolpert
1958
)
,
thermal
(
baldridge
1966
)
,
electrical
(
koulack
1969
)
,
and
verbal
stimuli
(
berger
1963
;
breger
et
al
.
1971
;
hoelscher
et
al
.
,
1981
)
,
as
well
as
blood
pressure
cuff
stimulation
on
the
leg
(
nielsen
et
al
.
1995
;
sauvageau
et
al
.
1998
)
.

muscular
activity
also
often
leaves
its
mark
on
dreams
.
it
occurs
throughout
sleep
but
is
especially
frequent
in
rem
sleep
,
mostly
in
the
form
of
twitching
but
occasionally
also
in
the
form
of
larger
,
seemingly
goal-directed
movements
(
blumberg
2010
;
blumberg
&
plumeau
2016
)
.
the
relation
between
outward
and
dream
movements
is
complex
:
in
some
cases
,
outward
movements
might
mirror
dream
movements
,
while
in
others
,
sensory
feedback
might
prompt
dream
imagery
(
windt
2018
)
.

generally
,
it
seems
external
and
bodily
stimuli
can
be
related
to
varying
degrees
to
dream
and
sleep
onset
imagery
(
nielsen
2017
;
windt
2018
;
windt
et
al
.
2016
)
.
some
of
these
cases
appear
to
fit
the
concept
of
illusion
,
as
in
when
the
sound
of
the
alarm
clock
is
experienced
,
in
a
dream
,
as
a
siren
,
or
when
blood
pressure
cuff
inflation
on
the
leg
leads
to
dreams
of
wearing
strange
shoes
(
windt
2018
;
for
these
and
other
examples
,
see
nielsen
et
al
.
1995
)
.
in
other
cases
,
such
as
when
blood
pressure
cuff
stimulation
on
the
leg
prompts
a
dream
of
seeing
someone
else



s
leg
being
run
over
,
describing
this
as
illusory
misperception
might
be
less
straightforward
.

saying
that
dreams
can
be
prompted
by
external
stimuli
and
that
in
some
cases
these
are
best
described
as
illusions
is
different
from
the
stronger
claim
,
sometimes
advanced
by
historical
proponents
of
somatic-stimulus
theory
,
that
dreams
generally
are
caused
by
external
or
bodily
stimuli
.
as
an
example
of
the
stronger
claim
,
consider
wundt



s
proposal
that
the
ideas
which
arise
in
dreams
come
,
at
least
to
a
great
extent
,
from
sensations
,
especially
from
those
of
the
general
sense
,
and
are
therefore
mostly
illusions
of
fancy
,
probably
only
seldom
pure
memory
ideas
which
hence
become
hallucinations
.
(
wundt
1896
:
179
)
this
claim
is
likely
too
strong
.
it
is
also
likely
that
appeals
to
external
or
bodily
stimuli
on
their
own
cannot
fully
explain
dream
imagery
,
including
when
and
how
external
stimuli
are
incorporated
in
dreams
.
sensory
incorporation
in
dreams
is
often
hard
to
predict
and
indirect
;
associated
imagery
seems
related
not
just
to
stimulus
intensity
,
but
also
to
short-
and
long
term
memories
.
a
full
explanation
of
dream
content
additionally
has
to
take
the
cognitive
and
memory
sources
of
dreaming
into
account
(
windt

6
dreams
as
imaginative
experiences
the
most
important
rival
to
the
hallucination
view
is
that
dreams
are
imaginative
experiences
(
liao
&
gendler
2019
;
thomas
2014
)
.
this
can
mean
dream
imagery
involves
imaginings
rather
than
percepts
(
including
hallucinations
or
illusions
;
mcginn
2004
)
,
that
dream
beliefs
are
imaginative
and
not
real
beliefs
(
sosa
2007
)
,
or
both
(
ichikawa
2008
,
2009
)
.
an
important
advantage
is
that
by
assimilating
dreams
to
commonplace
mental
states
such
as
waking
fantasy
and
daydreaming
,
rather
than
a
rare
and
often
pathological
occurrence
such
as
hallucinations
,
it
provides
a
more
unified
account
of
mental
life
(
stone
1984
)
.
however
,
the
reasons
for
adopting
the
imagination
view
are
diverse
,
and
dreams
have
been
proposed
to
resemble
imaginings
and
differ
from
perception
along
a
number
of
dimensions
(
e
.
g
.
mcginn
2004
,
2005a
,
b
;
thomas
2014
)
.
this
issue
is
complicated
by
the
fact
that
there
is
little
agreement
on
the
definition
of
imagination
and
its
relation
to
perception
(
kind
2013
)
.

one
way
is
to
deny
dreams
involve
presence
or
the
feeling
of
being
in
a
world
,
which
many
believe
is
central
to
waking
perception
.
imagination
theorists
compare
the
sense
in
which
we
feel
present
in
our
dreams
to
cognitive
absorption
,
as
when
we
are
lost
in
a
novel
,
film
,
or
vivid
daydream
(
sartre
1940
;
mcginn
2004
;
but
see
hering
1947
;
globus
1987
)
.

some
argue
that
reflexive
consciousness
or
meta-awareness
(
as
in
lucid
dreams
)
interrupts
cognitive
absorption
and
terminates
the
ongoing
dream
(
sartre
1940
)
,
essentially
denying
lucid
dreams
are
possible
.

another
issue
is
whether
dreams
are
subject
to
the
will
(
ichikawa
2009
)
.
imagination
is
often
characterized
as
active
and
under
our
control
(
wittgenstein
1967
:
621
,
633
)
,
involving


a
special
effort
of
the
mind



(
descartes
1641
:
vi
,
2
)
,
whereas
perception
is
passive
.

because
dreams
just
seem
to
happen
to
us
without
being
under
voluntary
control
,
they
present
an
important
challenge
for
the
imagination
view
.

ichikawa
(
2009
)
argues
lucid
control
dreams
show
dreams
are
generally
subject
to
the
will
even
where
they
are
not
under
deliberate
control
.

dreams
are
widely
described
as
more
indeterminate
than
waking
perception
(
james
1890
:
47
;
stone
1984
)
.
in
scientific
dream
research
,
vagueness
is
regarded
as
one
of
three
main
subtypes
of
bizarreness
(
hobson
1988
;
revonsuo
&
salmivalli
1995
)
.
an
example
are
dream
characters
who
are
identified
not
by
their
behavior
or
looks
,
but
by
just
knowing
(
kahn
et

dreams
are
also
attention-dependent
and
lack
foreground-background
structure
(
thompson
2014
)
;
while
it
is
tempting
to
construe
the
dream
world
as
rich
in
detail
,
there
is
no
more
to
dreams
than
meets
the
eye
,
and
many
think
dream
experience
is
exhausted
by
what
is
the
focus
of
selective
attention
(
hunter
1983
;
thompson
2014
)
.

indeterminacy
is
also
related
to
the
question
of
whether
we
dream
in
color
or
in
black
and
white
.
based
on
a
review
of
historical
and
recent
studies
,
schwitzgebel
(
2002
,
2011
)
argues
there
has
been
a
shift
in
theories
on
dream
color
that
coincides
with
the
rise
first
of
black-and-white
and
then
color
television
.
he
argues
it
is
unlikely
that
dreams
themselves
changed
from
colored
to
black
and
white
and
back
to
colored
,
proposing
that
a
change
in
opinion
is
a
more
plausible
explanation
.
maybe
dreams
were
either
black
and
white
or
colored
all
along
;
or
maybe
they
are
indeterminate
with
respect
to
color
,
as
may
be
the
case
for
imagined
or
fictional
objects
;
were
this
the
case
,
it
would
strengthen
the
imagination
view
(
ichikawa
2009
)
.
schwitzgebel



s
main
point
is
that
reports
of
colored
dreaming
are
unreliable
and
our
opinions
about
dreams
can
be
mistaken
(
but
see
windt
2013
,
2015a
)
.
this
relates
to
schwitzgebel



s
(
2011
;
hurlburt
&
schwitzgebel
2007
)
general
skepticism
about
the
reliability
of
introspection
.

the
issue
of
dream
color
has
led
to
a
number
of
follow-up
studies
(
schwitzgebel
2003
;
schwitzgebel
et
al
.
2006
;
murzyn
2008
;
schredl
et
al
.
2008
;
hoss
2010
)
.
they
suggest
most
people
dream
in
color
and
a
small
percentage
describe
grayscale
or
even
mixed
dreams
(
murzyn
2008
)
or
dreams
involving
moderate
color
saturation
(
rechtschaffen
and
buchignani
1992
)
.
indeterminacy
is
rarely
reported
.

the
imagination
view
has
consequences
for
cartesian
dream
skepticism
.

if
dream
pain
does
not
feel
like
real
pain
,
there
is
a
fail-safe
way
to
determine
whether
one
is
now
dreaming
:
one
need
only
pinch
oneself
(
nelson
1966
;
stone
1984
;
but
see
hodges
&
carter
1969
;
kantor

)
.

as
locke
put
it
,
if
our
dreamer
pleases
to
try
,
whether
the
glowing
heat
of
a
glass
furnace
,
be
barely
a
wandering
imagination
in
a
drowsy
man



s
fancy
,
by
putting
his
hand
into
it
,
he
may
perhaps
be
wakened
into
a
certainty
greater
than
he
could
wish
,
that
it
is
something
more
than
bare
imagination
.
(
locke
1689
:
iv
.
xi
.
8
)
if
dreaming
feels
different
from
waking
,
this
raises
the
question
why
we
tend
to
describe
dreams
in
the
same
terms
as
waking
perception
.

maybe
this
is
because
most
people
haven



t
thought
about
these
matters
and
they
would
find
the
imagination
view
plausible
if
they
considered
it
(
ichikawa
2009
)
.
or
maybe
it
is
just
because
we
all
know
that
dreams
are
throughout
unlike
waking
experiences
that
we
can
safely
use
ordinary
expressions
in
the
narration
of
them
.
(
austin
1962
:
42
)
some
authors
classify
dreams
as
imaginings
while
acknowledging
they
feel
like
perceiving
.
for
example
,
hobbes
describes
dreams
as


the
imaginations
of
them
that
sleep



(
hobbes
1651
:
90
)
,
and
imagination
as
a


decaying
sense



(
hobbes
1651
:
88
)
.
yet
he
also
uses
the
concepts
of
imagination
and
fancy
to
describe
perception
and
argues


their
appearance
to
us
is
fancy
,
the
same
waking
,
that
dreaming



(
hobbes
1651
:
86
)
.

in
the
scientific
literature
,
the
imagination
view
is
complemented
by
cognitive
theories
.
foulkes
(
1978
:
5
)
describes
dreaming
as
a
form
of
thinking
with
its
own
grammar
and
syntax
,
but
allows
that
dream
imagery
is
sufficently
perception-like
to
deceive
us
.
domhoff



s
neurocognitive
model
of
dreaming
(
2001
,
2003
)
emphasizes
the
dependence
of
dreaming
on
visuospatial
skills
and
on
a
network
including
the
association
areas
of
the
forebrain
.
the
theory
draws
from
findings
on
the
partial
or
global
cessation
of
dreaming
following
brain
lesions
(
cf

solms

,

,

that
dreaming
develops
gradually
and
in

visuospatial
skills

children
(

and

content

supporting
the

dreaming
and
waking
mind
wandering
a
number
of
researchers
have
begun
to
consider
dreaming
in
the
context
of
theories
of
mind
wandering
.
mind
wandering
is
frequent
in
waking
and
involves
spontaneous
thoughts
that
unfold
dynamically
and
are
only
weakly
constrained
by
ongoing
tasks
and
environmental
demands
(
schooler
et
al
.
2011
;
smallwood
&
schooler
2015
;
christoff
et
al
.
2016
)
.
based
on
phenomenological
and
neurophysiological
similarities
,
dreams
have
been
proposed
to
be
an
intensified
form
of
waking
mind
wandering
(
pace-schott
2007
,
2013
;
domhoff
2011
;
wamsley
2013
;
fox
et
al
.
2013
)
.

this
basic
idea
seems
to
have
been
anticipated
by
leibniz
,
who
noted
that
the
spontaneous
formation
of
visions
in
dreams
surpasses
the
capacity
of
our
waking
imagination
(
leibniz
,
philosophical
papers
and
letters
,
vol
.
i
,
177


178
)
.

the
analogy
between
dreams
and
waking
mind
wandering
has
been
discussed
in
the
context
of
cognitive
agency
.
metzinger
(
2013a
,
b
,
2015
)
describes
dreams
and
waking
mind
wandering
as
involving
a
cyclically
recurring
loss
of
mental
autonomy
,
or
the
ability
to
deliberately
control
one



s
conscious
thought
processes
.
dreams
and
waking
mind
wandering
are
not
mental
actions
but
unintentional
mental
behaviors
,
comparable
to
subpersonal
processes
such
as
breathing
or
heartbeat
.
because
dreaming
and
waking
mind
wandering
make
up
a
the
majority
of
our
conscious
mental
lives
,
he
argues
that
cognitive
agency
and
mental
autonomy
are
the
exception
,
not
the
rule
.

this
raises
the
question
of
how
to
make
sense
of
lucid
control
dreams
,
which
involve
both
meta-awareness
and
agency
.
windt
and
voss
(
2018
)
argue
that
in
such
cases
,
spontaneous
processes
including
imagery
formation
co-exist
alongside
more
deliberate
,
top-down
control
;
they
also
argue
metacognitive
insight
and
control
themselves
can
have
spontaneous
elements
.
this
suggests
spontaneity
and
control
are
not
opposites
,
but
a
more
complex
account
is
needed
.
possibly
,
certain
dreams
and
instances
of
waking
mind
wandering
can
be
both
spontaneous
and
agentive
.

the
analogy
with
mind
wandering
might
help
move
forward
the
debate
on
the
ontology
of
dreaming
.
in
this
debate
,
a
common
assumption
is
that
dreams
can
be
categorized
as
either
hallucinatory
or
imaginative
.
yet
the
application
of
these
terms
to
dreams
quickly
runs
into
counterexamples
and
it
is
unclear
they
are
mutually
exclusive
.
one
option
is
pluralism
(
rosen
2018b
)
,
in
which
some
aspects
of
dreaming
are
hallucinatory
,
others
imaginative
,
and
yet
again
others
illusory
.

another
is
that
dreams
are
sui
generis
,
combining
aspects
associated
with
wake
states
such
as
hallucinating
,
imagining
,
or
perceiving
in
a
novel
manner
without
mimicking
them
completely
.
windt
(
2015a
)
proposes
that
mind
wandering
,
which
describes
a
range
of
mental
states
loosely
characterized
by
their
spontaneous
and
dynamic
character
,
might
be
particularly
suitable
for
the
characterization
of
dreaming
precisely
because
that
term
leaves
open
more
specific
questions
on
the
phenomenology
of
dreaming
,
allowing
for
variation
in
control
,
determinacy
,
and
so
on
.
this
might
be
a
good
starting
point
for
describing
what
is
unique
about
dreaming
while
also
acknowledging
continuities
across
sleep-wake
states
and
capitalizing
on
the
strengths
of
the
hallucination
,
illusion
,
imagination
,
and
cognitive
views
.

the
problem
of
dream
belief
the
second
strand
of
the
imagination
view
argues
that
dream
beliefs
are
not
real
beliefs
,
but
propositional
imaginings
.
this
may
or
may
not
be
combined
with
the
claim
that
dream
imagery
is
imaginative
rather
than
perceptual
(
sosa
2007
;
ichikawa
2009
)
.

denying
that
dream
beliefs
have
the
status
of
real
beliefs
only
makes
sense
before
the
background
of
a
specific
account
of
what
beliefs
are
and
how
they
are
distinguished
from
other
mental
states
such
as
delusions
or
propositional
imaginings
.
for
instance
,
ichikawa
(
2009
)
argues
that
if
we
follow
interpretationist
or
dispositionalist
accounts
of
belief
,
dream
beliefs
fall
short
of
real
beliefs
.
he
claims
dream
beliefs
lack
connection
with
perceptual
experience
and
fail
to
motivate
actions
;
consequently
,
they
do
not
have
the
same
functional
role
as
real
beliefs
.
moreover
,
we
cannot
ascribe
dream
beliefs
to
a
person
by
observing
them
lying
asleep
in
bed
.
dream
beliefs
are
often
inconsistent
with
longstanding
waking
beliefs
and
acquired
and
discarded
without
any
process
of
belief
revision
(
ichikawa
2009
)
.

this
analysis
of
dream
beliefs
has
consequences
for
skepticism
.
if
dream
beliefs
are
propositional
imaginings
,
then
we
do
not
falsely
believe
while
dreaming
that
we
are
now
awake
,
but
only
imagine
that
we
do
(
sosa
2007
)
.
it
is
not
clear
though
that
this
protects
us
from
deception
.
if
dream
beliefs
fall
short
of
real
beliefs
,
this
might
even
make
the
specter
of
dream
deception
more
worrisome
:
in
mistaking
dream
beliefs
for
the
real
thing
,
we
would
now
be
deceived
about
the
status
of
our
own
mental
states
(
ichikawa
2008
)
.

it
is
also
not
clear
whether
the
same
type
of
argument
extends
to
mental
states
other
than
beliefs
.
as
lewis
points
out
,
a
person
might
in
fact
believe
or
realize
in
the
course
of
a
dream
that
he
was
dreaming
,
and
even
if
we
said
that
,
in
such
case
,
he
only
dreamt
that
he
was
dreaming
,
this
still
leaves
it
possible
for
someone
who
is
asleep
to
entertain
at
the
time
the
thought
that
he
is
asleep
.

(
lewis
1969
:
133
)
mental
states
other
than
believing
such
as
entertaining
,
thinking
,
or
minimally
appraisive
instances
of
taking
for
granted
might
be
sufficient
for
deception
(
reed
1979
)
.

the
debate
about
dream
beliefs
is
paralleled
by
a
debate
about
whether
delusions
are
beliefs
or
imaginings
(
see
currie
2000
;
currie

ravenscroft

2004
;
bayne
&
pacherie
2005
;
bortolotti
2009
;
gendler
2013
)
.
both
debates
might
plausibly
inform
each
other
,
especially
as
dreams
are
sometimes
proposed
to
be
delusional
(
hobson
1999
)
.

dreaming
and

dreaming
as
a
model
system
and
test
case
for
consciousness
research
dreams
are
a
global
state
of
consciousness
in
which
experience
arises
under
altered
behavioral
and
neurophysiological
conditions
as
compared
to
standard
wakefulness
;
unlike
other
altered
states
of
consciousness
(
such
as
drug-induced
or
deep
meditative
states
)
and
pathological
wake
states
(
such
as
psychosis
or
neurological
syndromes
)
,
dreams
occur
spontaneously
and
regularly
in
healthy
subjects
.
for
both
reasons
,
many
regard
dreams
as
a
test
case
for
theories
of
consciousness
or
even
an
ideal
model
system
for
consciousness
research
(
churchland
1988
;
revonsuo
2006
)
.

existing
proposals
differ
on
the
phenomenology
of
dreaming
:
referring
to
dream
bizarreness
,
churchland
describes
dream
experience
as
robustly
different
from
waking
,
whereas
revonsuo
argues
dreaming
is
similar
to
waking
and
the
purest
form
of
experience
:
the
dreaming
brain
brings
out
the
phenomenal
level
of
organization
in
a
clear
and
distinct
form
.
dreaming
is
phenomenality
pure
and
simple
,
untouched
by
external
physical
stimulation
or
behavioural
activity
.
(
revonsuo
2006
:
75
)
revonsuo
argues
dreaming
reveals
the
basic
,
state-independent
structure
of
consciousness
to
be
immersive
:


dreaming
depicts
consciousness
first
and
foremost
as
a
subjective
world-for-me



(
revonsuo
2006
:
75
)
.
this
leads
him
to
introduce
the


world-simulation
metaphor
of
consciousness



,
according
to
which
consciousness
itself
is
essentially
simulational
and
dreamlike
.
this
is
taken
to
support
internalism
about
conscious
experience
.

this
latter
claim
is
also
contentious
.
noë
(
2004
:
213
)
argues
that
phenomenological
differences
between
dreaming
and
waking
(
such
as
greater
instability
of
visual
dream
imagery
)
result
from
the
lack
of
dynamic
interaction
with
the
environment
in
dreams
.
he
proposes
this
shows
that
neural
states
are
sufficient
for
dreaming
but
denies
they
are
also
sufficient
for
perceptual
experience
.

a
possible
problem
for
both
views
is
their
reliance
on
background
assumptions
about
the
phenomenology
of
dreaming
and
its
disconnection
from
environmental
stimuli
and
bodily
sensations
.
windt
(
2015a
,
2018
)
argues
both
internalism
and
externalism
mistakenly
assume
dreams
to
be
isolated
from
external
sensory
input
and
own-body
perception
;
she
believes
both
the
phenomenology
of
dreaming
and
its
correlation
with
external
stimuli
are
complex
and
variable
.
she
argues
the
analysis
of
dreaming
does
not
clearly
support
either
side
in
the
debate
on
internalism
vs
externalism
(
but
see
rosen
2018a
)
.
generally
,
in
the
absence
of
a
well
worked
out
theory
of
dreaming
and
its
sleep-stage
and
neural
correlates
,
proposals
for
using
dreaming
as
a
model
system
or
test
case
run
the
risk
of
relying
on
an
oversimplified
description
of
the
target
phenomenon
(
windt
&
noreika
2011
)
.

recent
accounts
appealing
to
generative
models
and
predictive
processing
(
clark
2013b
;
hohwy
2013
)
suggest
a
new
,
unified
account
of
perception
,
imagination
,
and
dreaming
.
in
these
accounts
,
different
mental
states
,
including
perception
and
action
,
embody
different
strategies
of
hypothesis
testing
and
prediction
error
minimization
.

perception
is
the
attempt
to
model
the
hidden
external
causes
of
sensory
stimuli
;
action
involves
keeping
the
internal
model
stable
while
changing
the
sensory
input
.
clark
argues
that
on
such
a
model
,
systems
that
know
how
to
perceive
an
object
as
a
cat
are
thus
systems
that
,
ipso
facto
,
are
able
to
use
a
top-down
cascade
to
bring
about
the
kinds
of
activity
pattern
that
would
be
characteristic
of
the
presence
of
a
cat
.
[


]
perceivers
like
us
,
if
this
is
correct
,
are
inevitably
potential
dreamers
and
imaginers
too
.
moreover
,
they
are
beings
who
,
in
dreaming
and
imagining
,
are
deploying
many
of
the
very
same
strategies
and
resources
used
in
ordinary
perception
.
(
clark
2013a
:
764
)
predictive
processing
accounts
have
also
been
used
to
explain
specific
features
of
dreaming
.
bizarreness
has
been
associated

the
comparative
lack
of
external

dream
imagery

)
.
windt
(
2018
)
suggests
a
predictive
processing
account
of
dream
imagery
generation
that
links
bodily
self-experience
to
own-body
perception
and
subtle
motor
behaviors
such
as
twitching
in
rem
sleep
(
blumberg
2010
;
blumberg
&
plumeau
2016
)
.
she
argues
that
movement
sensations
in
dreams
,
in
relation
to
rem-sleep
related
muscle
twitching
,
involve
a
form
of
bodily
self-sampling
in
which
coordinated
muscular
activity
contributes
to
the
generation
and
maintenance
of
a
body
model
.
this
is
important
because
in
predictive
processing
accounts
neither
the
bodily
nor
the
external
causes
of
sensory
inputs
are
known
;
at
the
same
time
,
having
an
accurate
body
model
is
a
prerequisite
for
action
,
requiring
the
system
to
disambiguate
between
self-
and
other
generated
changes
to
sensory
inputs
.
especially
in
early
development
,
sleep
might
provide
the
ideal
conditions
for
exploring
one



s
own
body
via
subtle
but
coordinated
muscular
activity
while
processing
of
visual
and
auditory
stimuli
is
reduced
.

dreams
have
also
been
suggested
as
a
test
case
for
whether
phenomenal
consciousness
can
be
divorced
from
cognitive
access
(
e
.
g
.
,
block
2007
;
but
see
cohen
&
dennett
2011
)
.
sebastián
(
2014a
)
argues
that
dreams
provide
empirical
evidence
that
conscious
experience
can
occur
independently
of
cognitive
access
.
this
is
because
during
(
non-lucid
)
rem-sleep
dreams
,
the
dorsolateral
prefrontal
cortex
(
dlpfc
)
as
the
most
plausible
mechanism
underlying
cognitive
access
is
selectively
deactivated
(
see
also
pantani
et
al
.
2018
)
.
this
would
challenge
theories
linking
conscious
experience
to
access
,
such
as
higher-order-thought
theory
(
sebastián
2014b
)
.
however
,
both
the
hypoactivation
of
the
dlpcf
in
rem
sleep
and
its
association
with
cognitive
access
have
been
debated
.
fazekas
and
nemeth
(
2018
)
suggest
that
certain
kinds
of
cognitive
access
may
be
independent
of
dlpfc
activation
,
necessitating
a
more
complex
account
.

dreams
,
psychosis
,
and
delusions
dreaming
has
been
suggested
as
a
model
system
not
just
of
waking
consciousness
in
general
,
but
also
of
psychotic
wake
states
in
particular
.
the
analogy
between
dreaming
and
madness
has
a
long
philosophical
history
(
plato
,
phaedrus
;
kant
1766
;
schopenhauer
1847
)
and
finds
particularly
stark
expression
in
hobson



s
claim
that


dreaming
is
not
a
model
of
a
psychosis
.
it
is
a
psychosis
.
it



s
just
a
healthy
one



(
hobson
1999
:
44
)
.
gottesmann
(
2006
)
proposes
dreaming
as
a
neurophysiological
model
of
schizophrenia
.
there
is
a
rich
discussion
on
the
theoretical
and
methodological
implications
of
dream
research
for
psychiatry
(
see
scarone
et
al
.
2007
;
d



agostino
et

2013
;
see
windt
&
noreika
2011
as
well
as
the
other
papers
in
this
special
issue
)
and
a
number
of
studies
have
investigated
differences
in
dream
reports
from
schizophrenic
and
healthy
subjects
(
limosani
et
al
.
2011a
,

)
.

rather
than
likening
dreaming
to
waking
in
general
or
specific
wake
states
such
as
psychosis
,
there
have
also
been
attempts
to
compare
specific
dream
phenomena
to
wake-state
delusions
.
gerrans
(
2012
,
2013
,
2014
)
focuses
on
character
misidentification
in
dreams
and
delusions
of
hyperfamiliarity
(
such
as
the
frégoli
delusion
,
in
which
strangers
are
mistakenly
identified
as
family
members
,
and
déjà
vu
)
to
argue
that
anomalous
experience
and
faulty
reality
testing
both
play
a
role
in
delusion
formation
.
rosen
(
2015
)
analyzes
instances
of
thought
insertion
and
of
auditory
hallucinations
,
which
are
key
symptoms
of
schizophrenia
,
to
raise
broader
questions
about
the
altered
sense
of
agency
in
dreams
as
compared
to
waking

beyond
dreams
:
dreamless
sleep
experience
and
the
concepts
of
sleep
,
waking
,
and
consciousness
philosophers
have
focused
almost
exclusively
on
dreaming
,
largely
leaving
to
the
side
questions
about
dreamless
sleep
including
whether
it
is
uniformly
unconscious
.
in
recent
years
there
has
been
a
surge
of
interest
in
the
possibility
of
dreamless
sleep
experience
and
foundational
issues
about
the
definition
of
sleep
and
waking
.
this
has
been
paralleled
by
growing
interest
in
dreaming
in
nrem
sleep
.

conceptually
,
interest
in
dreamless
sleep
experience
has
been
facilitated
by
the
precise
definition
of
dreaming
offered
by
simulation
views
(
revonsuo
et
al
.
2015
)
.
if
dreams
are
immersive
sleep
experiences
characterized
by
their
here-and-now
structure
,
it
makes
sense
to
ask
whether
this
is
true
for
all
or
just
a
subset
of
sleep-related
experiences
and
whether
non-immersive
sleep
experiences
exist
.
by
contrast
,
if
dreaming
is
broadly
identified
with
any
conscious
mentation
in
sleep
(
pagel
et
al
.
2001
)
,
there
is
no
conceptual
space
for
dreamless
sleep
experience
.

following
thompson
'
s
(
2014
,
2015
)
discussion
of
dreamless
sleep
in
indian
and
buddhist
philosophy
,
windt
and
colleagues
(
2016
;
see
also
windt
2015b
)
introduce
a
framework
for
different
kinds
of
dreamless
sleep
experience
ranging
from
thinking
and
isolated
imagery
,
perception
,
or
bodily
sensations
,
where
these
lack
integration
into
a
scene
,
to
minimal
kinds
of
experience
lacking
imagery
or
specific
thought
contents
.
a
possible
example
of
minimal
phenomenal
experience
in
sleep
are
white
dreams
,
where
people
report
having
had
experiences
during
sleep
but
cannot
remember
any
details
.
taken
at
face
value
,
some
white
dream
reports
might
describe
experiences
that
lack
reportable
content
(
windt
2015b
)
;
others
might
describe
forgotten
dreams
or
dreams
with
degraded
content
(
fazekas
et
al
.
2018
)
.
another
example
are
reports
of
witnessing
dreamless
sleep
,
as
described
in
certain
meditation
practices
.
this
state
is
said
to
involve
non-conceptual
awareness
of
sleep
,
again
in
the
absence
of
imagery
or
specific
thought
contents
,
and
loss
of
sense
of
self
(
thompson
2014
,
2015
)
.
some
schools
in
buddhist
philosophy
explain
claims
of
deep
and
dreamless
sleep
by
saying
we
never
fully
lose
consciousness
in
sleep
(
prasad
2000
,
66
;
and
thompson
2014
,
2015
)
.

empirically
,
interest
in
dreamless
sleep
experience
is
paralleled
by
increasing
interest
in
experiences
in
nrem
sleep
(
fazekas
et
al
.
2018
)
.

most
researchers
now
accept
that
dreaming
is
not
confined
to
rem
sleep
,
but
also
occurs
at
sleep
onset
and
in
nrem
sleep
.
the
deeper
stages
of
nrem
sleep
are
particularly
interesting
as
they
involve
roughly
similar
proportions
of
dreaming
,
unconscious
sleep
,
and
white
dreams
(
noreika
et
al
.
2009
:
siclari
et
al
.
2013
,
2017
)
.
in
the
search
for
the
neural
correlates
of
dreaming
vs
unconscious
dreamless
sleep
,
this
makes
comparisons
within
the
same
sleep
stage
possible
and
avoids
confounds
involved
in
comparing
presumably
dreamful
rem
sleep
with
presumably
dreamless
nrem
sleep
.
findings
suggest
that
activity
in
the
same
parietal
hot
zone
underlies
dreaming
in
both
nrem
and
rem
sleep
(
siclari
et
al
.
2017
)
.

where
sleep
and
dream
research
have
traditionally
tried
to
identify
the
sleep
stage
correlates
of
dreaming
,
newer
research
suggests
local
changes
occurring
independently
of
sleep
stages
might
in
fact
be
more
relevant
.
traditionally
regarded
as
global
,
whole-brain
phenomena
,
there
is
now
increasing
evidence
that
sleep
itself
is
locally
driven
,
and
local
changes
in
sleep
depth
might
be
associated
with
changes
in
sleep-related
experience
(
siclari
&
tononi
2017
;
andrillon
et
al
.

2019
)
.
while
sleep
and
dream
research
are
often
considered
as
separate
fields
,
changes
in
how
sleep
in
general
and
sleep
stages
in
particular
are
defined
appear
closely
associated
with
changes
in
the
theoretical
conception
of
dreaming
and
its
empirical
investigation
.

historically
,
discoveries
about
dreaming
have
precipitated
changing
conceptions
of
sleep
(
for
an
excellent
history
of
the
study
of
sleep
and
dreaming
,
see
kroker
2007
)
.
following
aristotle
(
on
sleeping
and
waking
)
,
sleep
was
traditionally
defined
in
negative
terms
as
the
absence
of
wakefulness
and
perception
.
this
is
still
reflected
in
malcolm



s
assumption
that


to
a
person
who
is
sound
asleep
,


dead
to
the
world



,
things
cannot
even
seem



(
malcolm
1956
:
26
)
.
with
the
discovery
of
rem
sleep
,
sleep
came
to
be
regarded
as
a
heterogeneous
phenomenon
characterized
by
the
cyclic
alteration
of
different
sleep
stages
.
rem
sleep
was
now
considered
as


neither
sleeping
nor
waking
.

it
was
obviously
a
third
state
of
the
brain
,
as
different
from
sleep
as
sleep
is
from
wakefulness



(
jouvet
1999
:
5
)
.
the
folk-psychological
dichotomy
between
sleep
and
wakefulness
now
seemed
oversimplified
and
empirically
implausible
.
at
the
same
time
dreaming
,
which
had
previously
been
considered
as
an
intermediate
state
of
half-sleeping
and
half-waking
,
came
to
be
regarded
as
a
genuine
sleep
phenomenon
,
but
narrowed
to
rem
sleep
.
today
,
the
framework
for
describing
dreams
and
other
sleep-related
experiences
is
more
precise
,
but
dreaming
has
also
been
cast
adrift
from
rem
sleep
.

a
closely
associated
issue
is
how
to
define
waking
.
crowther



s
(
2018
)
capacitation
thesis
casts
waking
consciousness
as
a
state
in
which
the
individual
is
fully
switched
on
to
their
environment
,
but
also
to
their
own
epistemic
(
cf
.
o



shaugnessy
2002
)
and
agentive
potential
;
the
waking
individual
is
empowered
to
act
and
think
in
certain
ways
,
though
this
potential
need
not
be
actualized
.
by
contrast
,
dreaming
is
an


imagining-of
consciousness



(
o



shaughnessy
2002
:
430
)
and
consciousness
is
conceptually
tied
to
wakefulness
.
because
in
lucid
dreams
,
the
epistemic
and
agentive
profile
of
waking
is
at
least
partly
realized
,
they
might
,
according
to
crowther
,
be
regarded
as
closer
to
waking
than
nonlucid
dreams
.

this
account
of
waking
and
sleep
may
also
have
consequences
for
the
imagination
model
of
dreaming
and
dream
skepticism
(
soteriou
2017
)
.
as
in
the
imagination
model
,
dreaming
would
be
passive
and
action
,
including
cognitive
agency
,
would
be
tied
to
waking
.
if
dreaming
nonetheless
involved
passive
episodes
of
imagining
oneself
to
be
active
,
one
would
be
unable
to
tell
that
one
were
dreaming
and
imagining
,
as
this
insight
would
require
the
exercise
of
real
agency
.

the
sceptical
consequence
would
be
that
when
dreaming
,
one
would
lose
agency
as
well
as
the
capacity
to
gain
insight
into
one



s
current
state
.
yet
our
ability
to
know
we
are
waking
when
waking
would
be
unscathed
;
according
to
soteriou
,
waking
would
thus
have
an
epistemic
function
connected
to
the
capacity
to
exercise
agency
over
our
mental
lives
.

finally
,
definitions
of
consciousness
themselves
are
bound
up
with
conceptions
of
sleep
and
dreaming
.
as
dreaming
went
from
a
state
whose
experiential
status
was
doubted
to
being
widely
recognized
as
a
second
global
state
of
consciousness
,
consciousness
sometimes
came
to
be
defined
contrastively
as
that
which
disappears
in
deep
,
dreamless
sleep
and
reappears
in
waking
and
dreaming
(
searle
2000
;
tononi
2008
)
.
in
light
of
dreamless
sleep
experience
,
such
definitions
are
problematic
(
thompson
2014
,
2015
;
windt
2015b
;
windt
et
al
.
2016
)
.
dreamless
sleep
experience
has
been
proposed
to
be
particularly
relevant
for
understanding
minimal
phenomenal
experience
,
or
the
conditions
under
which
the
simplest
kind
of
conscious
experience
arises
(
windt
2015b
)
.

the
investigation
of
dreamless
sleep
might
thus
shed
light
on
the
transition
from
unconscious
sleep
to
sleep-related
experience
.

.
dreaming
and
the
self
we
almost
always
have
a
self
in
dreams
,
though
this
self
can
sometimes
be
a
slightly
different
(
e
.
g
.
older
or
younger
)
version
of
our
waking
self
or
even
a
different
person
entirely
.
dreams
therefore
raise
interesting
questions
about
the
identity
between
the
dream
and
waking
self
.
locke
(
1689
)
invites
us
to
imagine
two
men
alternating
in
turns
between
sleep
and
wakefulness
and
sharing
one
continuously
thinking
soul
(
locke
1689
:
ii
.
i
.
12
)
.
he
argues
that
if
one
man
retained
no
memory
of
the
soul



s
thoughts
and
perceptions
while
it
was
linked
to
the
other
man



s
body
,
they
would
be
distinct
persons
.
his
position
is
that
personal
identity
depends
on
psychological
continuity
,
including
recall
:
in
the
absence
of
recall
,
as
illustrated
by
the
toy
example
of
two
people
sharing
one
soul
,
continuous
conscious
thinking
does
not
suffice
for
identity
.
locke
also
rejects
the
possibility
of
unrecalled
dreams
and
the
idea
that
we
dream
throughout
sleep
,
remembering
only
a
small
proportion
of
our
dreams
(
locke
1689
:
ii
.
i
.
19
)
.

valberg
distinguishes
between
the
subject
of
the
dream
(
i
.
e
.
,
the
dream
self
)
and
the
sleeping
person
who
is
the
dreamer
of
the
dream
and
recalls
it
upon
awakening
(
valberg
2007
)
.
he
argues
that
awakening
from
a
dream
involves
crossing
a
chasm
between
discrete
worlds
with
discrete
spaces
and
times
;
it
does
not
make
sense
to
say
that


the


i



at
these
times
[is]
a
single
individual
who
crosses
from
one
world
to
the
other



(
valberg
2007
:
69
)
.
according
to
valberg
,
this
is
relevant
to
dream
skepticism
because
there
is
no
simple
way
to
make
sense
of
the
claims
that
it
is
i
who
emerge
from
a
dream
or
that
i
was
the
victim
of
dream
deception
.

vicarious
dreams
,
or
dreams
in
which
the
protagonist
of
the
dream
seems
to
be
a
different
person
from
the
dreamer
,
are
particularly
puzzling
with
respect
to
identity
.
they
may
even
raise
the
question
of
whether
the
dream
self
has
an
independent
existence
(
rosen
&
sutton
2013
:
1047
)
.
such
dreams
are
superficially
similar
to
cases
in
which
we
imagine
being
another
person
,
but
according
to
rosen
and
sutton
require
a
different
explanation
:
in
the
case
of
dreaming
,
the
imagined
person



s
thoughts
are
not
framed
as
diverging
from
one



s
own
and
one
does
not
retain
one



s
own
perspective
in
addition
to
the
imagined
one
;
in
nonlucid
dreams
,
only
the
perspective
of
the
dream



s
protagonist
is
retained
.

the
dream
self
is
also
at
the
center
of
simulation
views
of
dreaming
,
which
define
dreaming
via
its
immersive
,
here
and
now
character
as
the
experience
of
a
self
in
a
world
.
this
leads
to
further
questions
about
the
phenomenology
of
self-experience
in
dreams
and
how
it
is
different
from
waking
self-experience
.
different
versions
of
the
simulation
view
focus
on
different
aspects
of
self-
and
world
experience
in
dreams
,
ranging
from
social
simulation
(
revonsuo
et
al
.
2015
)
to
the
typical
features
of
selfhood
in

to
the
minimal
conditions
for
experiencing
oneself
as
a
self
in
dreams
and
what
this
tells
us
about
minimal
phenomenal
selfhood
in
general
(
windt

)
.
yet
these
different
versions
of
the
simulation
view
are
largely
complementary
and
together
have
forged
unity
in
a
field
that
was
previously
hampered
by
lack
of
agreement
about
the
definition
of
dreaming
.
they
also
integrate
the
philosophy
of
dreaming
and
scientific
dream
research
.

as
so
often
in
debates
about
dreaming
,
there
is
disagreement
about
basic
phenomenological
questions
.
revonsuo
(
2005
)
describes
self-experience
including
bodily
experience
in
dreams
as
identical
to
waking
,
whereas
metzinger
(
2003
,
2009
;
see
also
windt
&
metzinger
2007
)
argues
that
important
layers
of
waking
self-experience
(
such
as
autobiographical
memory
,
agency
,
a
stable
first-person
perspective
,
metacognitive
insight
,
and
self-knowledge
)
are
missing
in
nonlucid
dreams
.
he
argues
this
is
due
to
the
cognitive
and
mnemonic
deficit
that
characterizes
nonlucid
dreams
(
cf
.
hobson
et
al
.
2000
)
.
windt
(
2015a
)
analyzes
the
range
of
cognitive
and
bodily
self-experience
in
dreams
,
both
of
which
she
describes
as
variable
.
she
argues
that
in
a
majority
of
cases
,
dreams
are
weakly
phenomenally
embodied
states
in
which
bodily
experience
is
largely
related
to
movement
sensations
but
a
detailed
and
integrated
body
representation
is
lacking
;
instead
,
bodily
experience
in
dreams
is
largely
indeterminate
(
for
an
attempt
to
test
this
empirically
,
see
koppehele-gossel
et
al
.
2016
)
.
she
proposes
this
is
because
dreams
are
also
weakly
functionally
embodied
states
,
in
which
the
specific
pattern
of
bodily
experience
reflects
altered
processing
of
bodily
sensations
(
as
in
the
illusion
view
)
.
she
also
analyzes
instances
of
bodiless
dreams
,
in
which
dreamers
say
they
experienced
themselves
as
disembodied
entities
,
to
argue
that
self-experience
can
be
reduced
to
pure
spatiotemporal-self-location
(
windt
2010
)
;
she
proposes
these
cases
can
help
identify
the
conditions
for
the
emergence
of
minimal
phenomenal
selfhood

immorality
and
moral
responsibility
in
dreams
how
the
phenomenology
of
dreaming
compares
to
waking
and
what
to
say
about
how
the
dream
self
relates
to
the
waking
self
bears
on
questions
about
the
moral
status
of
dreams
.
for
augustine
(
confessions
)
dreams
were
a
cause
of
moral
concern
because
of
their
indistinguishability
from
waking
life
.
what
particularly
worried
him
about
dreams
of
sexual
acts
was
their
vividness
,
as
well
as
the
feeling
of
pleasure
and
seeming
acquiescence
or
consent
on
the
part
of
the
dreamer
.
he
concluded
,
however
,
that
the
transition
from
sleep
to
wakefulness
involves
a
radical
chasm
,
enabling
the
dreamer
to
awaken
with
a
clear
conscience
and
absolving
them
from
taking
responsibility
for
their
dream
actions
.

what
exactly
augustine
thought
the
chasm
between
dreaming
and
waking
consists
in
allows
for
different
interpretations
(
matthews
1981
)
.

firstly
,
if
the
dream
and
waking
self
are
not
identical
,
then
waking
augustine
is
not
morally
responsible
for
dream-augustine



s
actions
.

secondly
,
actions
performed
in
dreams
might
be
morally
irrelevant
because
they
did
not
really
happen
.
and
thirdly
,
assuming
that
moral
responsibility
requires
the
ability
to
act
otherwise
,
dreams
provide
no
grounds
for
moral
concern
because
we
cannot
refrain
from
having
certain
types
of
dreams
.

the
issue
of
dream
immorality
may
also
present
a
choice
point
between
different
accounts
of
moral
evaluation
.
where
internalists
assume
the
moral
status
of
a
person



s
actions
is
entirely
determined
by
internal
factors
such
as
intentions
and
motives
,
externalists
look
beyond
these
to
the
effects
of
actions
.
driver
(
2007
)
argues
that
the
absurdity
of
dream
immorality
itself
should
count
against
purely
internalist
accounts
;
yet
she
also
acknowledges
this
absurdity
is
not
a
necessary
feature
of
dreams
.

central
to
the
question
of
dream
immorality
is
the
status
of
dreams
as
actions
rather
than
mere
behaviors
.
mullane
(
1965
)
argues
that
while
we
don



t
have
full
control
over
our
dreams
,
they
are
not
completely
involuntary
either
;
as
is
the
case
for
blushing
,
considerable
effort
is
required
to
attain
control
over
our
dreams
and
in
some
cases
they
can
even
be
considered
as
actions
.
that
lucid
dream
control
is
,
to
some
extent
,
a
learnable
skill
(
stumbrys
et
al
.
2014
)
lends
some
support
to
this
claim
.

1
the
meaning
of
dreams
philosophical
discussions
of
dreaming
tend
to
focus
on
(
a
)
dream
deception
and
(
b
)
questions
about
the
ontology
of
dreaming
,
its
moral
status
,
etc
.
,
that
tend
to
intersect
with
dream
skepticism
.
by
contrast
,
the
main
source
of
interest
in
dreams
outside
of
philosophy
traditionally
has
been
dream
interpretation
and
whether
dreams
are
a
source
of
knowledge
and
insight
.
historically
,
the
epistemic
status
of
dreams
and
the
use
of
prophetic
and
diagnostic
dreams
was
not
just
a
theoretical
,
but
a
practical
problem
(
barbera
2008
)
.
different
types
of
dreams
were
distinguished
by
their
putative
epistemic
value
.

artemidorus
,
for
instance
,
used
the
term
enhypnion
to
refer
to
dreams
that
merely
reflect
the
sleeper



s
current
bodily
or
psychological
state
and
hence
do
not
merit
further
interpretation
,
whereas
he
reserved
the
term
oneiron
for
meaningful
and
symbolic
dreams
of
divine
origin
.

the
practice
of
dream
interpretation
was
famously
attacked
by
aristotle
in
on
prophecy
in
sleep
.
he
denied
that
dreams
are
of
divine
origin
,
but
allowed
that
occasionally
,
small
affections
of
the
sensory
organs
as
might
stem
from
distant
events
that
cannot
be
perceived
in
waking
are
perceptible
in
the
quiet
of
sleep
.
he
also
believed
such
dreams
were
mostly
likely
to
occur
in
dullards
whose
minds
resemble
an
empty
desert



an
assessment
that
was
not
apt
to
encourage
interest
in
dreams
(
kroker
2007
:
37
)
.
a
similarly
negative
view
was
held
by
early
modern
philosophers
who
believed
dreams
were
often
the
source
of
superstitious
beliefs
(
hobbes
1651
;
kant
1766
;
schopenhauer
1847
)
.

in
freudian
dream
theory
,
dream
interpretation
once
more
assumed
a
prominent
role
as
the
royal
road
to
knowledge
of
the
unconscious
.
this
was
associated
with
claims
about
the
psychic
sources
of
dreaming
.
freud
(
1899
)
also
rejected
the
influence
of
external
or
bodily
sources
,
as
championed
by
contemporary
proponents
of
somatic-stimulus
theory
.

in
the
neuroscience
of
dreaming
,
hobson
famously
argued
that
dreams
are
the
product
of
the
random
,
brain-stem
driven
activation
of
the
brain
during
sleep
(
hobson
1988
)
and
at
best
enable
personal
insights
in
the
same
way
as
a
rorschach
test
(
hobson
et
al
.
2000
)
.
dennett
(
1991
)
illustrates
the
lack
of
design
underlying
the
production
of
dream
narratives
through
the


party
game
of
psychoanalysis



,
which
involves
an
aimless
game
of
question-and-answer
.
in
the
game
,
players
follow
simple
rules
to
jointly
produce
narratives
that
can
seem
symbolic
and
meaningful
,
even
though
no
intelligent
and
deliberate
process
of
narration
was
involved
.

even
if
we
grant
that
dreams
are
not
messages
from
a
hidden
entity
in
need
of
decoding
,
this
does
not
imply
that
dream
interpretation
cannot
be
a
personally
meaningful
source
of
insight
and
creativity
(
hobson
&
wohl
2005
)
.
whether
and
under
which
conditions
,
and
following
which
methods
,
dream
interpretation
can
lead
to
personally
significant
insights
is
an
empirical
question
that
is
only
beginning
to
be
investigated
systematically
(
see
edwards
et
al
.
2013
)
.

finally
,
throughout
history
,
views
on
the
epistemic
status
of
dreams
and
the
type
of
knowledge
to
be
gained
from
dream
interpretation
(

g
.
,
knowledge
about
the
future
,
diagnosis
of
physical
illness
,
or
insights
about
one



s
current
concerns
)
often
changed
in
tandem
with
views
on
the
origin
and
sources
of
dreaming
,
which
gradually
moved
from
divine
origins
and
external
sources
,
via
the
body
,
to
the
unconscious
,
and
finally
to
the

2
the
functions
of
dreaming
different
theories
on
the
functions
of
dreaming
have
been
proposed
and
the
debate
is
ongoing
.
an
important
distinction
is
between
the
functions
of
sleep
stages
and
the
functions
of
dreaming
.

well-documented
functions
of
rem
sleep
include
thermoregulation
and
the
development
of
cortical
structures
in
birds
and
mammals
,
as
well
as
neurotransmitter
repletion
,
the
reconstruction
and
maintenance
of
little-used
brain
circuits
,
the
structural
development
of
the
brain
in
early
developmental
phases
,
as
well
as
the
preparation
of
a
repertoire
of
reflexive
or
instinctive
behaviors
(
hobson
2009
)
.
yet
none
of
these
functions
are
obviously
linked
to
dreaming
.
an
exception
is
protoconsciousness
theory
,
in
which
rem
sleep
plays
an
important
role
in
foetal
development
by
providing
a
virtual
world
model
even
before
the
emergence
of
full-blown
consciousness
(
hobson
2009
:
808
)
.

numerous
studies
have
investigated
the
contribution
of
sleep
to
memory
consolidation
,
with
different
sleep
stages
promoting
different
types
of
memories
(
diekelmann
et
al
.
2009
;
walker
2009
)
.
however
,
only
a
few
studies
have
investigated
the
relationship
between
dream
content
and
memory
consolidation
in
sleep
(
for
a
review
,
see
nielsen
&
stenstrom
2005
)
.
dreams
rarely
involve
episodic
replay
of
waking
memories
(
fosse
et
al
.
2003
)
.
the
incorporation
of
memory
sources
seems
to
follow
a
specific
temporal
pattern
in
which
recent
memories
are
integrated
with
older
but
semantically
related
memories
(
blagrove
et
al
.
2011
)
.
nielsen
(
2017
)
presents
a
model
of
how
external
and
bodily
stimuli
on
one
hand
and
short-
and
long-term
memories
on
the
other
hand
form
seemingly
novel
,
complex
,
and
dreamlike
images
at
sleep
onset
;
he
proposes
these
microdreams
shed
light
on
the
formation
and
sources
of
more
complex
dreams
.
there
is
also
some
evidence
that
dream
imagery
might
be
associated
with
memory
consolidation
and
task
performance
after
sleep
,
though
this
is
preliminary
(
wamsley
&
stickgold
2009
,
2010
;
wamsley
et
al
.
2010
)
.

prominent
theories
on
the
function
of
dreaming
focus
on
bad
dreams
and
nightmares
.
it
has
long
been
thought
that
dreaming
contributes
to
emotional
processing
and
that
this
is
particularly
obvious
in
the
dreams
of
nightmare
sufferers
or
in
dreams
following
traumatic
experiences
(
e
.
g
.
,
hartmann
1998
;
nielsen
&
lara-carrasco
2007
;
levin
&
nielsen
2009
;
cartwright
2010
;
perogamvros
et
al
.
2013
)
.
based
on
the
high
prevalence
of
negative
emotions
and
threatening
dream
content
,
threat
simulation
theory
suggests
that
the
evolutionary
function
of
dreaming
lies
in
the
simulation
of
ancestral
threats
and
the
rehearsal
of
threatening
events
and
avoidance
skills
in
dreams
has
an
adaptive
value
by
enhancing
the
individual



s
chances
of
survival
(
see
revonsuo
2000
;
valli
2008
)
.
a
more
recent
proposal
is
social
simulation
theory
,
in
which
social
imagery
in
dreams
supports
social
cognition
,
bonds
,
and
social
skills
.
(
revonsuo
et
al
.
2015
)
.

an
evolutionary
perspective
can
also
be
fruitfully
applied
to
specific
aspects
of
dream
phenomenology
.
according
to
the
vigilance
hypothesis
,
natural
selection
disfavored
the
occurrence
of
those
types
of
sensations
during
sleep
that
would
compromise
vigilance
(
symons
1993
)
.

dream
sounds
,
but
also
smells
or
pains
might
distract
attention
from
the
potentially
dangerous
surroundings
of
the
sleeping
subject
,
and
the
vigilance
hypothesis
predicts
that
they
only
rarely
occur
in
dreams
without
causing
awakening
.
by
contrast
,
because
most
mammals
sleep
with
their
eyes
closed
and
in
an
immobile
position
,
vivid
visual
and
movement
hallucinations
during
sleep
would
not
comprise
vigilance
and
thus
can
occur
in
dreams
without
endangering
the
sleeping
subject
.

focusing
on
the
stuff
dreams
are
not
made
of
might
then
be
at
least
as
important
for
understanding
the
function
of
dreaming
as
developing
a
positive
account
.

finally
,
even
if
dreaming
in
general
and
specific
types
of
dream
content
in
particular
were
found
to
be
strongly
associated
with
specific
cognitive
functions
,
it
would
still
be
possible
that
dreams
are
mere
epiphenomena
of
brain
activity
during
sleep
(
flanagan
1995
,
2000
)
.
it
is
also
possible
that
the
function
of
dreams
is
not
knowable
(
springett
2019
)
.

a
particular
problem
for
any
theory
on
the
function
of
dreaming
is
to
explain
why
a
majority
of
dreams
are
forgotten
and
how
dreams
can
fulfill
their
putative
function
independently
of
recall
.
crick
and
mitchinson
(
1983
)
famously
proposed
that
rem
sleep


erases



or
deletes
surplus
information
and
unnecessary
memories
,
which
would
suggest
that
enhanced
dream
recall
is
counterproductive
.
another
problem
is
that
dreaming
can
be
lost
selectively
and
independently
of
other
cognitive
deficits
(
solms
1997
,
2000
)
.

some
of
the
problems
that
arise
for
theories
on
the
functions
of
dreaming
can
be
avoided
if
we
do
not
assume
that
dreaming
has
a
specific
function
,
separate
from
the
function
(
s
)
of
conscious
wakeful
states
.
this
depends
on
the
broader
taxonomy
of
dreaming
in
relation
to
wakeful
states
.
for
example
,
if
dreaming
is
continuous
with
waking
mind
wandering
,
imagination
,
and/or
own-body
perception
,
we
should
not
expect
it
to
have
a
unique
function
,
but
rather
to
express
a
similar
function
as
these
wakeful
states
,
perhaps
to
varying
degrees
.
nor
should
we
expect
dreams
to
have
a
single
function
;
the
functions
of
dreaming
might
be
as
varied
and
complex
as
those
of
consciousness
,
and
given
the
complexity
of
the
target
phenomenon
,
the
failure
to
pin
down
a
single
function
should
not
be
surprising
(
windt
2015a
)
.

involves
creating
an
intention
to
recognize
when

carrying
that

into

to
use
the

phrase

tends
to

"eight

two"
it
'
s
not
exactly
"one
small
step
for
man
,
"
but
that
humble
mathematical
message
is
extraordinary
in
its
own
way
.
the
first
part



"eight
minus
six"



was
transmitted
by
a
scientist
to
a
place
just
as
exotic
as
the
moon
yet
frequented
by
each
of
us
.
the
response



"two"



came
from
the
mind
of
a
sleeping
research
subject
as
he
snoozed
in
a
neuroscience
laboratory
outside
chicago
.

you
see
,
"eight
minus
six
.
.
.
two"
is
a
dialogue
between
two
people



one
of
whom
was
asleep
and
dreaming
.

"it
'
s
authentic
communication
,
"
says
cognitive
neuroscientist
ken
paller
,
who
oversees
the
laboratory
where
this
groundbreaking
communication
took
place
.
"it
can
be
done
.
"
researchers
at

at
northwestern
university
in
illinois
,
along
with

in

,
germany
and
the

independently
demonstrated
two-way

with

are

during

the
breakthrough
was
achieved
in

by
karen

s
doctoral
student
,
and
christopher
mazurek
,
a
volunteer
research
participant
at
the
time
of
the
study



and
one
of
the
first
people
to
ever
engage
in
a
real-time
dialogue
from
within
a
dream
.

this
discovery
holds
tantalizing
possibilities
for
expanding
our
understanding
of
how
our
minds
work
.
it
may
even
lead
to
methods
that
could
improve
our
ability
to
learn
difficult
skills
or
solve
complex
problems
.

and
,
with
the
help
of
a
new
smartphone
app
from
paller
'
s
lab
,
you
could
even
try
it
at
home
.

the
windows
to
the
soul
(
and
dreams
)
research
into
the
fundamental
nature
of
dreams
,
and
what
the
human
mind
can
do
while
dreaming
,
has
been
limited
by
a
seemingly
unsolvable
problem
:
you
can
'
t
get
much
information
about
someone
'
s
dream
while
they
'
re
actually
having
the
dream
.
"all
we
have
are
the
stories
people
tell
when
they
wake
up
,
"
says
paller
.
that
deficiency
has
left
an
entire
state
of
consciousness
largely
unexplored
.

the
novel
methods
pioneered
by
konkoly
,
paller
and
their
colleagues
are
designed
to
solve
this
problem
and
open
entirely
new
areas
of
research
focused
on
the
dreaming
mind
.
konkoly
describes
the
possibilities
:
"right
now
,
we
conduct
psychology
experiments
with
people
who
are
awake
.
with
two-way
communication
[during
dreams]
,
we
could
conduct
some
of
the
same
experiments
while
people
are
sleeping
.
it
could
really
expand
our
view
of
consciousness
and
what
the
mind
is
capable
of
.
"
but
,
how
can
a
dreaming
research
subject
communicate
if
they
can
'
t
even
move
,
let
alone
speak
,
while
sleeping
?
the
answer
requires
some
explanation
about
what
happens
in
our
mind
during
sleep
.

konkoly
mazurek
(

)
sleeps
in
the
lab
as
electrical
signals
from
his
brain
and
eyes
are
displayed
on
a
computer
monitor
.

scientists
have
identified
the
different
stages
of
sleep
by
monitoring
electrical
signals
from
the
brain
using
electroencephalography
,
or
eeg
,
and
from
other
places
in
the
body
.
when
the
electrical
signals
are
recorded
and
plotted
,
they
chart
the
course
our
mind
takes
as
we
progress
through
the
stages
of
sleep
.

as
you
sleep
,
your
mind
transitions
through
several
different
stages
,
from
light
sleep
to
deep
sleep
and
eventually
to
rem
sleep
.
rem
sleep
is
notable
not
just
for
what
'
s
moving



our
eyes



but
what
isn
'
t
.

although
our
mind
is
active
and
dreams
often
occur
during
rem
sleep
,
our
bodies
are
almost
completely
paralyzed
.
that
presents
an
obvious
challenge
for
communications
since
we
can
'
t
move
the
body
parts
we
typically
use
to
communicate
.
as
the
name
"rapid
eye
movement"
suggests
,
however
,
there
is
an
exception
.

during
rem
sleep
,
our
eyes
move
around
behind
our
eyelids
in
a
seemingly
random
fashion
,
which
often
corresponds
to
the
sleeper
"looking"
at
various
imagined
things
in
their
dream
.
if
you
dream
that
you
'
re
looking
at
something
,
your
closed
eyes
move
correspondingly
as
if
you
were
looking
at
something
while
awake
.

that
phenomenon
led
researchers
to
a
key
insight
:
if
eye
movement
were
consciously
controlled
,
the
dreamer
'
s
eyes
could
become
a
vehicle
for
getting
a
message
to
the
waking
world
.

or

planet
?
so-called
lucid
dreamers
can
do
these
things
and
more
from
the
comfort
of
their
own
bed
.
accomplished
lucid
dreamers
have
reported
being
able
to
regularly
achieve
awareness
in
their
dreams
and
even
"programming"
themselves
to
have
dreams
about
specific
activities
or
locations
.

christopher
mazurek
was
not
one
of
those
people
.

"i
had
no
experience
with
lucid
dreaming
,
"
says
mazurek
,
an
undergraduate
student
at
northwestern
university
and
now
research
assistant
in
paller
'
s
sleep
lab
.
at
the
time
,
he
was
a
volunteer
research
participant
.
"before
i
entered
the
lab
,
i
never
had
anything
near
a
lucid
dream
.
"
to
prepare
mazurek
and
the
other
u
.
s

volunteers
,
konkoly
wired
each
participant
with
electrodes
that
sense
brain
activity
through
the
scalp
,
behind
the
ears
,
on
the
chin
and



critically



near
the
eyes
.

those
would
allow
the
researchers
to
monitor
and
record
even
slight
eye
movements
.
"when
your
eyes
move
in
their
sockets
,
it
creates
an
electrical
current
which
is
detected
by
the
electrodes
and
recorded
,
"
says
konkoly
.

the
electrodes
on
his
face
will
detect
the
movement
of
his
eyes
as
he
sleeps
.

konkoly
also
trained
each
research
participant
to
help
them
achieve
lucidity
and
instructed
them
on
what
to
do
if
they
succeeded
.
that
included
learning
to
recognize
the
specific
sound
she
would
play
when
they
entered
rem
sleep
,
prompting
the
participants
to
realize
they
'
re
dreaming
and
thus
become
lucid
.
the
participants
also
learned
the
distinct
response
signal
they
should
produce
from
within
their
dream
:
moving
their
eyes
from
left
to
right
multiple
times
.

"repeatedly
looking
from
left
to
right
is
a
very
distinctive
eye
movement
and
it
stands
out
from
other
eye
movements
during
rem
sleep
,
"
says
konkoly
.
as
she
carefully
watched
the
eeg
and
saw
mazurek
progressing
through
the
stages
of
sleep
and
into
rem
sleep
,
she
spotted
the
repeating
left-right
signal
on
the
monitor
as
mazurek
signaled
his
awareness
.

"he
'
s
lucid

remembers
konkoly

"
konkoly
played
a
randomly
selected
audio
recording
:
"eight

"
mazurek
knew
he
would
be
presented
with
simple
math
problems
but
did
not
know
which
problems
would
be
selected
.
some
of
the
international
labs
in
the
study
used
different
methods
to
send
messages
to
their
dreaming
subjects
,
such
as
flashing
lights
in
morse
code
which
the
sleepers
could
perceive
through
their
closed
eyelids
and
manifest
in
their
dream
.
in
most
of
the
labs
,
the
research
participants
were
trained
to
move
their
"dream
eyes"
to
signal
their
answer
.

a
few
seconds
later
,
konkoly
saw
mazurek

response
written

the
peaks

:

"
konkoly
sent
another
randomly
selected
math
problem
and
once
again
received
a
correct
response
.
and
what
was
mazurek
dreaming
about
during
this
groundbreaking
exchange
between
two
worlds
?

"i
dreamed
i
was
sleeping
in
the
lab
when
i
heard
her
question
,
"
he
says
.
despite
that
rather
mundane
dreamscape
,
"it
still
blew
me
away
how
different
and
intense
and
odd
it
all
felt
.
it
was
different
than
anything
i
could
have
imagined

.

to
obtain
independent
verification
of
their
results
,
konkoly
sent
the
recorded
data
to
an
expert
"sleep

who
can
tell
you
what

a

scorer
is
trained
to
"read"
the
recorded
electrical

and
analyze
their
complex
patterns
.
the
sleep
scorer
confirmed
that
mazurek
was
indeed
in
rem
sleep
during
the
exchange
.

while
mazurek
was
the
first
in
paller
'
s
lab
to
achieve
two-way
communication
in
a
dream
,
two
more
participants
later
accomplished
that

feat
.
meanwhile
,
researchers
in
france

germany

the

were
independently
testing
methods
for
two-way

in

and
reported
that
three
additional

collective
results
from
all
the
laboratories
are

"
joking
aside
,
researchers
have
a
number
of
ideas
for
how
this
discovery
could
be
expanded
and
applied
.
"there
'

that
lucid
dreaming
is
a
great
place
to
practice
skills
compared
to
when
you
'
re
awake
,
"
says
konkoly
.
"for
example
,
you
could
slow
down
time
so
you
could
practice
a
skill
in
more
detail
or
practice
something
without
having
any
fear
of
the
repercussions
of
failing
.
"
imagine
a
surgeon
attempting
to
perfect
a
technique
used
in
open
heart
surgery



in
a
dream
.

"there
are
many
unexplored
neurobiological
aspects
to
learning
and
training
during
rem
sleep
.
but
without
two-way
communication
,
you
can
'
t
conduct
a
proper
controlled
experiment
to
understand
it
,
"
she
adds
.

"people
say
'
sleep
on
it
,
'
when
grappling
with
a
hard
problem
,
"
says
paller
,
in
reference
to
his
research
published
in
2019
,
which
showed
people
who
were
cued
to
think
about
puzzles
during
sleep
exhibited
substantial
improvement
in
finding
solutions
.
"there
'
s
some
sense
that
sleep
can
help
you
find
an
answer
to
a
problem
that
'
s
vexing
you
.
our
two-way
communication
method
provides
hope
for
improving
that
.
if
you
'
re
working
on
a
problem
,
can
you
be
reminded
of
that
problem
during
a
dream
and
come
up
with
a

more
easily
?

"from

we

says
.

the

the

young
woman
sleeping
photo
:
aleksandarnakic/getty
images
have
you
ever
woken
up
from
a
dream
about
a
neighbor
or
a
cousin
or
the
barista
at
your
local
coffee
shop
,
confused
and
disoriented
and
wondering
what
the
hell
that
was
all
about
?
most
of
us
have
.
even
a
dream
about
someone
you



d
expect
to
dream
about
,
like
an
ex
or
a
parent
,
might
not
make
much
sense
at
first
.

if
you



re
finding
yourself
stumped
and
can



t
get
it
out
of
your
mind
,
a
dream-interpretation
practice
might
help
.
first
,
it



s
important
to
know
that
there
are
countless
traditions
,
and
variations
on
traditions
,
related
to
understanding
our
dreams
.

the
indigenous
guarani
culture
,
for
example
,
has
a
long
history
of
dream-centric
spirituality
.
according
to
amanda
takwapu
,
a
spiritual
practitioner
and
apprentice
to
the
tupi-guarani
traditions
,
specific
cosmovisions



ways
of
approaching
and
understanding
dreamwork



might
even
vary
from
tribe
to
tribe
.
what
doesn



t
change
in
guarani
practice
is
that
it



s
not
viewed
as
interpretation
,
exactly
.
the
experience
of
trying
to
understand
a
dream
is
instead
seen
as
a
conversation
between
the
dream
,
the
person
who
experienced
it
,
and
anyone
they



re
talking
to
about
it
.


this
is
something
that
we
dialogue
with
when
we



re
sleeping
and
when
we



re
awake
during
the
day
,



she
explains
.


it



s
a
territory
that



s
consciously
alive
with
us
.



for
alex
shiflett
,
a
licensed
mental-health
clinician
and
dream
doula
,
their
practice
is
influenced
by
the
psychoanalytic
methods
of
freud
and
jung
as
well
as
various
spiritual
dream-interpretation
methods
and
the
use
of
dreams
in
creative
practices
.


my
practice
is
rooted
in
the
philosophy
that
everyone
in
the
dream
is
you
;
this
is
also
related
to
the
concept
of
everything
and
everyone
being
connected
,



they
explain
.

it



s
okay
if
you



re
unsure
which
type
of
dreamwork
practice
makes
the
most
sense
for
you



try
a
few
and
see
what
resonates
.
(
just
make
sure
you



re
being
respectful
and
non-appropriative
;
in
the
case
of
guarani
dreamwork
,
takwapu
says
expanding
access
to
traditional
knowledge
is
one
of
her
goals
,
but
this
may
not
be
true
for
all
indigenous
practices
.
)
when
a
certain
method
feels
right
or
makes
sense
to
you
,
you



ll
know
.
a
good
first
step
is
to
focus
on
remembering
and
thinking
about
your
dreams
,
whether
that



s
through
a
dream
journal
or
good
old-fashioned
conversation
.
shiflett
recommends
using
a
voice-recording
app
to
describe
your
dream
as
soon
as
you
wake
up



more
on
that
below



while
takwapu
says
conversations
are
best
.

we
spoke
to
takwapu
and
shiflett
as
well
as
autumn
fourkiller
,
indigenous
mystic
and
writer
behind
the
dream
interpretation
for
dummies
newsletter
,
and
lauri
quinn
loewenberg
,
professional
dream
analyst
and
author
,
about
how
to
interpret
the
people
and
scenarios
we
envision
in
our
dreams
the
most
.
whether
it



s
an
ex
,
a
parent
,
a
co-worker
,
or
even
a
celebrity
,
keep
reading
to
find
out
why
,
for
better
or
for
worse
,
we
can



t
seem
to
get
them
out
of
our
heads
.

.

if
you
want
to
start
working
with
your
dreams



for
takwapu
,
remembering
and
discussing
dreams
is
second
nature
;
it



s
something
she
has
practiced
since
childhood
.


ever
since
you



re
able
to
start
talking
,
you



re
sharing
your
dreams
with
your
mother
or
aunties



usually
a
matriarch
of
your
village
or
of
your
clan
,



she
says
.


for
anybody
who
didn



t
have
that
privilege
growing
up
,
of
being
able
to
share
their
dreams
,
articulating
is
going
to
be
the
strongest
thing
that
you
can
do
.



while
takwapu
appreciates
dream
journals
as
a
way
of
understanding
broader
trends
in
your
dreaming
life
and
uses
one
herself
,
she
believes
that
speaking
out
loud
about
your
dreams
,
with
someone
else
there
to
hear
about
them
,
is
the
best
way
to
enter
into
a
dialogue
with
them
.


when
we



re
dreaming
,
we



re
not
vocally
dialoguing
with
anybody
,



takwapu
says
.


so
then
the
second
part
is
,
in
the
waking
life
,
embodying
it
by
feeling
it
and
articulating
it
.
this
is
going
to
strengthen
your
ability
to
bring
back
that
wisdom
into
this
material
realm
.



shiflett
agrees
that
any
attempt
to
understand
your
dream
is
best
done
in
conversation
.


because
dreams
show
us
our
blind
spots
,
it
is
best
to
do
this
practice
with
someone
who
works
with
dreams
,



they
say
.


you
might
not


see



something
until
another
person
facilitates
or
reflects
it
back
to
you
.



but
if
you
don



t
have
anyone
to
speak
to
,
another
option
shiflett
recommends
is
to
use
a
voice
recorder
as
soon
as
you
wake
up
,
allowing
you
to
stay
close
to
the
dream
.
they
advise
telling
it
as
you
remember
it
,
without
overthinking
or
self-editing
,
and
from
the
first
person
.
it



s
important
to
take
note
of
details
,
from
the
colors
you
saw
to
the
narrative
thread
the
dream
followed
.
most
important
,
says
shiflett
,
is
to
notice
what
feelings
are
coming
up
when
you
think
about
the
dream
or
particular
images
in
it



what
associations
are
you
making
,
and
how
does
it
feel
in
your
body
?

in
guarani
tradition
,
how
a
dream
makes
you
feel
matters
more
than
anything
else
.


for
us
,
it



s
less
about
identifying
objects
,
places
,
things
in
our
dreams
,
but
it



s
very
important
for
us
to
remember
how
we
feel
,



takwapu
says
.


that



s
going
to
be
an
indicator
either
to
the
elders
or
to
our
family
members
of
what
that
dream
could
signify
.



but
what
if
you
can



t
remember
your
dreams
at
all
?
according
to
shiflett
,
there
are
methods
you
can
try
that
will
help
to
jog
your
memory
.


if
you
struggle
remembering
your
dreams
,
tell
yourself
every
night
before
bed
that
you
will
remember
your
dreams
,



they
suggest
.


keep
practicing
writing
down
even
your
first
thought
upon
waking
.
remembering
your
dreams
is
like
remembering
where
you
put
your
keys



not
remembering
something
from
the
past
but
where
you
put
something
.



.

if
you
want
to
know
why
you
dreamed
about
someone
specific





when
you
dream
about
someone
,
you
are
having
subjective
and
objective
experiences
of
this
person
,



says
shiflett
.


sometimes
we
dream
about
someone
but
they



re
nothing
like
how
they
are
in
waking
life
.
so
there



s
a
part
of
yourself
that
you



ve
projected
onto
an
image
of
this
person
;
this
person
is
the
chosen
image
because
of
personal
associations
with
the
person
.



for
them
,
interpreting
the
dream
starts
with
considering
your
own
associations



memories
,
feelings
,
thoughts



with
that
particular
person
.
from
there
,
you
can
figure
out
the
story
that



s
being
told
:


dream
interpretation
is
a
practice
in
tuning
in
with
what
we
know
.



since
,
in
shiflett



s
practice
,
everyone
in
the
dream
is
you
,
you
can
try
putting
yourself
back
in
the
dream
as
the
person
you
dreamed
about
.


if
you
dream
of
someone
,
it
means
you



re
noticing
them
,
or
something
about
them
,
within
yourself
.



shiflett
also
says
it



s
important
to
consider
larger
patterns
and
the
role
the
person
plays
in
your
life
and
in
your
dreams
more
broadly
.

for
takwapu
,
it



s
just
another
example
of
how
important
it
is
to
connect
with
how
you
felt
during
the
dream
.


did
you
feel
safe
with
this
person
?
did
you
feel
hesitancy
around
this
person
in
the
dream
?

was
this
person
coming
toward
you
?
were
they
going
away
from
you
?



she
asks
.
all
of
these
emotional
elements
are
helpful
signals
in
understanding
the
dream



s
message
.

.

if
you



re
curious
about
the
connections
between
dreaming
and
spirituality



for
some
dream
analysts
,
working
with
dreams
is
simply
a
psychological
practice
based
entirely
on
the
dreamer



s
inner
workings
and
psyche
.
but
in
many
traditions
,
dreamwork
is
a
spiritual
practice
.
for
shiflett
,
it



s
a
bit
of
both
;
they
believe
that
every
aspect
of
a
dream
comes
from
the
self
,
but
they
also
believe
that
a
person



s
internal
world
contains
a
channel
to
the
divine
.


we
just
have
to
create
practices
and
rituals
to
tune
in
to
the
frequency
,



they
say
.


dreams
can
be
part
of
that
practice
and
ritual
.



takwapu
says
that
for
the
guarani
,
there
is
no
real
separation
between
our
dreams
and
the
spiritual
realm
.
that
can
be
understood
even
from
the
guarani
word
for
dream
,
aetxara



u
.
the
prefix
,
aetxa
,
means


to
see
beyond
this
material
realm/plane
.



dreams
aren



t
just
a
channel
to
the
spiritual
;
they
themselves
take
place
in
a
spiritual
realm
.
she
uses
the
metaphor
that
,
for
her
,
the
spirit
realm
exists
in
the
same
way
the
city
of
london
does
:
she



s
not
there
right
now
,
but
she
knows
it
exists
and
is
full
of
movement
and
life
.


the
spirits
,
the
energies
and
the
entities
that
some
folks
outside
of
an
indigenous
culture
might
see
as
a
separate
realm



for
us
,
we
view
it
and
we
dialogue
with
it
,



she
says
.


and
we
have
a
relation
to
it
in
our
waking
world
and
the
dream
space
and
our
afterlife
.
so
it



s
something
that



s
continually
existing
,
and
it



s
not
a
separate
realm
.



.

if
you



re
dreaming
about
someone
repeatedly



a
one-off
dream
about
another
person
is
one
thing
.
but
when
it
becomes
a
repeated
pattern
,
that
can
be
especially
significant
.
to
work
with
repeating
dreams
about
someone
specific
,
takwapu
recommends
first
thinking
about
how
the
person
you



re
dreaming
about
is
related
to
you
in
waking
life



your
current
interactions
with
them
or
even
the
lack
thereof
.


if
they



re
repeatedly
coming
to
you
in
dreams
,
that



s
definitely
significant
subconsciously
or
spiritually
,



she
says
.
then
,
when
discussing
how
that
person
is
represented
in
your
dreams
and
in
your
waking
life
,
consider
how
it
feels
just
to
talk
about
it
without
them
present
.
if
you
feel
the
need
to
include
them
in
the
conversation
or
talk
to
them
about
what



s
happening
in
your
dreams
,
takwapu
says
that



s
an
indicator
of
spiritual
significance
.


there
might
be
a
dialogue
that
you
guys
are
meant
to
have
,
and
maybe
this
dream
is
going
to
be
opening
up
that
conversation
for
you
,



she
says
.


it



s
definitely
something
to
discuss
with
a
trusted
person
that
guides
you
in
your
dreams
,
or
also
reach
out
to
that
person
if
it



s
safe
to
do
so
.



shiflett
says
that
our
dreams
often
involve
repeated
themes
and
coincidences
for
us
to
uncover
.








there
are
synchronicities
when
dreaming
of
others
that
we
might
not
know
the
whole
meaning
of
until
hindsight
,



they
explain
.


notice
how
often
you
might
dream
of
a
certain
person
.
does
this
person
in
your
dream
always
play
the
same
role
?
do
they
come
up
after
certain
events
in
waking
life
?
what
is
the
larger
pattern
?



.

if
you
dream
about
a
stranger



some
of
the
most
confusing
dreams
are
the
ones
in
which
the
subject
is
a
person
we
don



t
recognize
from
our
waking
life
.
takwapu
cautions
against
automatically
thinking
of
them
as
a


stranger
.





this
could
be
a
premonition
,
a
spirit
,
an
embodiment
that



s
waiting
for
you
,



she
says
.


and
we



re
already
identifying
it
as
a
stranger
.
our
words
hold
power
;
imagine
this
energy
trying
to
come
through
to
us
,
and
we



re
like
,
this
is
a
stranger
.
it



s
really
important



if
you
aren



t
familiar
with
the
people
that
you



re
dreaming
about



to
not
immediately
classify
it
as
a
stranger
.



shiflett
says
that
in
their
practice
,
dreams
about
unfamiliar
people
can
be
related
to
the
jungian
archetypes
found
in
dreams
:
the
self
,
the
shadow
,
the
anima/animus
,
and
the
persona
.


explore
what
this
character
was
doing
,
their
role
in
the
dream
,
and
potentially
other
associations
with
the
person
,



they
suggest
.

.

if
you
have
a
nightmare
about
someone



so
does
the
tone
of
the
dream
matter
as
much
as
who
was
in
it
?
takwapu
says
it
does
,
but
she
also
explains
that
in
the
guarani
cosmovision
,
there



s
no
such
thing
as
a
nightmare



the
label
itself
is
a
box
in
which
we
tend
to
toss
any
unpleasant
feelings
that
might



ve
come
up
during
a
dream
without
closely
inspecting
them
.
instead
of
doing
that
,
she
recommends
getting
curious
about
the
feelings
that
came
up



did
you
feel
unsafe
?
did
you
feel
a
loss
of
control
?
did
you
feel
shame
or
embarrassment
?
you
can
then
investigate
further
into
why
that
feeling
makes
you
scared
or
uncomfortable
:


when
we
start
dismantling
this
idea
that
some
dreams
are
good
dreams
or
nightmares
,
that



s
where
shadow
work
comes
in
.



the
feelings
a
dream
brought
up
can
still
be
spiritually
significant
.

here
,
takwapu
references
the
guarani
word
djapytsaká
,
which
she
describes
as
a
sense
of
spiritual
caution
or
discernment
.
consistently
practicing
that
discernment
,
and
deepening
your
awareness
of
the
dream
realm
,
can
help
you
develop
a
stronger
sense
of
when
a
dream
has
a
message
to
share
.


it
could
signify
that
you
should
reach
out
to
them
,
or
maybe
it



s
reminding
you
to
share
that
dream
with
them
,



she
says
.



a
lot
of
the
time
,
we
believe
when
we
share
our
dreams
with
other
people
,
it
has
more
to
do
with
the
person
we



re
choosing
to
share
it
with
.
there
might
be
a
message
for
them
that
they
need
to
hear
,
even
if
we
didn



t
dream
about
them
directly
.



.

if
you
dream
about
your
ex





the
most
common
ex
that
we
tend
to
dream
about
is
our
first
love
.
in
fact
,
we



ll
dream
about
that
person
even
50
years
since
we



ve
been
with
them
,



says
loewenberg
.
the
reason
why
that
particular
ex
tends
to
keep
showing
up
in
our
dreams
is
that
they
symbolize
what
first
love
feels
like



passion
,
excitement
,
always
wanting
to
be
together
,
being
desired
,
and
all
those
magical
feelings
.
so
the
first
love
will
show
up
whenever
our
current
relationship
gets
a
little
routine
and
humdrum
and
we
need
to
spice
it
up
and
bring
back
those
feelings
.
they
can
also
show
up
when
we



re
in
a
dry
spell
and
we
haven



t
been
in
a
relationship
for
a
while
.



according
to
fourkiller
,
ex
dreams
are
all
about
the
past
.


not
to
get
too
deep
in
the
weeds
here
,
but
i



m
a
young
millennial
with
young
millennial
friends
,
and
that
means
i
have
been
asked
about
dreaming
about
an
ex
too
many
times
to
count
,



says
fourkiller
.


my
rule
of
thumb
is
that
it
almost
never
means
you
should
get
back
with
said
ex
,
especially
if
it
was
a
horrible
terrible
relationship
that
i
was
always
very
happy
to
commiserate
about
the
first
time
around
but
that
,
if
you
ignore
my
dream
advice
,
i
will
probably
not
be
as
happy
to
again
.
ex
dreams
are
simply
about
the
past
,
about
what
we



ve
left
there
.
about
the
parts
(
not
persons
)
that
may
be
salvageable
from
it
.
about
showing
grace
to
ourselves
.



takwapu
says
that
the
relationship
you
currently
have
with
your
ex
is
a
relevant
factor
.


maybe
it



s
somebody
that
is
no
contact
,
but
they



re
still
finding
you
in
the
dream
realm
,
and
that



s
a
whole
different
spiritual
conversation
to
have
,



she
says
.


it
has
to
do
with
your
protection
,
your
safety
,
in
both
the
dream
realm
and
the
waking
world
.



if
you
can



t
or
don



t
want
to
speak
to
the
ex
you



re
dreaming
about
,
that
in
itself
can
be
an
indicator
of
what
the
dream
signifies
.
if
you
could
see
yourself
talking
to
your
ex
about
the
dream
,
maybe
that
means
there
is
a
conversation
you
need
to
have
with
them
.
but
if
you
can



t
,
it
could
just
mean
they



re
the
one
trying
to
connect
with
you
.


there
could
be
some
things
that
have
been
unprocessed
.
there
could
be
emotional
things
or
even
spiritual
ties
that
are
asking
to
be
let
go
of
,



she
says
.

.

if
you
dream
about
your
mother





ah
,
the
mother
.
part
of
the
triplicate
of
the
maiden
,
mother
,
and
crone
.
when
it
comes
to
dreams
with
archetypes
,
sometimes
the
most
obvious
answer
is
the
most
true
,



says
fourkiller
.


they
follow
occam



s
razor
in
that
respect
.
so
when
dreaming
of
a
mother
(
or
your
mother
)
we
must
think
about
the
traditional
elements
associated
with
motherhood
,
like
nurturing
,
and
ask
ourselves
if
we
are
neglecting
to
nurture
ourselves
,
a
relationship
,
a
dream
,
etc
.
if
dreaming
about
your
mother
specifically
,
that
could
mean
that
it
is
time
to
interrogate
that
relationship
,
what
it
has
left
you
with
,
and
what
it
is
doing
to
you
now
.
sorry
.



according
to
loewenberg
,
dreams
about
mothers
are
more
common
than
those
about
fathers
.


we
tend
to
dream
about
the
mother
more
than
the
father
figure
.
in
fact
,
on
average
,
we
tend
to
dream
of
our
mothers
or
a
mother
figure
about
once
a
week
.
it



s
important
to
remember
,
though
,
especially
when
you



re
figuring
out
what
the
different
people
in
your
dream
mean
,
that
all
figures
actually
represent
a
part
of
yourself
.
the
dreaming
mind
will
show
us
the
different
bits
of
our
personality
in
the
form
of
a
person
.
so
,
that
being
said
,
if
you



re
a
mother
and
you
dream
about
your
mother
or
a
mother
figure
,
that



s
going
to
represent
your
role
as
mom
.
pay
attention
to
how
she
is
in
the
dream
.
is
she
helpful
?

is
she
ill
?
is
she
dying
?
is
she
in
trouble
?
however
she
is
portrayed
in
the
dream
is
a
reflection
of
how
you
are
seeing
yourself
as
a
mom
.



loewenberg
adds
:


if
you



re
not
a
mother
,
then
go
ahead
and
look
at
your
current
relationship
with
your
mom
.
if
there



s
no
issue
there
,
then
she
will
represent
the
part
of
you
that
is
nurturing
,
takes
care
of
yourself
,
and
is
nurturing
to
others
around
you
.

if
you
dream
about
your
co-workers





if
it



s
a
co-worker
you
deal
with
on
a
daily
basis



someone
you
work
closely
with



then
they
probably
will
be
playing
themselves
,



says
loewenberg
.


and
so
whatever
is
going
on
in
the
dream
will
reflect
whatever
is
going
on
between
you
and
the
co-worker
in
real
life
.



but
how
about
a
co-worker
you
don



t
interact
with
often
?
loewenberg
says
the
following
:


they



re
going
to
represent
some
part
of
yourself
.

so
ask
yourself



and
this
is
a
rule
that
you
want
to
apply
with
every
person
that
shows
up
in
your
dream



what
stands
out
to
you
about
this
co-worker
?
what
is
their
outstanding
quality
?
what
is
the
first
thing
you
think
of
when
you
think
about
this
co-worker
?
maybe
the
co-worker
you



re
dreaming
about
is
a
tech
expert
and
is
really
good
at
fixing
computers
if
something
goes
wrong
.
apply
that
quality
to
yourself
.
do
you
need
to
take
on
that
quality
just
for
your
job
or
in
general
?
do
you
feel
that
you
need
to
be
more
of
a
get-it-done-and-fix-it
kind
of
person
?



while
fourkiller
agrees
that
the
dream
about
your
co-worker


could
definitely
be
a
reflection
of
what
is
happening



in
your
real
waking
life
,
she
adds
that


work
dreams
always
signify
to
me
a
rootedness
there
,
in
the
realm
of
work
.
i
totally
understand
this
.
capitalism
is
rough
.
i
think
these
kind
of
dreams
can
present
a
message
that
,


hey
,
there
is
work
that
needs
to
be
done
elsewhere
.



usually
you



ll
be
able
to
tell
.
if
the
co-worker
is
berating
you
,
it
is
time
to
take
a
step
back
.
if
you
and
the
co-worker
are
in
happy
collaboration
,
despite
not
having
worked
together
before
,
it
is
probably
a
good
sign
and
there
is
excavating
to
be
done
.



.

if
you
dream
about
a
significant
other





pay
really
close
attention
to
their
behavior
and
their
condition
in
the
dream
,



instructs
loewenberg
.
for
example
,
a
really
common
dream
we



ll
have
surrounding
our
significant
other
is
that
we
can



t
find
them



that
can
indicate
one
of
two
things
.
it
could
mean
that
you
miss
them
and
that
you



re
not
spending
enough
time
with
them
,
because
maybe
they



re
always
working
or
maybe
it



s
a
long-distance
relationship
.
the
other
thing
it
can
mean
is
that
you



re
looking
for
a
way
to
better
connect



remember
that
couples
can
live
together
yet
have
no
connection
anymore
.



fourkiller
also
urges
you
to
home
in
on
the
details
of
your
dream
.


it
depends
on
the
dream
,
the
emotions
behind
it
,
but
a
significant
other
dream
can
be
a
happy
thing
,
an


i



m
so
in
love
with
the
person



thing
,
or
a
message
that
says
you
need
to
pay
less
attention
to
this
person
and
more
attention
to
what
is
going
on
in
your
own
life
and
heart
.





it



s
very
important
to
think
about
how
you
felt
in
the
dream
,
how
you
felt
about
your
interaction
with
them
in
the
dream
,
and
how
you
feel
in
your
waking
life
about
them
,



says
takwapu
.


when
you



re
able
to
identify
how
you
feel
in
this
dream
,
it



s
going
to
be
able
to
give
you
a
way
to
navigate
the
relationship
.



.

if
you
dream
about
your
significant
other
cheating





first
,
has
there
been
infidelity
in
this
relationship
?
if
yes
,
that
just
shows
that
there



s
still
distrust
,



says
loewenberg
.


but
if
this
dream
seems
to
be
coming
out
of
left
field
and
you
have
no
reason
at
all
to
suspect
them
,
the
dream
doesn



t
mean
that
they
are
cheating
.
it
can
mean
that
you
feel
that
there
is
a
third
wheel
in
the
relationship
,
like
work
or
golf
or
a
new
baby



something
that
is
causing
you
to
feel
cheated
out
of
your
time
and
attention
with
the
significant
other
.



fourkiller
also
points
to
previous
cheating
as
an
important
factor
.



don



t
jump
to
conclusions
!
just
like
a
death
dream
,
this
doesn



t
mean
that
they
are
cheating
.
unless
they
have
before
.
then
they
might
be
,



she
says
.


if
they
haven



t
,
though
,
think
about
the
material
reality
of
the
relationship
.
have
you
been
spending
enough
time
together
?
what
is
lacking
here
?
am
i
being
supported
?
am
i
supporting
?
all
that
.



.

if
you
dream
about
your
significant
other
dying





don



t
look
at
that
literally
!
dreams
are
symbolic
,



loewenberg
reassures
.
if
you
look
at
it
literally
,
you



re
going
to
freak
yourself
out
.
in
a
dream
,
death
represents
something
ending
or
changing
.
so
,
is
there
some
kind
of
big
change
going
on
in
your
relationship
?
are
you
reaching
a
new
level
?
did
you
suddenly
get
engaged
?
or
is
your
significant
other
changing
in
some
way
?
have
they
lost
a
lot
of
weight
?

did
they
get
a
promotion
,
and
now
there



s
not
enough
time
with
each
other
and
that
relationship
is
changing
in
that
respect
?
assess
things
with
that
kind
of
approach
.



fourkiller
agrees
that
a
shift
is
on
the
horizon
.


this
relationship
is
about
to
evolve
,
big
time
.
it
does
not
mean
that
they
are
about
to
keel
over
.

if
you
dream
about
someone
who
has
already
died



for
this
one
,
fourkiller
says
the
interpretation
depends
on
your
personal
beliefs
.


i
am
someone
who
believes
the
dead
can
visit
us
,
that
they
can
give
us
messages
or
just
drop
by
.
if
you



re
not
,
though
,
think
about
what
messages
(
though
perhaps
not
literal
)
your
brain
is
trying
to
bring
you
by
presenting
this
person
to
you
.
is
it
a
message
of
grief
?
of
love
?
of
warning
?





if
you
dream
of
someone
who
has
died
,
they
will
likely
represent
a
personality
trait
that
you
both
share
,



loewenberg
adds
.


or
they
can
represent
who
you
were
when
they
were
alive
and
in
your
life
.
for
example
,
if
you
have
a
childhood
friend
who
has
passed
away
and
you
dream
of
them
,
they
could
represent
who
you
were
back
when
you
were
friends
and
they
were
alive
.



.

if
you
dream
about
someone
famous





celebrities
are
really
fun
to
dream
about
!
one
of
the
most
common
dreams
of
a
celebrity
is
that
you



re
friends
with
them
and
you



re
hanging
out
with
them
,



says
loewenberg
.


it
can
be
a
celebrity
you
really
like
or
it
can
be
someone
who
seems
random



regardless
,
the
celebrity
is
going
to
represent
some
part
of
yourself
that
,
like
a
celebrity
,
you
feel
deserves
recognition
and
perhaps
even
applause
.
ask
yourself
what
the
celebrity
is
best
known
for
.
is
it
a
song
?
look
at
the
title
or
the
lyrics
of
that
song
because
chances
are
there
will
be
something
relevant
to
your
life
in
either
the
title
or
lyrics
.
if
the
celebrity
is
an
actor
,
are
they
best
known
for
a
tv
show
or
a
movie
?

then
ask
yourself
if
something
is
relevant
to
you
in
the
title
of
that
show
or
movie
,
in
the
story
line
,
or
,
perhaps
,
in
the
character
they
play



maybe
you
relate
to
that
.



unless
you
recently
watched
something
with
that
particular
celebrity
,
fourkiller
says
this
dream
may
actually
be
about
your
own
desire
for
recognition
.


did
you
watch
a
movie
with
them
in
it
?
if
not
,
let



s
talk
about
recognition
and
celebration
.
there
is
a
part
of
you
that
deserves
to
be
recognized
and
celebrated
,
and
it



s
probably
not
being
recognized
or
celebrated
,



she
says
.


can
you
identify
that
part
?
can
you
see
it
?



.

on
the
celebs
who
appear
in
dreams
most
often
:


i
remember
there
was
a
time
when
oprah
was
the
most
dreamt
of
celebrity



but
i
would
say
that
,
overall
,
in
all
the
years
i



ve
been
doing
this
,
it
would
probably
be
the
president
at
the
time
that
i
get
asked
about
the
most

loewenberg

fourkiller

are
much
less
likely
to
submit
a
dream
for
interpretation
that
has
to
do
with
celebrities
,
though
perhaps
that



s
because
they
think
it
is
less
worthy
of
interpretation
.



the
takeaway
:
fourkiller
notes
that
even
the
silly
dream
you
deem
unworthy
of
interpretation
still
has
significance
.


not
every
dream
necessarily
has
a
meaning
,
but
all
dreams
are
important
.
even
if
they



re
silly
.
even
if
they



re
scary
.
and
so
on
,



she
says
.


knowing
whether
a
dream
is
worth
interpreting
is
up
to
the
dreamer
themself
,
and
it
is
something
that
only
comes
with
time
.
i
cannot
decide
for
you
what
is
important
,
i
can
only
guide
you
into
(
hopefully
)
a
deeper
self-knowledge
,
one
that
you
will
use
to
add
weight
and
importance
to
your
own
experience
,
which
will
in
turn
let
you
value
your
mind
,
your
thoughts
,
and
yes
,
always
,
your
dreams
.



in
general
,
fourkiller
says
dream
interpretation
can
be
an
incredibly
subjective
practice
.


my
interpretations
are
rooted
in
both
a
personal
spiritual
practice
,
and
,
if
we



re
getting
technical
,
probably
a
jungian-inspired
one
,
too
.
so
with
that
in
mind
,
your
interpretation
might
be
different
than
one
i
might
come
up
with
,
but
that
doesn



t
make
it
less
true
,



she
says
.


my
rule
of
thumb
here
is
to
not
disregard
obvious
conclusions
,
but
to
never
settle
on
a
final
interpretation
until
everything
has
been
sorted
through
.
make
sure
to
pay
attention
to
themes
,
emotions
,
archetypes
,
etc
.
this
will
help
you
dig
deeper
,
reflect
,
and
not
lean
on
surface-level
analysis
.

i
don
'
t
believe
that
dreams
have
any
special
meaning
,
or
anything
.

nevertheless
,
i
find
dreams
interesting
.
i
always
try
to
remember
what
i
dreamt
about
right
after
i
wake
up
,
and
i
even
remember
many
dreams
i
had
when
i
was
still
a
child
.

so
,
i
'
ve
noticed
that
my
dreams
kinda
have
a
recurrent
theme
.
even
though
they
are
quite
messy
and
they
never
seem
to
really
have
a
plot
,
i
almost
always
seem
to
be
anxious
about
something
in
them
.
i
'
m
either
late
for
class
,
or
i
forgot
to
feed
my
cat
,
or
i
can
'
t
find
something
i
really
need
.
.
.
there
'
s
always
something
wrong
or
amiss
,
and
it
'
s
usually
my
fault
.
lol
.
last
night
i
dreamt
that
there
were
many
kitties
running
around
inside
a
house
(
or
some
place
.
.
.
i
'
m
not
sure
if
it
was
a
house
)
,
and
i
had
to
pick
them
up
and
place
them
somewhere
,
but
whenever
i
tried
to
hold
one
,
it
would
scape
and
run
away
.
my
dream
self
doesn
'
t
show
any
emotions
,
but
i
know
the
whole
situation
was
making
me
feel
distressed
.
gosh
,
i
have
such
random
dreams
.
-_-
anyway
,
i
really
like
to
hear
about
people
'
s
dreams
.
so
,
do
you
have
a
recurrent
dream
?
what
are
your
dreams
like
?

sometimes
,
i
have
this
dream
where
there
'
s
this
giant
black
ball
in
front
of
me
and
i
just
go
to
pick
off
the
tiniest
piece
i
can
;
and
for
some
reason
,
it
makes
me
feel
sick
once
i
'
m
conscious
.

other
than
that
,
i
can
'
t
really
remember
any
dreams
i
have
.
however
,
i
can
sometimes
remember
my
daydreams
and
fantasies
i
have
whilst
i
'
m
awake
[usually
at
the
expense
of
my
school
work
!

my
recurring
dreams
are
usually
negative
because
we
have
something
that
worries
us
and
we
became
fixated
and
consumed
by
what
where
afraid
of
.

for
example
i
had
a
recurring
dream
that
someone
was
chaseing
me
with
a
neddle
because
im
terrified
by
needles
and
had
to
do
blood
work
that
following
week
.

most
of
my
dreams
take
place
in
an
academic
setting
;
it
gets
pretty
interesting
when
primary
schools
and
uni
are
magically
combined
to
form
one
infinitely
complex
building
.
i
always
seem
to
be
running
around
and
late
for
something
,
though
i
never
quite
know
what
.

i
also
often
dream
about
things
i
'
ve
seen/experienced
lately
.
about
a
month
ago
,
my
unconscious
mind
tried
to
merge
the
voice
and
mean
girls
,
so
i
was
walking
across
campus
with
janis
,
damian
,
and
adam
levine
.
the
really
weird
part
was
i
was
lindsay
lohan
.

most
of
my
dreams
relate
to
things
going
on
in
my
life
,
emotions
i
'
m
feeling
,
things
i
really
want
to
have
or
to
be
true
or
think
about
frequently
.
.
.
sometimes
fears
and
anxieties
.
.
.
usually
nothing
too
spectacular
.
sometimes
the
scenarios
can
be
a
little
far-fetched
,
though
usually
still
based
in
reality
somehow
.

there
have
been
several
recurring
dreams
i
'
ve
had
in
my
lifetime
.
as
a
kid
,
i
used
to
dream
about
being
alone
in
my
parents
'
car
,
behind
the
steering
wheel
,
with
the
car
rolling
down
the
hill
on
the
road
we
lived
on
,
headed
straight
for
our
mailbox
.
i
always
knew
i
was
going
to
crash
,
but
there
was
nothing
i
could
do
to
stop
the
car
,
no
one
who
could
help
.
.
.
so
i
just
sat
there
,
terrified
.
the
dream
never
actually
got
to
the
point
of
the
car
crashing
,
though
;
i
always
woke
up
while
it
was
coasting
down
the
hill
.
if
i
recall
correctly
,
i
think
sometimes
(
though
not
always
)
my
dad
would
be
standing
at
the
end
of
our
driveway
,
just
watching
,
helpless
to
do
anything
.
mostly
i
had
this
dream
between
the
ages
of
about
four
and
eight
or
so
.

the
second
recurring
dream
is
one
that
started
in
my
mid-teens
and
which
i
still
have
in
various
forms
today
(
though
nowhere
near
as
frequently
as
i
used
to
have
it
)
.
at
14-15
i
developed
an
eating
disorder
(
still
with
me
today
at
nearly
28
)
,
and
during
the
worst
years
of
restricting
and
being
extremely
underweight
,
i
used
to
dream
at
least
several
times
a
week
about
completely
losing
control
with
food
.

i
'
d
somehow
have
forgotten
in
the
dream
that
i
had
an
eating
disorder
and
i
'
d
eat
normally
like
i
used
to
(
or
i
'
d
overeat
)
,
and
then
i
'
d
suddenly
remember
,
"oh
shit
!
i
'
m
not
allowed
to
do
this
anymore
!
"
lame
as
it
sounds
,
those
were
terrifying
dreams
.
i
'
d
get
hysterical
in
them
,
crying
and
screaming
and
panicking
over
what
i
'
d
done
,
how
i
'
d
ruined
everything
,
how
i
'
d
done
the
worst
possible
thing
in
the
world
that
i
could
think
of
--
something
i
no
longer
permitted
myself
to
do
in
real
life
.
many
times
i
'
d
wake
up
in
a
panic
,
and
even
though
i
'
d
soon
realise
it
had
just
been
a
dream
,
i
'
d
have
to
check
my
body
,
running
my
hands
over
the
familiar
bones
i
could
feel
,
lying
on
my
side
with
my
knees
together
and
making
sure
my
thighs
didn
'
t
touch
when
i
was
in
that
position
,
recalling
the
last
thing
i
'
d
had
to
eat
and
recounting
every
detail
of
it
in
my
mind
to
make
absolutely
sure
i
hadn
'
t
actually
eaten
something
i
wasn
'
t
"allowed"
to
.
i
still
sometimes
have
these
dreams
now
,
though
usually
they
focus
on
outright
bingeing
on
massive
amounts
of
food
(
not
just
eating
normally
)
and
then
forgetting
that
i
was
"supposed"
to
throw
it
all
up
.
.
.
lame
,
i
know
.
:
mellow
:
nah
,
it
'
s
not
lame
at
all
.
.
.
it
actually
sounds
really
anguishing
.
i
also
think
dreams
tend
to
represent
things
we
worry
too
much
about
.
.
.

no
wonder
your
eating
disorder
would
be
represented
in
your
dreams
.

i
think
my
dreams
may
represent
my
ocpd
,
somehow
.
like
,
because
of
the
way
i
always
seem
to
be
anxious
about
something
that
went
slightly
wrong
in
them
.
in
real
life
,
i
'
m
always
worried
about
miserable
details
and
obsessed
with
control
,
and
in
my
dreams
it
seems
i
lose
all
control
.

i
wish
i
could
dream
of
more
relaxing
stuff
,
like
flying
,
maybe
.
i
'
ve
never
had
a
dream
where
i
was
flying
.
lol
i
often
dream
about
going
back
to
high
school
or
college
and

.
i
always

when
i
wake
up
and
realize
it
'
s
just
a
dream
.

i
have
dreams
like
those
as
well
.
inside
the
dream
i
usually
think
"oh
,
fuck
,
why
the
hell
am
here
?
noooooo
,
it
can
'
t
be"
.

asking

me
murdering
someone
else
,
a
stranger
.
in
one
case
,
multiple
people
.

after
that
happens
,
i
feel
remorseful
in
my
dream
state
.
.
.
it
'
s
an
interesting
thing
.
usually
it
'
s
innocent
people
who
i
don
'
t
know
,
unarmed
people
.
my
sleep
schedule
keeps
me
quite
safe
from
these
terrors
,
however
.
i
go
to
bed
around
3-4am
,
and
wake
up
whenever
.
i
tend
to
dream
when
i
go
to
bed
at
10pm
or
earlier
.
if
it
'
s
not
some
horrifying
event
,
it
'
s
being
powerless
,
which
is
also
horrible
.
with
the
first
example
,
i
was
unable
to
stop
what
was
happening
.
if
i
were
in
my
right
mind
,
i
hope
i
'
ll
never
encounter
a
situation
like
that
,
and
if
i
do
,
i
hope
i
'
ll
not
do
anything
reckless
.
(
i
shouldn
'
t
,
seeing
as
i
don
'
t
have
access
to
any
firearms
.

too
common
for
my
liking
.
)
i
often
dream
about
going
back
to
high
school
or
college
and
doing
homework
i
hate
,
taking
boring
classes
,
or
taking
difficult
exams
.
i
always
feel
relieved
when
i
wake
up
and
realize
it
'
s
just
a
dream
.

being
back
in
school
is
very
common
for
me
,
too
.
over
the
last
two
years
or
so
,
it
has
shifted
noticably
,
though
-
before
that
,
it
seemed
just
"normal"
that
i
'
d
be
stuck
in
some
kind
of
infinity
loop
that
repeats
the
last
2-3
school
years
forever
;
nowadays
,
i
'
m
nearly
always
aware
that
i
did
graduate
20
years
ago
already
,
and
just
show
up
randomly
at
school
whenever
i
want
(
missing
90%
of
class
and
99%
of
homework
,
to
boot
.
.
.
and
very
aware
of
having
no
chance
in
hell
to
graduate
again
,
but
also
that
i
don
'
t
need
to
,
as
i
already
did
.
:
)
)
.

my
dream
!
classmates
still
are
just
as
i
knew
them
,
though
-
they
seem
forever
stuck
in
their
late
teens
and
apparently
going
through
12th
grade
for
the
whatever-th
time
without
noticing
.

i
never
dream
about
real
places
.
my
dreams
otherwise
follow
the
laws
of
physics
,
even
though
the
plot
may
skip
and
jump
.
very
cunning
my
dreams
,
it
'
s
hard
for
me
to
consistently
pick
holes
in
the
reality
of
them
(
tried
to
learn
to
lucid
dream
not
long
ago
)
.
the
actual
plot
can
vary
,
though
if
they
'
re
indicating
something
going
on
in
my
subconscious
i
usually
know
as
soon
as
i
wake
up
that
they
were
significant
.
significant
people
-
you
know
who
you
are
-
often
pop
up
in
them
,
often
in
strange
roles
(
don
'
t
ask

most
of
my
dreams
vary
wildly
.
but
i
do
have
a
lot
of
dreams
about
sherlock
and
merlin
.
occasionally
i
'
ll
have
dreams
that
i
'
ll
'
wake
up
'
in
and
do
stuff
before
falling
asleep
or
being
knocked
out
in
the
dream
and
then
waking
up
.
it
makes
things
really
confusing
sometimes
.
:
/
me
and
my
mum
both
have
a
'
dream
reality
'
where
everything
will
seem
the
same
in
our
dreams
but
with
subtle
differences
that
we
don
'
t
notice
until
we
wake
up
.
like
a
whole
world
in
our
heads
.
for
example
,
one
time
my
mum
dreamt
she
was
in
london
,
but
in
her
dream
reality
london
was
slightly
different
.
it
was
a
little
more
maze-like
.
streets
led
to
different
places
than
usual
and
sometimes
you
would
find
yourself
in
a
part
of
london
that
doesn
'
t
actually
exist
in
reality
at
all
but
you
feel
that
it
does
.

sometimes
,
when
i
realise
i
am
dreaming
everything
will
suddenly
fall
apart
like
it
was
an
act
the
whole
time
.
the
people
around
me
will
suddenly
get
really
angry
with
me
for
realising
that
i
am
dreaming
and
then
i
wake
up
feeling
a
little
like
i
was
just
about
to
be
attacked
by
those
dream
people
.
o_o
scary
stuff
.

i
also
get
a
lot
where
people
push
me
off
of
high
places
(
¬_¬
.
.
.
)
and
i
wake
up
feeling
like
i
am
falling

my
sleep
schedule
keeps
me
quite
safe
from
these
terrors
,
however
.
i
go
to
bed
around
3-4am
,
and
wake
up
whenever
.
i
tend
to
dream
when
i
go
to
bed
at
10pm
or
earlier
.

it
'
s
good
that
you
found
a
way
to
deal
with
it
,
but
i
guess
it
must
suck
when
you
have
to
wake
up
early
the
next
day

i
rarely
dream
at
all
but
when
i
do
,
it
'
s
often
boring
and
mundane
or
strange
.

mine
don
'
t
have
many
recurring
themes
,
but
the
themes
are
often
from
memories
.
one
about
recurring
burglary
,
as
i
was
a
victim
of
it
.
one
about
experiencing
parts
of
me
falling
off
and
rare
dreams
which
i
am
greeted
with
the
characters
i
use
to
sooth
being
overwhelmed

um

a

the
only
recurring
theme
they
have
that
i
can
think
of
is
that
they
'
re
all
extremely
strange
and
unpredictable
.
they
'

like

trips

minus

people

based
off
the
events
in
my

classmates
still
are
just
as
i

stuck

my
former
classmates
appear
in
my
school
dream
too
,
but
sometimes
i
only
know
they
'
re
my
classmates
but
don
'
t
remember
their
names
.

sometimes
classmates
from
different
stages
mix
together
in
my
dream
,
like
college
classmates
and
junior
high
classmates
sitting
in
the
same
classroom
.

usually
something
i
'
m
anxious
about--a
test
,
a
project
,
an
upcoming
meeting
.

i
have
a
lot
of
such
dreams
too

almost
guaranteed
to
happen
before
a
big
event

i
don

even

its

basically

dream
,
used

crime

it

with

subplot
i

won

i

i
barely
ever
dream
,
and
when
i
do
it
normally
means
i
'
m
due
a
bout
of
insomnia
,
so
it
'
s
not
exactly
a
happy
occasion
.
my
dreams
are
weird
anyway
-
they
make
literally
no
sense
.
three
nights
on
the
bounce
i
dreamed
i
was
a
boy
called
jason
who
had
been
accused
of
murder
,
and
despite
being
guilty
,
was
innocent
.
nope
,
i
don
'
t
follow
either
.
i
don
'
t
have
nightmares
particularly
though
,
so
i
guess
it
'
s
good
that
they
'
re
just
plain
strange
.

my
dreams
are
usually
all
over
the
place
.
the
best
ones
are
action/adventure
themed
and
the
worst
ones
are
work
anxiety
.
either
way
,
i
know
i
dream
in
color
.
i
just
wish
i
had
the
artistic
ability
to
take
some
of
the
vistas
i
'
ve
dreamt
of
to
get
them
out
of
my
head
.

funny
aside
,
so
i
went
on
zyrtec
a
couple
of
years
ago
when
my
allergies
reached
a
peak
in
the
spring
.
the
first
couple
of
nights
on
that
stuff
was
wild
.
i
never
remembered
what
i
dreamt
but
i
just
know
it
was
vivid
.
i
woke
up
feeling
pretty
good
the
next
morning
although
it
could
have
been
the
result
of
actually
being
able
to
breathe
while
sleeping
.
oxygen
to
the
brain
is
a
good
thing
!

describe
them
has
been
"lovecraftian
.
"
even
the
more
low-key
ones
have
involved
giant
,
mutated
,
wildly
colored
spiders
that
are
usually
everywhere
,
and
the
dreams
i
have
about
tornadoes
are
strange
in
the
fact
that
in
every
dream
i
have
about
them
the
horizon
always
seems
to
bend
away
from
me
.

these
dreams
always
have
a
tendency
to
create
a
bout
of
insomnia
,
because
i
chain
dream
nightmares
,
which
is
not
fun
.
it
'
s
actually
been
getting
to
the
point
i
'
ve
been
seriously
thinking
about
writing
down
the
bulk
of
what
i
can
remember
and
turning
them
into
stories
.

then
there
are
the
generally
weird
dreams
,
like
this
one
dream
i
had
where
i
was
shaving
val
kilmer
'
s
face
with
a
christmas
card
.
but
one
type
of
dream
that
i
seem
to
have
semi-annually
these
days
(
outside
of
the
nightmares
)
are
dreams
where
for
some
reason
i
'
m
chain
smoking
.

sometimes
i
'
m
drinking
instead
,
but
usually
i
'
m
smoking
.
which
is
weird
,
because
i
do
neither
,
and
i
find
these
dreams
to
be
generally
upsetting
.

one
awesome
dream
i
had
though
,
i
was
apparently
a
planetary
terrain
mapper
who
worked
from
space
using
a
jet
pack
to
get
around
and
everyone
was
wearing
indiana
jones
style
fedoras
.
i
managed
to
gain
lucidity
before
waking
up
,
too
,
which
was
pretty
awesome
.

my
sleep
schedule
keeps
me
quite
safe
from
these
terrors
,
however
.
i
go
to
bed
around
3-4am
,
and
wake
up
whenever
.
i
tend
to
dream
when
i
go
to
bed
at
10pm
or
earlier
.

it
'
s
good
that
you
found
a
way
to
deal
with
it
,
but
i
guess
it
must
suck
when
you
have
to
wake
up
early
the
next
day
.
:
mellow
:
yeah
,
it
'
s
a
little
bit
stressful
on
sundays
.

i
used
to
frequently
dream
about
another
planet
crashing
into
the
earth
.
it
would
usually
start
with
me
just
looking
at
a
sunset
or
a
comet
or
something
which
would
be
extremely
beautiful
and
then
the
dream
would
take
a
dark
turn
and
this
massive
round
object
would
appear
to
approach
the
earth
and
i
would
wake
up
when
it
'
s
about
to
hit
.
it
was
kinda
beautiful
though
because
the
massive
object
would
always
seem
to
be
approaching
calmly
and
more
like
it
was
merging
into
the
earth
rather
than
colliding
violently
.

anyway
it
'
s
weird
to
explain
to
people
why
jupiter
scares
me
.

also
i
remember
reading
coleridge
'
s
kubla
khan
for
the
first
time
and
that
night
i
dreamt
i
was
in
a
deep
green
grassland
that
stretched
as
far
as
i
could
see
and
above
me
the
sky
was
a
dark
blue
melting
into
reds
,
oranges
and
yellows
at
the
horizon
(
i
guess
my
subconscious
isn
'
t
very
creative
^_^
)
infact
now
that
i
recall
fantastically
green
,
tranquil
and
mystified
worlds
are
a
regular
theme
for
my
dreams
.
i
have
dreamt
multiple
times
that
i
am
visiting
this
place
which
is
basically
a
marble
runway
with
huge
marble
pillars
in
middle
of
a
thick
forest
.

another
time
before
going
to
this
place
i
stopped
at
the
entrance
to
have
a
quick
swim
in
the
pond/pool
.
the
water
was
black
and
there
was
no
one
there
.
i
would
rather
not
wake
up
from
these
dreams
.
.

and
flying
!
i
'
ve
flown
a
lot
in
many
dreams
and
it
'
s
awesome
!

i
had
it
at

once

sometimes
up

three

me
going

i
loved

the

i
have
never

an

that
would
fit
the
normal
bill
.
no
naked
classes
,
no

,
late

,

this

was
often
about
the
pain
i
suffered
at
being
axed

me
venting

its
door
on
an
outback
road
zakary
weyer
developed
the
skills
needed
to
build
his
very
own
jurassic
park
jeep
.
(
supplied
:
zakary
weyer
)
a
t-rex
sized
hit
jurassic
park
premiered
in
1993
and
quickly
became
the
highest-grossing
movie
of
all
time
,
dethroned
five
years
later
by
titanic
.

for
a
generation
of
dinosaur-mad
children
it
remains
a
cornerstone
of
pop
culture
,
with
six
sequels
and
numerous
books
,
tv
shows
and
video
games
released
in
the
three
decades
since
.

the
dinosaurs
are
the
stars
of
jurassic
park
,
but
vehicles
play
a
major
role
in
many
of
the
film
'
s
iconic
moments
.

there
'
s
the
scene
where
dr
alan
grant



played
by
sam
neill



and
dr
ellie
sattler



played
by
laura
dern



watch
in
awe
from
a
jeep
as
a
brachiosaurus
walks
past
,
or
when
a
tyrannosaurus
rex
breaks
free
and
attacks
the
park
'
s
tour
cars
.

mr
weyer
no
longer
uses
his
jeep
for
the
daily
commute
,
but
whenever
he
takes
to
adelaide
'
s
roads
he
can
expect
the
same
reaction
.

"every
time
i
park
somewhere
basically
i
get
people
coming
up
asking
for
photos
,
"
he
said
.

"one
guy
nearly
actually
crashed
his
bike
getting
a
gander
[as]
he
was
going
past
.
"
fandom
finds
a
way
there
is
a
global
community
dedicated
to
recreating
the
cars
from
jurassic
park
.

byron
phillips
is
from
the
australian
branch
of
the
jurassic
park
motor
pool
.

man

shirt
holds

microphone
,
one
arm
leans
on
a
car
window
where
a
model
dinosaur
pokes
its
head
out
byron
phillips
has
also
recreated
the
jurassic
park
jeep
.
(
abc
:
peter
sanders
)
"we
drive
all
around
australia
.
.
.
doing
events
and
charity
work
as
well
,
"
he
said
.

"it
'
s
all
about
making
people
smile
at
the
end
of
the
day
.
and
creating
those
memories
for
people
when
they
see
the
vehicle
and
they
have
a
photo
or
they
see
it
drive
past
.

"for
those
few
moments
,
you
'
re
really
tapping
into
the
fandom
of
whatever
that
car
is
,
and
whatever
it
belongs
to
.
"
he
loves
the
thrill
of
being
spotted
on
the
roads
,
but
there
is
a
deeper
meaning
behind
the
jurassic
park
tribute
.

"my
son
has
a
disability
so
a
big
part
of
the
reason
that
i
went
with
the
jurassic
jeep
is
because
he
can
say
'
jeep
'
and
'
dinosaur
'
,
"
he
said
.

"and
so
whenever
i
drive
around
town
,
he
knows
where
i
am
.
so
it
takes
away
the
anxiety
of
'
where
'
s
dad
?

visit

tamworth
.

(

byron
phillips
)
unlike
mr
weyer
,
mr
phillips
had
zero
mechanical
knowledge
when
he
first
started
putting
his
car
together
around
a
decade
ago
,
so
he
was
reliant
on
other
members
of
the
motor
pool
offering
their
advice
.

"there
'
s
an
online
resource
and
a
group
where
they
can
compare
notes
and
give
guidance
on
certain
parts
of
the
jeeps
,
"
he
said
.

"it
'
s
always
there
.
and
people
learn
from
each
other
.
they
learn
from
their
mistakes
.
there
'
s
been
many
mistakes
made
.
"
from
the
road
to
the
big
screen
several
cars
from
the
jurassic
park
motor
pool
made
it
to
the
big
screen
in
2024
,
when
amateur
filmmakers
in
regional
victoria
released
a
shot-for-shot
low
budget
remake
of
the
original
film
.

john
roebuck
,
who
directed
jurassic
park
:
castlemaine
redux
,
said
the
production
value
from
having
hollywood-accurate
vehicles
was
immense
.

"it
definitely
felt
like
it
was
a
level
up
in
terms
of
production
value
,
"
he
said
.

"i
think
the
cast
and
crew
were
used
to
me
turning
up
to
set
with
spray-painted
super
soakers
or
these
very
flimsily-made
velociraptor
pens
that
i
'
d
spent
weeks
building
that
fell
apart
as
soon
as
we
finished
shooting
.

"the
day
the
cars
turned
up
there
really
was
an
air
of
excitement
.

it
felt
like
a
level
up
.
"
he
even
got
to
outrun
a
t-rex
in
one
of
the
vehicles
,
in
his
on-screen
role
as
game
hunter
robert
muldoon
.

"we
had
the
actors
dressed
up
as
ellie
sattler
and
ian
malcolm
in
the
back
of
the
jeep
and
it
felt
a
little
bit
like
jurassic
park
virtual
reality
.
it
was
a
bizarre
but
exciting
feeling
,
"
he
said
.

'
not
as
hard
as
you
think
'
zakary
weyer
said
building
the
jeep
had
been
a
"life
changer"
.

it
was
also
a
lot
cheaper
than
he
expected
,
costing
around
$10
,
000
for
the
jeep
,
and
a
further
$2
,
000
on
the
jurassic

whether
it

a
jurassic

a
back

delorean
,
or
a
batmobile
,
he
has
a
simple
message
to
anyone
wanting
to
recreate
their
favourite
movie
vehicle
.

"just
do
it
.
it
'
s
actually
not
as
hard
as
you
think
once
you
get
started
,
"
he
said
.

"it
'
s
always
just
taking
that
first
small
step
like
getting
a
set
of
wheels
,
painting
them
.
that
'
s
a
pretty
simple
one
.

"and
then
from
there
,
you
'

realise
,
it
'
s
actually
not
that
bad
.

it

says
viewing
earth
from
space
underscores
its
fragility
and
global
interconnectedness
.

while
most
americans
spent
thanksgiving
day
gathered
around
a
table
with
family
and
friends
,
feet
firmly
planted
on
the
ground
,
one
maryland-raised
man
spent
the
day
journeying
to
the
stars
.

chris
williams
,
who
grew
up
in
potomac
,
has
been
an
astrophysics
researcher
at
massachusetts
institute
of
technology
and
a
clinical
physicist
at
harvard
medical
school
.
he
has
helped
build
a
low-frequency
radio
telescope
array
in
western
australia
,
studied
supernovas
at
the
u
.
s
.
naval
research
laboratory
in
d
.
c
.
and
volunteered
as
an
emergency
medical
technician
and
firefighter
.

but
williams
always
dreamed
of
going
to
space
,
floating
weightless
and
seeing
the
earth
as
a
tiny
blue
ball
.

last
month
,
the
42-year-old
father
of
two
took
off
from
kazakhstan
in
a
spacecraft
headed
for
the
international
space
station
.
he



ll
be
in
space
for
about
eight
months
.
the
crew
is
doing
stem
cell
research
and
working
with
artificial
intelligence
,
among
other
things
.

after
settling
in
at
the
iss
,
williams
talked
with
the
washington
post
this
month
about
how
the
start
of
his
time
in
space
is
going
and
how
it
feels
to
shoot
for
the
stars
and
finally
reach
them
.

this
interview
has
been
edited
and
condensed
.

q
:
what
made
you
want
to
become
an
astronaut
?

a
:
i
mean
,
i
actually
don



t
know
.
when
i
was
a
little
kid
,
i
was
always
fascinated
by
exploration
and
in
particular
,
space
.
i
think
it



s
one
of
those
things
that
a
lot
of
kids
have
fascinations
with
.
so
it
was
something
i
dreamed
about
as
a
kid
and
never
let
go
.

q
:
your
parents
told
me


star
trek



was
a
big
inspiration
for
you
.

a
:
absolutely
.
growing
up
,
we
didn



t
watch
a
lot
of
tv
,
but
that
was
one
of
the
shows
that
we
watched
sort
of
together
as
a
family
.
i
think
that
the
ethos
they
express
on


star
trek
,



of
wanting
to
explore
for
the
benefit
of
all
,
that



s
certainly
something
that



s
really
imprinted
on
me
and
something
i
firmly
believe
in
.

q
:
how
does
it
feel
physically
to
be
up
there
?
i
know
you
trained
for
it
,
but
i



m
sure
that
it



s
different
.

a
:
it



s
definitely
different
.
being
weightless
and
in
microgravity
,
it



s
a
super
interesting
experience
.
i
think
it
took
me
a
couple
days
for
my
brain
to
kind
of
get
used
to
it
.
you
work
in
three
dimensions
.

so
we
have
lockers
and
drawers
and
experiments
that
are
on
the
walls
,
but
are
also
on
the
ceilings
and
on
the
floor
.



it



s
been
an
interesting
experience
seeing
how
your
brain
adapts
to
being
in
this
weightless
environment
.
and
it
is
a
lot
of
fun
to
fly
around
and
let
go
of
things
and
have
them
float
.

q
:
will
you
get
to
do
a
spacewalk
?

a
:
we
have
some
spacewalks
on
the
schedule
coming
up
in
january
,
and
i



m
hoping
that
i



ll
be
able
to
go
out
and
be
a
part
of
that
.
i
think
that



ll
be
a
really
great
experience
.

q
:
is
there
a
tiny
part
of
you
that



s
a
little
scared
to
walk
in
space
?

a
:
when
it



s
something
you
train
so
much
for
,
you
understand
the
risks
,
but
you
also
understand
all
the
things
we



re
doing
to
mitigate
those
risks
.
when
you
have
a
deep
understanding
of
what



s
all
going
into
it
,
at
least
for
me
,
that
helps
take
a
lot
of
those
fearful
emotions
out
of
it
.

q
:
i
wanted
to
ask
how
your
experience
with
the
montgomery
county
schools
fostered
your
interest
in
space
?

a
:
i
do
not
think
i
would
be
where
i
am
today
without
the
upbringing
i
had
in
montgomery
county
,
in
particular
,
the
fabulous
public
school
system
.
i
felt
like
growing
up
i
had
so
many
opportunities
to
pursue
my
interest
in
science
.
i
went
to
blair
high
school
,
which
just
had
fantastic
opportunities
to
really
push
my
passion
for
science
and
to
give
me
the
opportunities
to
really
explore
what
it
would
look
like
to
be
a
scientist
.

i
was
also
able
to
take
advantage
of
the
fact
that
there
are
a
ton
of
wonderful
opportunities
with
federal
research
labs
.
as
a
high-schooler
,
i
was
able
to
do
astronomy
research
at
the
navy
research
lab
in
d
.
c
.

one
other
thing
that
i
think
is
pretty
special
about
montgomery
county
is
its
diversity
,
the
fact
that
you



re
surrounded
by
people
who
come
from
all
over
.
in
the
international
space
station
,
we



re
a
collaboration
of
15
different
countries
.
and
my
work
every
day
involves
interfacing
with
people
from
all
across
the
world
.
growing
up
in
montgomery
county
,
you
get
really
comfortable
with
that
,
which
is
really
,
really
wonderful
.

q
:
what
are
you
doing
in
your
downtime
up
there
?
do
you
have
downtime
?

a
:
we



re
pretty
busy
up
here
,
but
we
do
have
a
little
bit
of
downtime
.

most
of
the
time
,
i
try
to
call
my
friends
and
family
.
one
of
the
challenges
is
that
even
though
we
are
only
240
miles
above
the
surface
of
the
earth
,
we



re
still
pretty
far
away
.
and
i



m
going
to
be
up
here
for
an
eight-month
mission
.
so
staying
connected
with
my
friends
and
family
back
home
,
and
my
daughters
is
really
important
to
me
.

the
other
thing
that



s
really
nice
to
do
is
to



look
out
the
window
.

pretty
incredible
views
from
out
here
.

q
:
what
does
it
look
like
?

a
:
that



s
one
of
the
things
that
just
doesn



t
disappoint
.
you
see
these
fabulous
pictures
of
what
the
earth
looks
like
from
space
,
and
that



s
what
your
view
out
the
window
looks
like
every
day
.
you
can
see
huge
swaths
of
the
world
moving
by
,
the
view
of
city
lights
at
night
or
just
the
wonderful
natural
beauty
of
earth
.

q
:
what
does
that
do
to
your
perspective
?

a
:
i
think
the
biggest
emotion
for
me
when
i
look
out
the
window
is
this
sense
of
how
everybody
that
i
care
about
and
know
and
love
is
on
this
thing
that
i
can
see
the
whole
extent
of
and



just
how
small
and
fragile
earth
looks
.
that
really
leaves
an
impression
on
you

31
december
,
2025
with
an
ambition
to
redefine
luxury
travel
in
the
middle
east
,
saudi
arabia
is
preparing
to
launch
dream
of
the
desert
,
a
rail
experience
scheduled
to
debut
in
2026
.

initially
announced
in
2024
,
the
project
brings
together
saudi
arabia
railways
,
the
ministry
of
culture
,
and
the
saudi
tourism
authority
,
along
with
the
italian
company
arsenale
,
known
for
the
la
dolce
vita
orient
express
,
to
advance
the
kingdom
'
s
long-distance
travel
through
lavish
,
premium
,
and
culturally
driven
experiences
.

with
this
in
mind
,
arsenale
is
also
behind
several
high-profile
hospitality
projects
,
including
soho
house
roma
,
hotel
santavenere
in
maratea
,
and
a
growing
collection
of
orient
express
hotels
such
as
orient
express
la
minerva
in
rome
,
orient
express
palazzo
dona
giovannelli
in
venice
,
and
the
abbazia
di
spineto
in
tuscany
.

according
to
various
sources
,
one
of
the
project
'
s
key
aims
is
to
strengthen
saudi
arabia
'
s
position
in
luxury
transport
,
placing
it
in
competition
with
some
of
the
world
'
s
most
celebrated
luxury
trains
.

these
include
the
venice
simplon-orient-express
,
the
royal
scotsman
,
and
the
british
pullman
.

additionally
,
the
initiative
will
play
a
key
role
in
promoting
sustainable
economic
growth
.
at
the
heart
of
this
strategy
is
attracting
sustainable
foreign
investment
and
promoting
tourism
as
a
sector
capable
of
generating
long-term
returns
,
independent
of
oil
.

by
attracting
international
visitors
from
higher-spending
markets
and
increasing
levels
of
luxury
tourism
expenditure
,
the
initiative
is
expected
to
raise
national
income
and
create
multi-sector
economic
opportunities
.
this
assessment
is
supported
by
a
report
from
gcc
railway
,
a
website
specialising
in
transport
and
economic
development
.

aligning
with
vision
2030
goals
as
energy
economist
nihad
ismail
puts
it
,
the
project
is
one
of
the
strategic
pillars
of
saudi
vision
2030
,
an
ambitious
tourism
and
transport
initiative
aimed
at
diversifying
the
economy
and
reducing
dependence
on
fossil
fuels
.

nihad
also
noted
that
the
train
is
the
first
of
its
kind
in
the
middle
east
in
terms
of
luxury
and
high-end
design
,
drawing
comparisons
with
europe
'
s
famous
orient
express
.

nihad
added
that
the
project
'
s
significance
lies
in
its
close
alignment
with
the
core
objectives
of
vision
2030
,
particularly
those
focused
on
attracting
150
million
visitors
to
the
kingdom
by
the
end
of
the
decade
and
positioning
saudi
arabia
as
a
global
destination
for
tourism
and
investment
.

expanding
on
this
point
,
nihad
explained
that
dream
of
the
desert
is
not
just
a
mode
of
transport
but
a
fully
integrated
tourism
experience
,
with
its
first
journeys
expected
to
begin
in
the
final
quarter
of
2026
,
departing
from
riyadh
and
travelling
toward
jordan
'
s
southern
border
.

covering
approximately
1
,
300
kilometres
,
the
route
passes
through
areas
of
tourism
,
historical
,
and
cultural
significance
.

according
to
nihad
,
this
corridor
presents
a
valuable
opportunity
to
promote
domestic
destinations
and
connect
them
through
a
luxury
transport
network
,
further
enhancing
the
kingdom
'
s
appeal
as
a
regional
and
global
tourism
destination
.

,
ali
metwally
,
an
economist
at
a
london-based
consultancy
,
told
the
new
arab
that
dream
of
the
desert
represents
both
a
symbolic
and
strategic
step
.
he
said
it
should
not
be
viewed
as
a
form
of
mass
transportation
,
but
rather
as
a
high-end
tourism
and
entertainment
product
.

because
of
its
luxurious
positioning
and
limited
capacity
,
ali
further
explained
that
the
project
'
s
direct
impact
on
mass
transport
providers
is
likely
to
be
limited
.
instead
,
it
is
expected
to
target
high-spending
visitors
who
typically
rely
on
domestic
aviation
or
private
transport
rather
than
traditional
land-based
services
.

however
,
he
believes
the
project
could
help
reposition
the
land
transport
sector
over
the
medium
term
.
ali
said
some
operators
may
adapt
by
acting
as
feeder
services
to
railway
stations
or
by
focusing
on
more
economical
travel
segments
,
while
luxury
rail
offerings
cater
to
the
high-end
tourism
market
.

from
an
economic
perspective
,
ali
argued
that
the
project
'
s
impact
extends
beyond
simply
replacing
one
mode
of
transport
with
another
.
he
identified
three
key
areas
where
its
influence
could
be
felt
.

the
first
relates
to
maximising
the
economic
value
of
each
tourist
.

rather
than
being
confined
to
one
or
two
cities
,
travellers
will
move
along
a
long
geographic
corridor
that
includes
natural
,
historical
,
and
heritage
sites
.

according
to
ali
,
this
is
likely
to
extend
visitor
stays
and
increase
spending
on
accommodation
,
local
activities
and
services
along
the
route
,
contributing
positively
to
non-oil
tourism
income
.

the
second
area
concerns
the
project
'
s
role
in
shaping
a
new
image
of
saudi
arabia
as
a
diverse
,
high-end
tourism
destination
.

ali
said
this
positioning
moves
beyond
umrah
,
hajj
and
urban
tourism
to
include
distinctive
experiences
such
as
luxury
train
journeys
through
the
desert
,
strengthening
the
kingdom
'
s
tourism
brand
and
appealing
to
visitors
with
high
purchasing
power
.

the
third
area
concerns
the
broader
transformation
of
the
transport
sector
,
with
ali
noting
that
dream
of
the
desert
is
part
of
a
national
strategy
to
expand
the
railway
network
and
improve
the
overall
quality
of
life
.

.

dreaming

.

*
understanding
your
dreams
can
help
you
grow
and
find
peace
within
yourself
.

if
you
'
ve
ever
had
a
dream
about
someone
unexpected
,
such
as
an
ex
,
co-worker
,
or
crush
,
you
might
wonder
why
they
might
appear
in
your
dreams
.
while
dreams
are
often
centered
on
daytime
thoughts
and
concerns
,
they
can
also
reflect
unconscious
thoughts
or
feelings
about
others
.
in
other
cases
,
dreams
symbolically
represent
something
else
entirely
.

understanding
what
dreaming
about
another
person
means
can
provide
insight
into
things
you
may
be
thinking
or
worrying
about
,
potentially
without
even
realizing
it
.
read

to
start
to
decode
your
dreams
and
what
they
might
say
about
you
.

dreaming
about
someone
can
reveal
unconscious
feelings
the
psychoanalyst
sigmund
freud
played
a
significant
role
in
connecting
dream
interpretation
to
the
field
of
psychology
.
freud
suggested
that
dreams
are
one
way
to
access
the
unconscious
mind
,
which
he
described
as
a
vast
reservoir
of
thoughts
,
feelings
,
and
desires
hidden
from
conscious
awareness
.

even
though
the
contents
of
the
unconscious
are
not
directly
accessible
,
freud
still
believed
that
these
thoughts
,
memories
,
and
desires
could
still
have
an
influence
on
behavior
.
freud
also
believed
the
unconscious
could
be
explored
through
processes
such
as
dream
analysis
,
free
association
,
hypnosis
,
freudian
slips
,
and
psychoanalysis
.

freud
believed
that
bringing
unconscious
information
to
light
could
help
alleviate
psychological
distress
.
if
dreaming
about
someone
has
left
you
upset
,
distressed
,
or
just
plain
baffled
,
exploring
your
dream
'
s
meaning
may
help
you
make
sense
of
what
it
might
mean
.

breaking
down
your
dreams
of
someone
else
according
to
jesse
lyon
,
a
licensed
mental
health
counselor
and
owner
of
lyon
counseling
in
casselberry
,
florida
,
before
we
can
understand
what
it
means
to
dream
about
someone
,
it
is
essential
to
first
understand
that
dreams
communicate
information
on
two
different
levels
.

these
levels
are
known
as
the
manifest
content
and
the
latent
content
.

sigmund
freud
famously
described
these
two
aspects
of
dreams
in
his
seminal
book
"the
interpretation
of
dreams
.
"
freud
suggested
that
dreams
were
highly
symbolic
and
contained
literal
meanings
(
the
manifest
content
)
and
symbolic
meanings
(
the
latent
content
)
.

manifest
content
of
dreams
the
manifest
content
of
a
dream
refers
to
the
actual
events
and
images
that
take
place
within
the
dream
.
this
is
the
imagery
and
storyline
that
you
remember
upon
waking
.
if
you
dream
about
someone
,
the
manifest
content
would
be
the
details
about
that
individual
,
their
appearance
,
the
events
that
take
place
,
and
the
interactions
you
have
within
the
dream
.

"manifest
content
is
very
literal
and
will
communicate
with
you
directly
about
a
problem
you
have
or
situation
you
experienced
,
"
lyon
explains
.
"for
example
,
you
might
dream
about
getting
into
an
argument
with
your
romantic
partner
because
you
are
currently
experiencing
conflict
in
your
relationship
;
this
is
pretty
straightforward
dream
processing
.
"
another
example
might
be
having
a
dream
about
attending
a
concert
with
a
close
friend
you
haven



t
seen
in
a
long
time
.
the
manifest
content
would
be
the
events
,
your
friend
'
s
words
and
reactions
,
and
the
other
sensory
and
perceptual
elements
you
experience
as
a
dreamer
.

the
manifest
content
may
not
,
however
,
necessarily
reflect
the
underlying
meaning
of
the
dream
.
it
is
through
analyzing
the
latent
content


or
the
symbolic
meaning


that
you
might
get
a
better
idea
of
what
your
dream
might
mean
.

what
does
it
mean
to
dream
of
your
partner
cheating
on
you
?

latent
content
of
dreams
the
latent
content
of
a
dream
,
lyon
notes
,
is
much
more
personal
and
emotional
.
this
involves
the
subconscious
meaning
of
the
dream
,
or
what
dream
interpreters
would
say
is
the
hidden
meaning
behind
your
dream
.

in
the
previous
example
of
arguing
with
a
partner
,
lyon
explains
,
it
might
mean
that
the
person
is
struggling
with
feeling
unworthy
of
their
partner



s
love
.

dreaming
about
a
friend
you
haven
'
t
seen
in
years
might
symbolically
represent
a
subconscious
yearning
for
reconnection
or
a
desire
to
find
closure
for
unresolved
feelings
.
or
it
might
indicate
a
broader
desire
for
more
social
connection
and
companionship
in
general
.

examples
of
dream
symbolism
"if
you
ever
see
someone
show
up
in
your
dreams
,
ask
yourself
:
'
what
does
this
person
symbolize
to
me
?
'
"
lyon
suggests
.
if
it
'
s
your
:
*
boss
:
it
might
represent
struggles
with
authority
.

*
mother
:
you
might
be
dealing
with
struggles
related
to
femininity
and
self-nurturance
.

*
high-school
teacher
:
you
might
be
coping
with
feeling
judged
or
graded
.

if
you
dream
about
romance
and
relationships
what
does
it
mean
if
you
dream
about
your
crush
or
about
dating
someone
?
dreaming
about
a
crush
might
be
about
the
obvious
meaning


you
are
interested
in
being
with
them
romantically
.
however
,
lyon
notes
,
that
isn
'
t
necessarily
the
whole
story
.

because
dreams
have
manifest
(
or
literal
)
content
and
latent
(
or
more
symbolic
)
meanings
,
it
is
essential
to
consider
both
.
the
manifest
content
of
your
dreams
might
reveal
deeper
,
subconscious
meanings
that
are
worth
exploring
,
particularly
if
you
have
a
romantic
dream
about
someone
who
isn



t
necessarily
a
potential
romantic
partner
(
such
as
one
of
a
friend
or
boss
)
.

"romantic
involvement
is
all
about
connection
,
"
lyon
explains
.
"so
,
if
you
are
on
a
date
,
or
even
having
sex
with
someone
you
would
not
expect
,
that
person
symbolizes
an
area
of
your
life
that
you
need
to
connect
with
more
deeply
.
"
meaning
behind
romantic
dreams
about
someone
according
to
lyon
,
these
dreams
might
be
more
about
:
*
control
over
your
own
life
:
"if
you
dream
about
having
sex
with
your
boss
,
you
may
not
actually
want
to
have
sex
with
them
,
but
you
definitely
need
to
consider
how
you
connect
with
your
own
authority
and
assertiveness
over
your
life
'
s
direction
.
"
*
letting
go
of
emotional
baggage
:
"if
you
dream
about
having
sex
with
your
ex
,
you
may
not
actually
want
to
get
back
with
them
,
but
you
should
definitely
consider
what
unresolved
baggage
from
your
past
that
you
need
to
connect
with
and
let
go
.
"
*
personal
growth
:
"if
you
dream
about
having
sex
with
your
friend
,
think
about
what
are
the
most
important

dream
interpretation
tips
,
from
a
psychotherapist
what
dreaming
about
someone
can
tell
us
dreams
can
provide
insights
into
our
subconscious
thoughts
,
feelings
,
desires
,
and
fears
.
they
can
also
offer
a
perspective
that
can
help
deepen
your
relationships
in
ways
that
support
connection
and
mental
well-being
.

lyon
notes
it
is
important
to
remember
that
all
the
roles
we
play
in
life
act
as
characters
that
live
inside
our
minds
.
the
characters
we
play
(
such
as
parent
,
partner
,
friend
,
or
colleague
)
make
up
the
complete
picture
of
who
we
are
as
individuals
.

whenever
we
are
visited
by
someone
in
our
dreams
,
we
need
to
consider
the
literal
meaning
,
but
then
go
deeper
to
think
about
how
that
person
in
our
dreams
is
teaching
us
to
connect
with
a
new
character
that
lives
inside
us
.

counseling
"by
learning
to
understand
and
accept
all
of
the
different
characters
that
live
inside
of
us
,
we
become
more
complete
as
a
person
and
can
then
love
others
with
greater
empathy
and
understanding
,
"
lyon
says
.

dream
interpretation
is
not
one-size-fits-all
it
is
important
to
remember
that
dream
interpretation
is
highly
personal
.
the
specific
meaning
of
someone
appearing
in
a
dream
depends
on
factors
that
are
unique
to
you
.
examining
your
dreams
and
trying
to
understand
their
meanings
,
both
literal
and
symbolic
,
can
give
you
greater
insights
into
your
own
thoughts
,
emotions
,
and
relationships
.

"that
'
s
the
power
of
dreams
!
"
lyon
says
.
"to
help
us
grow
and
understand
ourselves
in
ways
that
we
could
never
do
while
awake
and
,
from
these
insights
,
find
peace
within
ourselves
and
carry
that
peace
to
others
.
"
frequently
asked
questions
*
does
dreaming
of
someone
mean
they
are
thinking
of
you
?

no
.
dreaming
about
someone
is
a
reflection
of
your
own
thoughts
and
subconscious
feelings
versus
an
indication
of
how
they
are
feeling
or
thinking
about
you
.
that
'
s
why
it
is
important
not
to
make
inferences
about
what
others
might
think
based
on
your
dreams
.

*
can
two
people
have
the
same
dream
?

while
two
people
can
certainly
dream
about
the
same
topic
or
have
similar
dreams
,
their
dreams
would
still
differ
in
various
ways
.

similarities
in
dreams
are
most
likely
due
to
factors
such
as
shared
experiences
,
connections
,
and
cultural
influences
.
for
example
,
two
friends
who
attended
the
same
event
might
have
dreams
with
similar
elements
.

common
dream
themes
do
exist
that
often
show
up
in
many
people
'
s
dreams
.
some
things
that
people
commonly
dream
about
include
being
late
,
falling
,
flying
,
school-related
activities
,
sex
,
and
being
chased
.

the
welsh
golfer
enjoyed
a
successful
debut
season
on
the
ladies
european
tour
,
claiming
three
top-10
finishes
as
well
as
a
victory
in
the
hulencourt
women
'
s
open
in
june
.

her

her
qualify
for
the
evian

and
the
aig
women
'
s
open
at
her
home
course
of
royal
porthcawl
,
her
first
taste
of
the
majors
.

harry
made
the
cut
at
porthcawl
,
finishing
tied
for
40th
place
,
a
result
she
says
capped
"a
phenomenal
week"
.

"it
was
a
dream
,
it
was
an
event
i
'
d
dreamed
of
playing
in
since
i
was
little
,
"
said
harry
.

"if
you
'

told
me
this

last

that
i
'
d
be

right
now
i
probably
wouldn

you

harry
'

early

this

saw
her

"after

the

was
to
try
to
keep
my
card
on
tour
for
the
year
and
to
have
one
top-10
finish
,
"
the
22-year-old
said
.

"seventy
people
on
the
tour
keep
their
card

that
'
s
what
i
was
going
for
-
top
70
,
then
it
became
top
20

top

the

"i

for

"it
opened
the
door
to

certainly
not

"it

another

how
far
i
can

"
harry

the

definitely

said

"if

it

"i
'

going

wisely
next

just

"i

the
dream
of
the
universal
library
monica
westin
the
internet
promised
easy
access
to
every
book
ever
written
.
why
can



t
we
have
nice
things
?

at
the
turn
of
the
millennium
,
google
books
and
similar
mass
digitization
projects
for
the
world



s
print
books
were
widely
seen
to
promise
a
universal
digital
library
for
reading
access
on
the
web
.

instead
,
the
future
we
thought
we



d
get
for
human
readers
has
arrived
only
for
machines
.



search
changes
everything
,



declared
kevin
kelly
,
the
founding
editor
of
wired
magazine
,
in
his
2006
new
york
times
magazine
cover
story
,


scan
this
book
!
,



written
a
few
years
into
the
google
books
project
.

kelly
described
a
rosy
future
in
which
future
digital
books
would
be
cross-linked
and
wired
together
to


flow
into
the
universal
library
as
you
might
add
more
words
to
a
long
story
.



kelly
bemoaned
how
congress



then
recent
extension
of
copyright
terms
to
the
life
of
the
author
plus
70
years
would
keep
much
of
the
universal
library
dark
,
at
least
temporarily
.
but
he
predicted
that
copyright
law
would
eventually


adapt
,



as
its
reign
would
be


no
match



for
the
technology
of
search
.

ultimately
,
he
thought
,


the
screen
will
prevail
.



at
that
time



one
of
techno-optimism
,
predating
the
dominance
of
social
media



this
was
the
majority
position
.

the
minority
position
was
best
expressed
a
few
years
earlier
by
michael
gorman
,
then
president-elect
of
the
american
library
association
.
in
a
2004
la
times
op-ed
,
he
described
google



s
newly
announced
project
to
mass
digitize
and
make
searchable
huge
numbers
of
books
as
an


expensive
exercise
in
futility
.



because
copyright
limitations
meant
that
much
of
what
a
reader
could
access
would
be
only
decontextualized
snippets
,
gorman
argued
,
the
project
wouldn



t
be
useful
for
the
dissemination
of
knowledge
.


the
books
in
great
libraries
are
much
more
than
the
sum
of
their
parts
,



he
wrote
.
google
books
,
he
predicted
,
would
be
a


solution
in
search
of
a
problem
.



anagh
banerjee
twenty
years
later
,
gorman



s
take
has
proved
more
prescient
than
kelly



s
.
the
vast
majority
of
google



s
digitized
books
exist
as
snippets
stuck
in
a
zombie
state
:
under
copyright
but
out
of
print
.
it
is
,
however
,
one
of
the
many
absurdities
of
our
moment
that
the
company
likely
grants
full
access
to
most
of
the
books
in
its
archive
to
at
least
one
party
:
its
own
llms
.
other
companies
have
settled
for
pirating



an
option
familiar
to
most
non-institutional
researchers
.

the
social
costs
of
keeping
so
many
of
the
world



s
digitized
books
locked
away
are
far-reaching
:
knowledge
gaps
,
weaker
scholarship
,
stalled
innovation
,
inequitable
access
,
and
market
failure
for
the
low-demand
titles
that
have
dropped
off
publisher
backlists
.

it
doesn



t
have
to
be
this
way
.
almost
all
the
infrastructure
we
now
use
to
find
,
access
,
and
read
books
in
virtual
environments



including
the
first
mass
book
digitization
projects
,
the
metadata
for
making
them
discoverable
,
and
the
authentication
processes
for
accessing
credentials
to
read
them



has
existed
for
two
decades
.
so
why
are
the
vast
majority
of
digitized
books
still
inaccessible
on
the
web
?

ask
almost
anyone
,
and
the
answer
you



ll
get
is


fair
use
.



fair
use
is
a
doctrine
that
permits
the
limited
use
of
copyright
material
.
it
is
decided
on
a
case-by-case
basis
,
and
it
has
shaped
the
major
digitized
book
lawsuits
of
our
time
.

i
argue
that
there
is
another
approach
.
instead
of
trying
to
rewrite
copyright
law
itself
,
we
could
pursue
common-sense
reforms
:
nimble
new
licensing
models
that
open
up
the
digital
stacks
.
the
us
proposed
this
approach
a
decade
ago
,
and
europe
has
since
put
one
into
practice
.
we
tried
to
build
the
universal
library
at
a
moment
of
digital
optimism
.

this
is
the
moment
to
try
again
.

making
the
stacks
virtual
the
earliest
digital
libraries
were
developed
in
the
1960s
by
universities
and
military
r&d
groups
.
these
connected
relatively
small
sets
of
archived
texts
or
abstract-only
databases
to
basic
information
retrieval
systems
.
as
computing
power
became
cheaper
and
network
bandwidth
increased
,
projects
grew
in
scope
and
complexity
.
in
1971
,
michael
s
.
hart
,
a
student
at
the
university
of
illinois
,
digitized
the
text
of
the
american
declaration
of
independence
and
shared
it
with
everyone
on
campus
via
local
arpanet
,
one
of
the
earliest
computer
networks
.
the
resulting
project
became
project
gutenberg
,
a
web-based
library
of
public
domain
books
that



s
often
described
as
the
first
true
online
digital
library
.

by
the
mid-1990s
,
digital
library
projects
linking
basic
library
holdings
information
were
starting
to
be
developed
across
europe
and
the
united
states
.
among
the
best
known
was
the
european
library
,
a
web
portal
launched
in
1997
that
hyperlinked
the
collections
of
several
european
national
libraries
.
university
libraries
were
also
starting
to
create
their
own
institutional
repositories
,
often
using
homegrown
software
.
these
smaller
digital
libraries
soon
began
to
be
quilted
together
through
both
aggregator
sites
and
protocols
for
sharing
data
.

the
dream
of
the
universal
digital
library
,
which
could
contain
all
online
content
and
link
it
together
,
began
to
take
form
.
but
it
still
contained
only
a
relatively
tiny
amount
of
full-text
content
.

google
,
in
fact
,
grew
out
of
one
such
project
.
larry
page
and
sergey
brin
began
developing
what
would
become
google
search
while
they
were
phd
students
working
on
the
stanford
integrated
digital
library
project
.
the
self-stated
ambition
of
sidlp
was
to
be
the


glue



connecting
all
digital
content
on
the
web
into
a
comprehensive
,
functional
collection
.

by
2004
,
it
seemed
like
all
the
components
of
a
digital
universal
library
were
falling
into
place
.
new
generation
web
search
and
indexing
created
the
ability
to
find
content
via
browsers
.
worldcat
,
the
world



s
largest
catalog
for
library
collections
worldwide
,
had
just
opened
its
records
.
web
crawlers
now
had
a
list
of
book
titles
,
publication
dates
,
and
other
key
data
.
the
rest
of
the
backbone
was
solidifying
.
optical
character
recognition
(
ocr
)
could
turn
scanned
images
into
searchable
text
,
while
ascii
and
html
provided
standardized
formats
that
made
text
accessible
in
any
browser
and
easy
for
search
engines
to
index
.

digitized
books
could
finally
be
integrated
into
the
wider
web
of
knowledge
.

the
most
important
component
,
though
,
was
the
books
themselves
.
fresh
off
its
ipo
,
google
announced
at
the
2004
frankfurt
book
fair
their
plans
to
index
every
book
ever
published
,
a
project
then
called
google
print
.
google
invested
massively
in
the
project
,
which
partnered
with
major
research
libraries
at
universities
including
harvard
,
the
university
of
michigan
,
and
oxford
.
in
exchange
,
library
partners
would
typically
get
their
own
digitized
copy
of
scanned
volumes
to
preserve
and
use
where
law
allows
,
such
as
providing
full
open
access
for
public-domain
items
.
most
of
google



s
library
partners
added
their
digitized
copy
to
hathitrust
,
a
digital
library
founded
in
2008
by
a
consortium
of
research
libraries
that
aggregates
,
preserves
,
and
serves
partner
scans
.

other
groups
were
also
uploading
scanned
books
to
the
web
,
but
the
only
other
organization
working
at
the
same
scale
was
the
internet
archive
.

the
internet
archive
had
begun
scanning
books
in
2004
and
stepped
up
its
pace
in
2005
.
this
included
some
scanning
done
as
part
of
a
consortial
project
called
the
open
content
alliance
,
a
partnership
across
the
internet
archive
,
many
university
libraries
,
and
,
for
a
short
time
,
microsoft
,
that
sought
to
counter
google



s
efforts
.
when
the
open
content
alliance
petered
out
,
the
internet
archive
kept
up
ambitious
levels
of
book
scanning
on
its
own
.

these
projects
captured
the
public
imagination
,
but
the
legal
problems
were
obvious
early
on
.
while
technoutopians
like
kelly
viewed
copyright
law
as
a
temporary
obstacle
,
librarians
,
archivists
,
and
especially
attorneys
recognized
its
likely
intractability
.
us
copyright
law
states
that
only
the
copyright
holder
can
make
and
distribute
copies
of
a
work
,
with
very
limited
fair
use
exceptions
,
such
as
excerpting
quotes
.

in
most
circumstances
,
anyone
making
massive
numbers
of
copies
of
books
wouldn



t
fall
under
fair
use
exceptions
.

both
google



s
and
the
internet
archive



s
projects
tested
fair
use
in
two
major
lawsuits
.
the
entire
online
landscape
bears
their
imprint
today
.

from
the
beginning
,
google



s
model
had
been
to
form
independent
agreements
with
library
scanning
partners
and
let
the
rights
holders
find
out
afterward
.
it
likely
would
have
come
as
no
surprise
to
google
when
the
authors
guild
,
the
country



s
largest
professional
organization
for
writers
,
filed
a
class
action
lawsuit
for
copyright
infringement
soon
after
the
inception
of
the
project
.
in
2008
,
google
and
the
authors


guild
proposed
a
settlement
:
google
would
pay


$125


million
and
set
up
a
book
rights
registry
,
where
rights
holders
could
register
their
copyright
claims
for
books
.
google
also
offered
to
share
future
revenues
with
authors
and
publishers
,
as
well
as
sell
full


text
access
to
out


of


print
books
unless
an
author
opted
out
.
a
judge
threw
out
the
settlement
,
arguing
that
this
would
give
google
a
near
monopoly
on
the
millions
of
still


copyrighted


orphan



works
,
where
the
rightsholder
can



t
be
located
.

while
the
decision
was
controversial
,
had
it
gone
differently
it
would
have
solved
many
of
the
problems
we
see
today
,
including
creating
access
to
the
vast
majority
of
digitized
books
that
are
out
of
print
but
under
copyright
.
google
was
willing
to
make
as
many
out-of-print
,
copyrighted
books
as
accessible
as
possible
and
,
critically
,
to
create
infrastructure
that
would
allow
opt-out
processes
to
scale
.

google
won
on
fair
use
exception
grounds
,
but
the
victory



at
least
for
those
who
dreamed
of
a
universal
library



proved
pyrrhic
.
the
judge
ruled
that
letting
end
users
see


snippets



constituted
a
transformative
public
good
that
didn



t
compete
with
book
sales
.
some
google
competitors
and
antitrust-focused
groups
claimed
a
win
,
but
the
ruling
meant
that
,
once
again
,
it
would
be
up
to
congress
to
create
a
new
legal
vehicle
for
dealing
with
out-of-print
copyrighted
books
,
including
orphan
works
.
congress
hasn



t
moved
anything
forward
since
.

more
recently
,
the
internet
archive
faced
its
own
fair
use
exception
lawsuit
in
2020
.
the
internet
archive
was
one
of
many
libraries
and
content
platforms
that
had
been
experimenting
with
a
new
,
legally
unsettled
approach
to
lending
scanned
books
called
controlled
digital
lending
,
in
which
libraries
replace
a
physical
copy
of
a
resource
they
own
with
a
digital
copy
in
a


one
for
one



approach
.
for
example
,
if
a
library
owns
one
physical
copy
of
moby
dick
,
in
a
cdl
model
the
library
would
scan
the
book
and
lend
the
digital
copy
made
to
one
patron
at
a
time
while
also
removing
the
original
physical
copy
of
the
novel
from
circulation
.

but
the
internet
archive
veered
wildly
away
from
a
measured
approach
to
cdl
when
in
march
2020
,
during
covid
library
closures
,
it
enacted
a
short-lived


national
emergency
library



for
its
scanned
books
.
for
a
few
months
,
the
emergency
library
allowed
everyone
to
simultaneously
borrow
the
same
scan
,
abandoning
the
cdl
one-copy
,
one-user
model
.
in
response
,
a
group
of
major
publishers
filed
a
lawsuit
(
hachette
book
group
,
inc
.
v
.
internet
archive
)
.
in
march
2023
,
a
federal
court
held
that
the
internet
archive



s
scanning-and-lending
program
was
not
fair
use
.
an
appeal
by
the
internet
archive
was
overruled
.

the
way
forward
these
lawsuits
on
fair
use
exceptions
to
core
copyright
law
remain
the
dominant
frame
for
public
conversations
about
digital
book
access
.
but
it



s
the
wrong
way
to
think
about
it
.
we
don



t
have
to
overhaul
copyright
law
,
or
parameters
of
fair
use
,
to
solve
the
problem
of
access
to
most
digitized
books
.
we
do
need
a
practical
framework
to
make
them
available
through
new
licensing
exceptions
and
governance
in
cases
where
they
are
commercially
unavailable
.

how
big
is
this
problem
?
the
most
common
estimate
is
that
70%
of
all
digitized
books
are
neither
in
the
public
domain
nor
commercially
available
in
print
.
google
has
never
published
an
up


to


date
rights
breakdown
of
its
books
corpus
,
and
the
only
hard
numbers
google
put
on
the
public
record
came
in
during
the
lawsuit
,
when
the
first
seven


million
library


scanned
books
were
under
scrutiny
.
of
these
,
about
one
million
were
public
domain
,
one
million
were
under
copyright
and
in
print
,
and
the
remaining
five
million
were
under
copyright
but
out
of
print
,
including
many
orphan
works
.
no
one
has
a
clean
way
to
license
these
,
so
they
sit
in
legal
limbo
,
inaccessible
to
everyone



except
,
perhaps
,
gemini
.

what



s
needed
for
the
70%
is
a
new
common-sense
licensing
framework
:
a
limited
,
opt-out
system
that
lets
a
trusted
body
grant
permission
to
use
books
no
longer
on
sale
,
without
taking
away
the
authors



rights
so
there



s
a
clear
,
reliable
way
to
make
them
available
.
a
new
collective
license
model
wouldn



t
please
copyleft
activists
who
want
to
reform
copyright
altogether
and
would
require
some
extra
work
from
key
groups
to
create
processes
for
opt-outs
.
but
it
would
better
serve
almost
everyone
else
in
the
space
,
including
librarians
(
like
myself
)
,
who
want
to
provide
legal
and
low-risk
access
to
their
patrons
and
,
of
course
,
readers
.

the
eu
implemented
exactly
this
kind
of


out-of-commerce



framework
in
its
2019
digital
single
market
directive
,
which
was
designed
to
create
efficient
online
business
operations
across
all
eu
member
states
.
this
included
an


out-of-commerce
works



regime
that
allows
cultural
heritage
institutions
to
make
such
works
available
online
once
a
license
has
been
issued
or
if
the
rightsholder
hasn



t
opted
out
of
a
public
notice
.
in
practice
,
this
means
that
if
a
work
isn



t
available
through
the
ordinary
marketplace
,
cultural
heritage
institutions
like
libraries
can
work
with
a
collective
management
organization
(
the
us
equivalent
of
this
would
be
the
copyright
clearance
center
)
to
make
them
available



unless
the
rightsholder
opts
out
.

to
do
this
in
the
us
,
congress
would
have
to
pass
a
new
standard
collective
license
framework
.
this
would
allow
institutions
like
libraries
and
archives
to
make
digital
versions
of
in-copyright
,
out-of-commerce
books
in
their
collections
available
for
reading
online
.
the
copyright
clearance
center
would
be
the
obvious
group
to
manage
the
opt-out
registry
and
license
admin
,
and
libraries
themselves
to
surface
the
content



the
same
major
research
libraries
that
worked
with
google
and
other
organizations
to
scan
their
books
.

this
is
a
complex
but
surmountable
task
.
the
copyright
clearance
center
would
need
to
build
a
registry
,
a
portal
for
posting
notices
and
opt-outs
,
and
a
process
to
notify
libraries
about
opt-outs
.
the
work
required
of
libraries
would
be
low
to
moderate
,
depending
on
how
automated
the
opt-out
workflow
would
be
.

this
new
model
would
deliver
what
the
proposed
google
books
settlement
got
right
,
including
a
rights
registry
and
opt-outs
.
but
we
wouldn



t
need
a
single
private
tech
platform
in
charge
to
build
it
.
and
crucially
,
we
wouldn



t
have
to
rewrite
the
core
of
us
copyright
,
including
who
owns
what
and
how
long
it
lasts
,
or
expand
definitions
of
fair
use
.

if
this
all
sounds
unrealistic
,
it



s
first
worth
noting
that
the
copyright
office
outlined
just
such
an
approach
for
mass
books
digitization
in
2015
(
copyright
clearance
center
ccc
.
pdf
)
,
issuing
a
report
recommending
that
congress
authorize
a
pilot
for
exactly
this
type
of
extended
collective
licensing
.
congress
didn



t
act
.

these
licenses
exist
for
other
media
in
the
us
.
the
music
industry
long
had
a
compulsory
license
laid
out
in
section
115
of
the
us
copyright
act
,
which
guarantees
anyone
the
right
to
reproduce
and
distribute
a
nondramatic
musical
work
as
long
as
they
follow
the
statutory
rules
and
pay
a
set
royalty
.
(
this
was
most
recently
updated
in
2021
by
the
music
modernization
act
in
2018
,
which
replaced
the
original
song


by


song


notice
of
intention



system
with
a
blanket
licence
for
streaming
and
downloads
.
)
finally
,
we
are
already
living
in
a
moment
when
new
type
content
licenses
for
books
are
being
churned
out
at
speed
.
the
publishing
industry
is
currently
scrambling
to
develop
new
licensing
models
for
full-text
book
access
as
lucrative
data
sources
for
ai
.
just
this
september
,
anthropic
agreed
to
pay
$1
.
5
billion
to
authors
and
publishers
after
a
judge
found
it
illegally
downloaded
millions
of
copyrighted
books
from
pirate
libraries
like
library
genesis
.
about
500
,
000
authors
will
receive
$3
,
000
per
work
.

if
we
can
negotiate
grand
bargains
to
keep
feeding
the
machines
books
,
surely
we
can
design
a
rational
,
lean
,
humane
licence
that
lets
living
,
breathing
readers
borrow
a
digital
copy
of
a
work
that
they
can



t
buy
.

the
universal
library
is
near
,
but
it



s
up
to
us
to
ensure
that
humans

not
just
ais
,
have

days
before

national

,
texas
a&m
opposite
hitter
logan

posted
an
old
family
video
on
her
instagram
account
.
lednicky
is
maybe
5
or
6
years
old
in
the
video
,
wearing
a
maroon
a&m
shirt
and
doing
cartwheels
on
the
grass
at

implores

and
little
logan
walks
up
to
the
camera
,
smiles
and
gives
a
thumbs-up
.

under
the
video
,
lednicky
wrote
that
she
is
living
in
that
little
aggie
'
s
"answered
prayers
.
"
her
dad
,
kyle
,
was
a
long
snapper
for
the
texas
a&m
football
team
in
the
1990s
,
and
her
mom
worked
in
the
football
office
.
she
chose
texas
a&m
because
she
always
dreamed
of
being
a
fourth-generation
aggie
,
but
that
was
only
part
of
it
.
she
wanted
to
help
build
a
middling
volleyball
program
into
a
powerhouse
.

lednicky
went
beyond
that
little
girl

sunday
,
swatting
11
kills
to
lead
texas

to

logan
lednicky
said
it
was
her
goal
to
elevate
the
texas
a&m
program
,
but
the
national
championship
was
"beyond
my
wildest
dreams
.
"
scott
winters/icon
sportswire
in
the
final
four
matches
of
her
career
,
when
it
mattered
most
,
lednicky
amassed
69
total
kills
,
a
team
high
.
she
'
s
one
of
four
seniors
who
have
been
with
the
program
from
the
beginning
--
they
went
13-16
as
freshmen
--
and
set
the
tone
for
the
historic
season
.
the
past
and
present
swirled
through
that
class
sunday
.
with
the
aggies
cruising
in
the
final
set
,
coach
jamie
morrison
high-fived
lednicky
,
and
hung
on
to
her
hand
.

"i
think
she
had
that
moment
where
,
'
this
might
be
the
last
four
points
of
my
college
career
,
'
"
morrison
said
.
"i
think
she
actually
started
getting
a
little
teary
on
the
court
.
i
was
like
,
'
oh
,
no
,
did
i
just
ruin
everything
?
'
no
,
it
means
the
world
.

"there
was
a
group
of
them
here
from
the
beginning
that
said
,
'
i
want
to
be
a
part
of
this
,
i
want
to
build
this
program
.
'
.
.
.
i
don
'
t
think
they
were
envisioning
a
national
championship
by
the
time
they
were
done
.
i
think
when
we
were
selling
what
we
were
doing
,
it
was
building
something
they
could
come
back
to
in
the
future
and
be
really
,
really
proud
they
helped
build
.
"
it
was
lednicky
who
helped
save
the
season
on
dec
.
13
in
the
sweet
16
,
when
the
aggies
were
down
two
sets
to
louisville
.
she
hammered
a
team-high
20
kills
in
a
reverse
sweep
,
and
afterward
,
lednicky
mentioned
a
random
note
that
someone
left
on
the
scorer
'
s
table
as
her
team
was
teetering
toward
elimination
.

the
note
said
,
"something
great
is
about
to
happen
.
"
she
has
always
been
the
charismatic
optimist
--
the
one
who
keeps
things
loose
.
teammates
call
her
everything
from
their
"ride-or-die"
to
a
best
friend
.

she
has
been
a
recruiter
.
when
morgan
perkins
hit
the
transfer
portal
after
her
freshman
season
at
oklahoma
three
years
ago
,
her
first
text
came
from
lednicky
,
an
old
club
teammate
.
perkins
said
the
text
was
something
along
the
lines
of
,
"hey
,
mo-mo
,
i
see
you
'
re
in
the
portal
.
.
.
"
lednicky
,
along
with
sophomore
kyndal
stowers
,
helped
pull
a&m
together
when
the
wildcats
sprinted
out
to
a
15-9
lead
in
the
first
set
.
the
aggies
later
said
they
dealt
with
some
jitters
at
the
start
of
the
match
,
but
it
was
short-lived
.
lednicky
'
s
kill
drew
a&m
within
one
,
and
then
she
teamed
up
with
perkins
for
a
block
that
tied
the
game
.

stowers
'
kill
completed
the
rally
and
gave
the
aggies
the
set
,
26-24
.

from
there
,
the
aggies
dominated
.
they
took
a
commanding
19-8
lead
in
the
second
and
pulled
away
in
the
third
with
a
lednicky
kill
that
made
it
18-11
.

"i
was
pretty
emotional
all
day
today
,
"
lednicky
said
,
"just
knowing
that
no
matter
the
outcome
of
this
game
,
it
would
be
my
last
getting
to
represent
a&m
on
my
chest
.
being
able
to
do
this
with
these
girls
--
end
like
this
,
i
just
can
'
t
even
believe
it
.

"i
'
m
so
happy
i
get
to
carry
this
with
me
through
the
rest
of
my
life
and
remember
all

in
the
waning
moments
of
the
match
,
a
corner
of
the
arena
chanted
,
"why
not
us
?
"
it
became
a
slogan
for
the
aggies
in
the
postseason
,
during
the
match
against
louisville
.
late
sunday
,
lednicky
gave
a
shoutout
to
her
boyfriend
and
teammate
ava
underwood
'
s
boyfriend
for
coining
it
for
the
aggies
at
a
concession
stand
in
lincoln
,
nebraska
.

"we
kind
of
took
it
and
ran
with
it
,
"
she
said
.
"we
started
saying
it
.

ava
and
addi
(
applegate
)
wrote
it
on
their
shoe
.
now
it
'
s
on
a
t-shirt
somehow
.
shout
out
to
them
.

"but
,
i
mean
,
it
'
s
true
.
it
'
s
a
testament
to
the
hard
work
this
program
has
put
in
all
year
long
,
staff
,
players
.
that
'
s
such
a
great
statement
.
'
why
not
us
'
has
turned
into
,
'
it
is
us
'
.
i
think
with
that
dawg
mentality
all
season
long
,
all
tournament
long
,
we
knew
it
was
going
to
be
us
.
"
morrison
,
who
came
to
a&m
in
december
2022
and
overhauled
the
program
'
s
culture
,
figured
it
would
take
at
least
five
years
to
win
it
all
.
he
credited
the
rapid
ascent
to
his
team
'
s
work
ethic
.

kyle
lednicky
waited
for
his
daughter
after
the
match
,
marveling
over
how
she
and
her
teammates
set
out
to
change
a
program
and
did
it
so
quickly
,
and
dramatically
.
he
said
former
a&m
football
coach
r
.
c
.

slocum
texted
her
sunday
morning
and
wished
her
luck
.

"that
was
pretty
cool
,
"
kyle
lednicky
said
.

of
course
he
always
hoped
his
daughter
would
go
to
his
alma
mater
,
but
he
says
he
never
put
pressure
on
her
.
maybe
it
was
osmosis
,
that
all
those
football
games
,
and
that
maroon
clothing
,
would
eventually
seep
into
her
consciousness
,
and
her
heart
.
it
didn
'
t
matter
.
that
fourth-generation
aggie
is
now
a
first-generation
champion
.

kyle
lednicky
saw
his
daughter
'
s
instagram
post
thursday
,
and
it
brought
back
a
flood
of
memories
.

"i
had
to
put
it
away
,
"
he
said
,
"because
i
got
teary-eyed
when
i
was
looking
at
it
.

despite
making
a
series
of
moves
to
reinforce
the
lineup
and
the
bullpen
,
the
new
york
mets
have
yet
to
really
address
the
rotation
.

since
the
detroit
tigers
have
said
they
would
listen
to
offers
for
ace
tarik
skubal
,
there
is
a
chance
they
have
talked
to
the
mets
.

no
deal
appears
imminent
,
though
,
as
it



s
unlikely
they
trade
the
best
pitcher
in
baseball
.
meanwhile
,
the
mets
also
seem
to
be
losing
hope
of
landing
cody

most
intriguing
path
to

runs
straight
through
detroit
,
where
skubal



s
future
remains
quietly
unresolved
.
while
the
tigers
continue
to
signal
they
want
to
keep
their
ace
,
skubal



s
impending
free
agency
creates
a
narrow
but
real
window
for
a

exactly
what
david

would
need
to
strike
before
the

elite
value
for

skubal
isn

just
another
frontline
starter



he



s
a
transformational
force
.
his
dominance
in
2025
placed
him
among
the
most
overpowering
pitchers
in
modern
baseball
,
backed
by
elite
command
,
swing-and-miss
stuff
,
and
underlying
metrics
that
scream
sustainability
.
adding
him
would
instantly
change
the
mets



identity
,
turning
a
hopeful
rotation
into
one
capable
of
carrying
a
deep
postseason
run

it



s
a

a
potential
one-year

it



s
also
the
kind
of
gamble
that
can
alter
a
franchise



s
trajectory
.
for
a
team
chasing
championships
rather
than
comfort

skubal
represents

despite
internal

the

lived
a
thousand
lives
,
including
forging
a
national
destiny
that
algiers
has
been
trying
to
bring
to
the
big
screen
since
the
1970s
.
during
a
meeting
on
december
8
,
president
abdelmadjid
tebboune
revived
the
project
to
produce
a
feature
film
on
the
extraordinary
life
of
the
man
known
as
the
"greatest
enemy
of
france
.
"
this
decision
carries
strong
political
symbolism
,
as
relations
between
paris
and
algiers
have
entered
a
period
of
unprecedented
tension
since
algeria
'
s
independence
.
the
latest
episode
in
this
fraught
relationship
unfolded
on
december
24
,
when
algerian
lawmakers
passed
a
law
criminalizing
colonization

france
promptly
denounced
this
as

respected

,
el-kader
was
the
iconic
leader
of
algerian
resistance
to
the
french
conquest
in
the
19^th
century
.
for
15
years
,
he

armies

era

surrender
in

while
in

,
he
took
up
arms
to
save
the
lives
of
several
thousand
christians
threatened
by
persecution
from
the
druze
.
this
act
earned
him
worldwide
recognition
,
from

ix
to
american

.
his
humanism
was
celebrated
in

,
2012
,
south
korean
pop
culture
giant
yg
entertainment
posted
a
cryptic
photo
to
their
official
blog
.
in
the
image
,
a
girl
looks
off-camera
,
dressed
in
a
pink-and-white
checkered
shirt
,
with
auburn
streaks
running
through
her
black
hair
.
simply
titled


who



s
that
girl
?
?
?
,



the
breadcrumb
was
part
of
a
teaser
campaign
for
a
forthcoming
new
girl
group
.
one
month
later
,
a
youtube
video
with
the
same
name
appeared
online


a
one-minute
,
36-second
hypnotic
clip
of
trainees
dancing
in
the
shadows
,
except
for
one
girl
,
illuminated
in
a
tight
spotlight
as
she
performs
,
her
face
too
distant
to
capture
,
her
dance
movements
too
precise
and
charismatic
to
ignore
.
the
video
has
since
been
viewed
nearly
twenty-four
million
times
.
finally
,
on
august
29th
of
the
same
year
,
yg
unveiled
the
girl
in
question
:
jennie
kim
(


제니
)
,
a
sixteen-year-old
trainee
fluent
in
korean
,
english
,
and
japanese
.
fast
forward
13
years
,
and
jennie
is
one
of
the
most
famous
women
in
the
world
.
yet
visibility
is
not
the
same
as
transparency
;
despite
being
everywhere
,
she
remains
,
in
some
ways
,
just
as
elusive
as
that
shadowed
girl
in
the
teaser
.
so
,
who
is
that
girl
with
89
million
instagram
followers
?
it



s
a
mystery
sustained
not
by
secrecy
,
but
by
evolution


jennie
is
always
in
motion
,
and
always
beginning
again
.

i
can



t
believe
i



m
still
saying
this
,



jennie
begins
over
zoom
from
manila
,
philippines
,
just
days
after
our
cover
shoot
in
los
angeles
,


because
it



s
something
i
said
a
year
ago
before
my
first
album
[ruby]
,
but
i
feel
like
a
baby
stepping
into
the
world
.



that
curiosity
and
wide-eyed
wonder
regarding
her
career



s
possibilities
remain
a
constant
throughout
our
conversation


childlike
,
but
never
childish
.
though
she
jokes
,


you



re
not
allowed
to
say
that
!



when
i
mentioned
her
forthcoming
thirtieth
birthday
,
she
speaks
of
the
new
decade
with
a
spirit
of
inquiry
rather
than
dread
.


i
just
can



t
wait
for
this
new
chapter
of
mine
to
open
,
not
because
i



m
entering
my
30s
,
but
because
there
are
just
so
many
exciting
things
that
i



ve
planned
ahead
,



she
explains
.


i
feel
like
i
lived
my
20s
with
passion
and
love
.



she
also
lived
them
with
a
fastidious
work
ethic
(
blackpink
has
sold
over
20
million
records
worldwide
and
was
the
first
k-pop
girl
group
to
dominate
charts
in
the
west
,
with
her
aforementioned
debut
solo
album
debuting
in
the
top
10
in
19
countries
)
.


as
far
as
i
know
,
i



m
going
to
be
in
tokyo
.
i



m
going
to
have
a
show
the
night
of
my
birthday
,
and
that
whole
week
too
,



she
says


a
fitting
celebration
for
someone
whose
dedication
borders
on
superhuman
.

in

model
named
polly

becomes
the

of

all
determined
to
uncover
her


true
self
.



the
more
they
search

the
more

disappears
beneath
projections
of
beauty
and
desire
.


every
time

take
my
picture
,

sighs
,


there

less
of
me
left

jennie



s
career
,
too
,
has
unfolded
beneath
an
unblinking
camera
eye
.

yet
what
distinguishes
her
from
klein



s
tragic
mannequin
is
agency
.
she
has
learned
to
command
the
lens
rather
than
be
consumed
by
it
.
if
polly
maggoo
dissected
a
culture
that
devoured
its
idols
,
jennie
represents
a
generation
of
artists
reclaiming
authorship
over
their
image
.


through
my
debut
album
ruby
,
which
came
out
this
year


although
it
feels
like
four
years
ago


it
was
a
great
way
for
me
to
explore
new
sounds
and
just
rediscover
myself
and
my
love
for
music
,
and
find
new
ways
to
approach
it
,



she
says
.


the
decisions
,
the
thought
process
,
and
ideas
are
coming
100%
from
me
.
it
feels
like
i
own
everything
.
so
it
definitely
taught
me
how
to
talk
to
myself
.



thus
,
while
jennie


like
polly


finds
herself
surrounded
by
stylists
eager
to
dress
her
,
makeup
artists
to
glam
her
,
and
producers
to
shape
her
sound
,
she
is
no
passive
canvas
,
but
an
active
hand
in
her
own
creation
.

with
new
solo
music
coming
this
year
,
jennie
is
deciding
how
her
future
will
look


and
sound
.


i
honestly
have
no
clue
what
it



s
gonna
look
like
yet
.
i
am
a
very
open
book
right
now
,



she
admits
.


i



m
excited
to
get
deeper
with
my
vocals
for
sure
.
and
this
was
homework
of
mine
from
the
beginning
,
but
blending
korean
and
english
into
my
music
,
too
.



perhaps
surprisingly
,
given
her
refined
and
immaculate
public
image
,
she
speaks
of
horror
and
thriller
films
as
new
terrain
for
inspiration
.


i
just
watched
the
movie
weapons
.
have
you
watched
it
?



she
asks
.


i



ve
always
been
a
fan
of
horror
and
thriller
movies
.
i
love
the
aesthetics
.
i



ve
also
watched
(
guillermo

toro



s
)
frankenstein
,
which
is
in
that
world
.
something
about
the
dark
,
mysterious
places
and
visuals
in
those
films
always
inspired
me
to
get
into
it
more
.
maybe
that
could
be
something
that
i
could
embrace
in
my
own
creativity
.

as
far
as
who
jennie
will
be
,
she
remains
open
to
exploring
various
creative
mediums
.


i
see
lots
of
artists
directing
their
own
things
or
designing
their
own
costumes
to
wear
in
their
videos
.
i
want
to
say
,
although
i
don



t
know
if
i



m
allowed
to
say
this
,
but
i
love
fashion
and
would
love
to
design
something
for
myself
.



of
course
,
the
world
of
fashion
loves
her
right
back


jennie
is
a
style
icon
and
fashion
week
fixture
,
her
presence
at
chanel



s
front
row
regularly
creating
such
a
frenzy
that
even
polly
magoo
would
be
jealous
.

even
in
her
downtime
away
from
the
flashing
bulbs
,
jennie
is
a
curious
being
.


i
really
don



t
know
if
i
should
say
this
,



she
begins
timidly
,


but
i



m
on
the
plane
half
of
the
time
and
in
the
car
or
getting
glam
,
so
i



ve
been
playing
nintendo
switch
.
animal
crossing
,
zelda
,
and
mario
kart
.
everyone
knows
i



m
not
a
professional
at
it
,
but
you
know
,
it
takes
everything
off
my
mind
.



when
i
remind
her
that
she
doesn



t
have
to
be
a
master
of
this
pastime
,
she
interjects
:


that



s
the
thing


once
i
get
really
deep
into
it
,
i
want
to
become
a
professional
.
so
i



m
very
invested
in
these
games
right
now
.



sometimes
,
a
strong
work
ethic
can



t
help
but
infringe
on
good
ol



fashioned
fun

there
will
be
no
shortage
of
planes
or
cars
for
jennie
this
month
as
she
and
the
rest
of
blackpink
conclude
their
deadline
world
tour
.
she
speaks
of
returning
to
the
stage
after
a
three-year
hiatus
with
a
surprising
sense
of
comfort
,
although
not
immediately
:


obviously
,
all
of
us
were
not
afraid
,
but
we
didn



t
know
what
to
expect
going
back
into
the
group
and
being
on
tour
after
three
years
.



when
asked
if
it
felt
like
a
homecoming
,
as
well
as
how


home



had
changed
,
she
says
,


nothing
has
really
changed
,
but
also
,
we



ve
all
released
solo
albums
,
too
.
so
being
able
to
bring
different
music
into
our
sets
and
watching
each
other



s
performances
from
a
new
perspective
was
a
new
thing
for
us
,
which
made
it
more
fun
.



despite
her
own
solo
music
and
that
of
her
counterparts
(
lisa
,
jisoo
,
and
rosé


all
,
as
with
jennie
,
mononymous
like
madonna
)
,
the
girls
do
not
act
as
though
they
are
in
competition
.



overall
,
being
back
on
stage
with
all
of
us
together
felt
very
much
like
home
.
when
you
don



t
go
home
for
a
year
because
of
work
or
whatever
,
and
you
go
back
,
and
it
still
feels
like
home


it



s
that
kind
of
feeling
where
you
don



t
need
to
expect
anything
.
your
body
knows
that
you



re
home
.

,
jennie



s


home



is
one
of
massive
success
,
though
she
still
grapples
with
how
to
define
the
word
.


that



s
a
serious
question
that
i
ask
myself
every
day
,



she
says
.


but
for
me
,
i
think


getting
to
look
at
my
own
dedication
to
something
that
i
made
and
whatever
is
being
shared
with
the
world
,
and
if
i
feel
proud
of
it
,
if
i
feel
like
it



s
mine
,
that



s
the
moment
where
i



m
like
,
you
know
,


i



m
doing
great
,
and
i
feel
like
my
life



s
good
.





she
pauses
,
then
adds
:


if
someone
asked
me
how
i



m
handling
my
success
,
i
would
say
i



m
not
.
but
i
am
proud
of
how
far
i



ve
come
.
i



m
proud
of
all
the
work
i



ve
made
.

just
the
fact
that
i
get
to
look
back
at
myself
,
dream
bigger
,
and
keep
going


that



s
my
way
of
handling
life
.



where
polly
maggoo
ends
in
existential
uncertainty
,
its
protagonist
wandering
the
lonely
streets
of
paris
,
jennie



s
story
lands
on
evolution
.
the
ambiguity
persists


not
as
absence
,
but
as
freedom
.
we
may
never
fully
know
who
jennie
kim
is
,
and
perhaps
that



s
the
point
,
because
she
is
a
shapeshifter
not
lost
in
the
gaze
but
guiding
it
.
in
a
world
still
obsessed
with
unmasking
its
icons
,
jennie



s
remains
a
mystery
,
but
unlike
magoo
,
it



s
one
of
her
own
making
.

on
a
frigid
day
after
mass
at
st
.
ann



s
catholic
church
in
rural
nebraska
,
worshippers
shuffled
into
the
basement
and
sat
on
folding
chairs
,
their
faces
barely
masking
the
fear
gripping
their
town
.

a
pall
hung
over
the
room
just
as
it
hung
over
the
holiday
season
in
lexington
,
nebraska
.



suddenly
they
tell
us
that
there



s
no
more
work
.
your
world
closes
in
on
you
,



said
alejandra
gutierrez
.

she
and
the
others
work
at
tyson
foods
'
beef
plant
and
are
among
the
3
,
200
people
who
will
lose
their
jobs
when
lexington
'
s
biggest
employer
closes
the
plant
next
month
after
more
than
two
decades
of
operation
.

hundreds
of
families
may
be
forced
to
pack
up
and
leave
the
town
of
11
,
000
,
heading
east
to
omaha
or
iowa
,
or
south
to
the
meatpacking
towns
of
kansas
or
beyond
,
causing
spinoff
layoffs
in
lexington
'
s
restaurants
,
barbershops
,
grocers
,
convenience
stores
and
taco
trucks
.

3
,
000
jobs
in
a
city
of

12
,
000
people
is
as
big
a
closing
event
as
we

seen
virtually
for

,



said
michael
hicks
,
director
of
the
center
for
business
and
economic
research
at
indiana
'
s
ball
state
university
.
it
will
be


close
to
the
poster
child
for
hard
times
.



all
told
,
the
job
losses
are
expected
to
reach
7
,
000
,
largely
in
lexington
and
the
surrounding
counties
,
according
to
a
report
from
the
university
of
nebraska
,
lincoln
,
released
monday
.
tyson
employees
alone
will
lose
an
estimated
$241
million
in
pay
and
benefits
annually
.

tyson
says
it
'
s
closing
the
plant
to


right-size



its
beef
business
after
a
historically
low
cattle
herd
in
the
u
.
s
.
and
the
company



s
expected
loss
of
$600
million
on
beef
production
next
fiscal
year
.

the
plant
'
s
closure
threatens
to
unravel
a
great
plains
town
where
the
american
dream
was
still
attainable
,
where
immigrants
who
didn
'
t
speak
english
and
never
graduated
high
school
bought
homes
,
raised
children
in
a
safe
community
and
sent
them
to
college
.

now
,
those
symbols
of
economic
progress



mortgages
and
car
payments
,
property
taxes
and
tuition
costs



are
bills
that
thousands
of
tyson
workers
won
'
t
have
an
income
to
pay
.

at
st
.
ann
'
s
church
,
gutierrez
sat
between
her
daughters
and
recalled
being
told
of
the
plant
closure
just
before
thanksgiving
while
she
visited
a
college
campus
with
her
high
school
senior
,
kimberly
.



at
that
moment
,
my
daughter
said
she
no
longer
wanted
to
study
,



gutierrez
said
.


because
where
would
we
get
the
money
to
pay
for
college
?



a
tear
slipped
down
kimberly
'
s
cheek
as
she
looked
at
her
mother
and
then
down
at
her
hands
.

tyson
was
our
motherland



if
you
threw
a
dart
at
a
map
of
the
united
states
,
lexington



called


lex



by
locals



would
be
just
about
bullseye
.

it
'
s
easy
to
miss
driving
down
interstate
80
,
half
hidden
by
barren
hackberry
trees
,
corn
fields
and
pastures
of
black
angus
cattle
,
but
a
driver
can
spy
the
plant
'
s
hulking
industrial
buildings
pumping
steam
.

the
plant
opened
in
1990
and
was
bought
by
tyson
11
years
later
,
attracting
thousands
of
workers
and
nearly
doubling
the
town
'
s
population
within
a
decade
.

many
came
from
los
angeles
,
then
stricken
by
recession
,
including
lizeth
yanes
,
who
initially
hated
what
she
called


a
little
ghost
town
.
"
but
soon
lexington
flourished
,
with
suburbs
sprouting
among
bur
oak
and
american
elm
trees
.
the
downtown
,
a
strip
of
cobblestone
streets
and
brick
buildings
,
has
a
somali
grocer
that
abuts
a
hispanic
bakery
;
locals
attend
over
a
dozen
churches
and
several
city
recreation
centers
.

to
this
day
,
the
plant
creates
the
town
'
s
rhythm
as
workers
roll
on
and
off
the
daily
a
,
b
and
c
shifts
and
fill
restaurants
,
school
pickup
lines
and
the
one-screen
movie
theater
showing


polar
express
.





it
took
a
long
time
for
me
to
actually
enjoy
this
little
place
,



said
yanes
.


now
that
i
enjoy
it
,
now
i
have
to
leave
.



the
atmosphere
inside
the
tyson
plant
,
where
workers
process
as
many
as
5
,
000
head
of
cattle
a
day
,
laboring
on
slaughter
floors
,
cleaning
crews
or
trimming
cuts
of
meat
,
feels


like
a
funeral
,



she
said
.



tyson
was
our
motherland
,
"
said
plant
worker
arab
adan
.
the
kenyan
immigrant
sat
in
his
car
with
his
two
energetic
sons
,
who
asked
him
a
question
he
has
no
answer
to
:


which
state
are
we
gonna
go
,
daddy
?



the
only
thing
adan
is
set
on
is
that
his
kids
finish
the
school
year
in
lexington
,
where
school
officials
say
nearly
half
of
students
have
a
parent
working
for
tyson
.

the
school
district
,
where
at
least
20
languages
and
dialects
are
spoken
,
has
higher
high
school
graduation
and
college
attendance
rates
than
the
state
and
national
average
,
and
one
of
nebraska
'
s
biggest
marching
bands
.
residents
are
proud
of
the
diversity
and
the
tightknit
community
,
where
young
people
return
to
raise
families
.

during
mass
at
st

,

tyson
owes
this
community



the
domino
effect
could
go
something
like
this
:
if
1
,
000
families
skip
town
,
said
economist
hicks



who
wouldn
'
t
be
surprised
if
it
were
double
that



seats
would
be
left
empty
in
schools
,
leading
to
teacher
layoffs
;
there
would
be
far
fewer
customers
in
restaurants
,
shops
and
other
businesses
.

most
of
the
customers
at
los
jalapenos
,
a
mexican
restaurant
down
the
street
from
the
plant
,
are
tyson
workers
.
they
fill
booths
after
work
and
are
greeted
by
owner
armando
martinez



s
mustachioed
grin
and
bellow
of


hola
,
amigo
!



martinez



s
grandson
once
told
his
grandfather
that
when
he
grows
up
he
wants
to
work
at
tyson
.
the
child
'
s
fifth-grade
sister
recently
gathered
with
classmates
to
talk
about
the
changes
happening
with
their
parents
.
some
were
headed
to
california
,
others
to
kansas
.
all
were
in
tears
.

if
he
can
'
t
keep
up
with
bills
,
the
restaurant
will
close
,
but


there



s
just
nowhere
we
can
go
,
"
said
martinez
,
who
undergoes
dialysis
for
diabetes
,
has
an
amputated
foot
and
prays
for
a
miracle
:
that
tyson
will
change
its
mind
.

he
knows
it
'
s
unlikely
.
asked
by
the
associated
press
for
comment
about
plans
for
the
site
,
tyson
said
in
a
statement
that
it


is
currently
assessing
how
we
can
repurpose
the
facility
within
our
own
production
network
.



it
did
not
provide
details
,
or
say
whether
it
plans
to
offer
support
to
the
community
through
the
plant
closure
.

many
,
including
city
manager
joe
pepplitsch
,
are
hoping
tyson
puts
the
plant
up
for
sale
and
a
new
company
comes
in
bringing
jobs
.
that
isn
'
t
a
quick
fix
,
requiring
time
,
negotiations
,
renovations
and
no
guarantee
of
comparable
jobs
.



tyson
owes
this
community
a
debt
.
i
think
they
have
a
responsibility
here
to
help
ease
some
of
the
impact
,



he
said
,
noting
tyson
doesn
'
t
pay
city
taxes
due
to
a
deal
negotiated
decades
ago
.

abandoned
their

to

and
returned

from

by

following

'

the
associated
press
maracay
,
venezuela
--
this
was
not
the
christmas
that
mariela
gómez
would
have
imagined
a
year
ago
.
or
the
one
that
thousands
of
other
venezuelan
immigrants
would
have
thought
.
but
donald
trump
returned
to
the
white
house
in
january
and
quickly
ended
their
american
dream
.

so
gómez
found
herself
spending
the
holiday
in
northern
venezuela
for
the
first
time
in
eight
years
.
she
dressed
up
,
cooked
,
got
her
son
a
scooter
and
smiled
for
her
in-laws
.
hard
as
she
tried
,
though
,
she
could
not
ignore
the
main
challenges
faced
by
returning
migrants
:
unemployment
and
poverty
.



we
had
a
modest
dinner
,
not
quite
what
we



d
hoped
for
,
but
at
least
we
had
food
on
the
table
,



gómez
said
of
the
lasagna-like
dish
she
shared
with
her
partner
and
in-laws
instead
of
the
traditional
christmas
dish
of
stuffed
corn
dough
hallacas
.


making
hallacas
here
is
a
bit
expensive
,
and
since
we



re
unemployed
,
we
couldn



t
afford
to
make
them
.



gómez
,
her
two
sons
and
her
partner
returned
to
the
city
of
maracay
on
oct
.
27
after
crossing
the
u
.
s
.
-mexico
border
to
texas
,
where
they
were
quickly
swept
up
by
u
.
s
.
border
patrol
amid
the
trump
administration



s
crackdown
on
immigration
.
they
were
deported
to
mexico
,
from
where
they
began
the
dangerous
journey
back
to
venezuela
.

they
crossed
central
america
by
bus
,
but
once
in
panama
,
the
family
could
not
afford
to
continue
to
colombia
via
boat
in
the
caribbean
.

instead
,
they
took
the
cheaper
route
along
the
pacific



s
choppy
waters
,
sitting
on
top
of
sloshing
gasoline
tanks
in
a
cargo
boat
for
several
hours
and
then
transferring
to
a
fast
boat
until
reaching
a
jungled
area
of
colombia
.
they
spent
about
two
weeks
there
until
they
were
wired
money
to
make
it
to
the
border
with
venezuela
.

gómez
was
among
the
more
than
7
.
7
million
venezuelans
who
left
their
home
country
in
the
last
decade
,
when
its
economy
came
undone
as
a
result
of
a
drop
in
oil
prices
,
corruption
and
mismanagement
.
she
lived
in
colombia
and
peru
for
years
before
setting
her
sights
on
the
u
.
s
.

with
hopes
of
building
a
new
life
.

trump



s
second
term
has
dashed
the
hopes
of
many
like
gómez
.

as
of
september
,
more
than
14
,
000
migrants
,
mostly
from
venezuela
,
had
returned
to
south
america
since
trump
moved
to
limit
migration
to
the
u
.
s
.
,
according
to
figures
from
colombia
,
panama
and
costa
rica
.
in
addition
,
venezuelans
were
steadily
deported
to
their
home
country
this
year
after
president
nicolás
maduro
,
under
pressure
from
the
white
house
,
did
away
with
his
long-standing
policy
of
not
accepting
deportees
from
the
u
.

share
the
occasion
should
have
been
marked
by
the
joy
of
reaching
the
destination
of
us
citizenship
following
the
long
odyssey
of
immigration
.

instead
,
the
ceremony
at
boston



s
faneuil
hall



renowned
as
a


cradle
of
liberty



for
its
role
as
a
protest
hub
in
the
run-up
to
the
american
revolution



felt
like
a
nightmarish
end
of
the
road
for
some
aspirant
new
americans
who
had
turned
up
full
of
hope
.

before
proceedings
at
this
month



s
event
got
under
way
,
staff
from
the
us
citizenship
and
immigration
service
(
uscis
)
asked
arrivals
expecting
to
swear
the
oath
of
allegiance
that
would
finally
confirm
them
as
citizens
to
state
their
country
of
origin
.

by
the
numbers
:
the
latest
ice
and
cbp
data
on
arrests
,
detentions
and
deportations
in
the
us
read
more
those
from
nations
included
on
a
travel
ban
list
announced
by
donald
trump
last
summer
were
then
excluded
from
taking
part
,
despite
having
completed
the
years-long
vetting
process
.

among
the
disappointed
was
a
haitian
nursing
assistant
in
her
50s
who
had
lived
in
the
us
for
nearly
25
years



denied
what
immigration
specialists
say
is
her
legal
right
by
a
sudden
policy
change
introduced
by
the
trump
administration
on


security



grounds
.

the
woman
declined
an
interview
request
.
but
gail
breslow
,
executive
director
of
boston-based
project
citizenship



which
had
helped
guide
her
citizenship
application



said
she
was
left
devastated
and
distraught
.



our
client
hadn



t
received
uscis



s
written
notification
on
time
and
turned
up
expecting
to
become
a
citizen
,



breslow
said
.


she
told
us
she
was
not
alone
in
this
and
the
same
thing
happened
to
others
.



the
image
of
officers
going
down
a
line
and
asking
people
where
they
were
born
,
and
based
on
the
answer
that
they
gave
,
pulling
them
out
of
line
and
sending
them
home
is
gut-wrenching
.



we
had
another
client
there
the
same
day
from
honduras
who
was
allowed
to
take
part
and
sent
us
pictures
of
his
naturalization
.
people
are
holding
little
flags
and
it



s
a
image
of
pride
and
joy
as
people
are
surrounded
by
family
members



the
contrast
between
that
and
people
being
plucked
out
of
line
based
on
what
country
they



re
from
is
the
most
un-american
image
i
can
conjure
.



the
scene
has
been
replicated
in
venues
elsewhere
in
response
to
a
uscis
memorandum
sent
out
on
5
december
instructing
that
immigration
proceedings
be
paused
for
the
nationals
of
19
countries
on
trump



s
ban
list
.

the
memo
followed
the
shooting
on
26
november
of
two
national
guard
troops
in
washington
dc
,
allegedly
by
an
afghan
national
,
rahmanullah
lakanwal
,
who
had
been
granted
asylum
earlier
this
year
by
the
trump
administration
.



in
light
of
identified
concerns
and
the
threat
to
the
american
people
,
uscis
has
determined
that
a
comprehensive
re-review
,
potential
interview
,
and
re-interview
of
all
aliens
from
high-risk
countries
of
concern
who
entered
the
united
states
on
or
after
january
20
,
2021
is
necessary
,



read
the
memo
,
which
cites
the
shooting
of
the
national
guards
as
a
justification
for
the
review
.

the
memo
prompted
a
flood
of
emails
to
applicants
awaiting
naturalization
informing
them
that
the
ceremonies
had
been
canceled
.



this
is
to
advise
you
that
,
due
to
unforeseen
circumstances
,
we
have
had
to
cancel
the
previously
scheduled
oath
ceremony
on
wednesday
,
december
03
,
2025
at
12
:
30pm
for
the
above
applicant
,



one
typical
email
seen
by
the
guardian
read
.


we
regret
any
inconvenience
this
may
cause

advocacy

,

york
,
los
angeles
,
miami
,
milwaukee
,
houston
,
st
louis
,
omaha
and
elsewhere
.



we
have
seen
these
cases
now
in
over
16
cities
,
affecting
nationalities
that
include
iranians
,
haitian
,
sudanese
,
yemen

,

,

,

just
to

quickly

of
the
countries
[proscribed]
,



said
greg
chen
,
senior
director
for
government
relations
at
the
american
immigration
lawyers
association
.



it



s
sad
we
have
to
do
this



:
the
us
citizens
carrying
passports
out
of
fear
read
more
prohibitions
also
apply
to
green-card
applicants
and
those
applying
for
naturalization
but
who
have
not
yet
reached
the
stage
of
taking
the
oath
of
allegiance
.



we



re
talking
about
[the
cancellation
of]
three
types
of
things



green-card
interviews
,
naturalization
interviews
and
then



an
oath
ceremony
where
it



s
kind
of
finalized
,



said
chen
.

most
of
those
affected
refuse
to
speak
to
the
media
,
fearing
that
publicity
could
make
them
targets
for
reprisals
or
raids
carried
out
by
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
(
ice
)
agents
enforcing
trump



s
immigration
agenda
,
which
has
been
marked
by
mass
deportations
of
undocumented
people
.

however
,
a
libyan
doctor



emailing
the
guardian
anonymously
at
the
request
of
his
lawyer



said
his
green-card
application
had
been
halted
despite
having
worked
in
the
us
for
10
years
after
entering
on
an
o-1/eb-1
(
extraordinary
ability
)
visa
.



i
never
imagined
that
in
the
united
states
i
would
be
targeted
because
of
my
nationality
and
religious
background
,
particularly
by
the
authorities
,



wrote
the
doctor
,
whose
medical
work
is
focused
on
developing
ai
diagnostic
and
treatment
tools
for
lung
cancer
.



i
invested
years
of
relentless
effort
in
this
journey



i
pursued
the
american
dream
in
good
faith
,
believing
in
this
country
as
a
land
of
opportunity
.



now
,
as
i
reach
the
final
stages
of
my
permanent
residency
process
,
an
expensive
and
lengthy
process
,
my
future
appears
jeopardized
solely
because
of
my
country
of
origin
.
i
can



t
describe
to
you
the
uncertainty
,
fear
,
disappointment
and
confusion
i
feel
right
now
.



such
feelings
are
commonplace
among
groups
suddenly
fearing
their
path
to
citizenship
is
shutting
.



we



ve
had
clients
in
tears
asking
us
,
what
did
they
do
wrong
,



said
breslow
of
project
citizenship
,
which
has
seen
21
clients
receive
oath
ceremony
cancellations
and
more
than
200
being
paused
at
an
earlier
stage
.


what
did
they
do
to
deserve
this
?
people
are
very
distraught
.



emotions
are
running
particularly
high
among
afghans
,
nearly
200
,
000
of
whom
arrived
in
the
us
under
the
biden
administration



s
operation
allies
welcome
program
that
followed
the
2021
military
withdrawal
from
afghanistan
.
many
now
feel
singled
out
and
betrayed
after
the
national
guard
shootings
,
according
to
advocates
.



we
feel
guilt
and
shame
that
that
guy
was
part
of
our
community
,



said
fatima
saidi
,
director
of
we
are
all
america
,
a
refugee
and
immigrants
group
.


but
he
was
also
a
part
of
american
militarism
.
he
joined
the
us
army
when
he
was
15
and
was
trained
.



in
fact
,
lakanwal
was
part
of
an
afghan
unit
that
operated
under
cia
direction
.



we
also
feel
guilty
for
other
communities
because
policies
that
are
targeting
afghans
are
also
affecting
them
,



she
added
.


but
the
other
thing
is
just
hopelessness
and
disappointment
,
especially
among
the
afghans
who
came
here
as
allies
.
most
of
them
feel
they
have
done
so
much
for
america
,
the
veterans
and
the
state
department
.



nicole
melaku
,
executive
director
of
the
national
partnership
for
new
americans
,
said
the
collective
demonizing
of
legal
residents
and
citizenship
applicants
had
ominous
portents
.



the
strategy
of
the
administration
began
with
an
assault
on
undocumented
immigrants
,
and
now
he
[trump]
is
going
after
those
with
legal
status
and
trying
to
move
them
into
his
deportation
pipeline
through
administrative
processes
,



she
said
.



everything
here
feels
like
part
of
a
larger
,
ominous
agenda
to
have
exclusion
,
going
back
to
times
where
we
had
the
chinese
exclusion
act
or
other
operations
in
the
1940s
like
sending
people
back
to
mexico
.



her
warning
was
given
added
weight
by
guidance
issued
last
week
to
uscis
field
offices
that
signalled
a
forthcoming
assault
on
the
citizenship
of
americans
already
naturalized
.



i
want
that
escape
route



:
americans
seek
dual
citizenships
under
trump
read
more
the
new
guidance
instructed
offices
to


supply
office
of
immigration
litigation
with
100-200
denaturalization
cases
per
month



during
the
2026
fiscal
year
,
the
new
york
times
reported
,
targets
that
would
amount
to
a
massive
escalation
of
denaturalization
cases
.
by
comparison
,
only
120
were
filed
from
2017
to
2025
.

federal
law
mandates
that
citizenship
can
only
be
withdrawn
if
holders
committed
fraud
while
applying
.
but
a
justice
department
memo
sent
to
its
civil
division
last
june
ordered
denaturalization
cases
to
be
prioritized
and
appeared
to
lay
down
broader
parameters
.



it
says
they



re
going
to
prioritize
denaturalization
cases
against
people
who
furthered
criminal
gangs
,
people
who
committed
felonies
that
were
not
disclosed
,
and
people
who
engaged
in
fraud
against
private
individuals
,



an
immigration
policy
expert
,
speaking
on
condition
of
anonymity
,
said
.


those
categories
don



t
require
criminal
convictions
.



only
certain
cases
can
be
denaturalized
under
the
law
,
although
this
administration
is
trying
to
stretch
the
parameters
of
what
that
means
.



people
who
have
had
their
naturalization
interviews
and
ceremonies
canceled



and
then
also
stripping
citizenship
from
already
naturalized
americans



they



re
like
two
halves
of
the
same
coin
to
make
more
of
our
community
members
subject
to
detention
and
deportation
.

reuters
frazer
clarke
said
he
grew
up
loving
the
sport
and
watching
the
greats
lifting
the
british
heavyweight
title
would
be
the
fullfilment
of
a
dream
for
boxing
champion
frazer
clarke
.

the
staffordshire
fighter
,
an
olympic
bronze
medallist
,
has
been
in
the
gym
"day

,
preparing
for
saturday
'
s
match
against
jeamie
'
tkv
'
tshikevaat
at
derby
'
s
vaillant
arena
.

the
fight
was
originally
scheduled
for
october
,
but
had
to
be
rescheduled
after
tkv
suffered
an
injury
in
training
.

the
34-year-old
from
burton-upon-trent
said
his
training
meant
he
had
barely
seen
his
children
but
they
would
appreciate
it
when
their
dad
became
a
british
champion
.

he
was
still
that
11-year-old
boy
who
used
to
go
on
youtube
and
watch
all
the
greats
,
he
said
,
listing
fighters
such
as
muhammad
ali
,
ricky
hatton
,
lennox
lewis
,
mike
tyson
,
sugar
ray
leonard
and
roy
jones
as
his
inspirations
.

"i
'
m
still
that
kid
inside
,
you
know
this
doesn
'
t
feel
like
work
to
me
,
"
he
said
.

"it
'
s
hard
,
don
'
t
get
me
wrong
,
but
i
still
love
the
sport
.
i
'
m
very
privileged
to
be
able
to
do
my
passion
as
a
living
.

'
the
boxer
won
his
bronze
medal
at
tokyo
in
2020
in
the
men
'

category
.

and
then
defeat
against

anyone
,
in
theory
,
can
attain
the
american
dream
.
but
at
what
price
?

it
now
costs
$5
million
over
a
lifetime
to
fund
eight
key
components
of
the
american
dream
,
including
homeownership
and
raising
children
,
according
to
a
recent
analysis
from
investopedia
.

everyone



s
dream
is
different
.
but
some
human
wants
are
universal
,
as
investopedia
found
in
compiling
its
september
report
.

in
an
accompanying
survey
,
the
financial
journalism
site
asked
1
,
263
adults
to
identify
goals
they
associate
with
the
american
dream
.
most
said
they
shared
these
eight
aspirations
:
*
retiring
in
comfort
(
86%
)
*
affording
quality
health
care
(
86%
)
*
owning
a
home
(
85%
)
*
raising
a
family
(
78%
)
*
owning
a
new
car
(
72%
)
*
going
on
vacation
every
year
(
71%
)
*
caring
for
pets
(
66%
)
*
having
a
wedding
(
55%
)
the
report
tabulates
the
lifetime
costs
of
each
goal
,
tapping
data
from
federal
agencies
,
think
tanks
and
industry
groups
.

here
are
the

,
from

add
them
up
,
and
you
have
a
lifetime
cost
of
$5
,
043
,

for
achieving
the
american
dream
.

that



s
a
daunting
sum
,
considering
the
average
american
with
a
bachelor



s
degree
earns
about
$2
.
8
million
over
a
career
.

the
american
dream
is
getting
more
expensive
on
the
campaign
trail
in
2024
,
presidential
candidate
donald
trump
pledged
to
"bring
back
the
american
dream
.
"



the
numbers
suggest
,
however
,
that
the
dream
is
getting
more
expensive
.

investopedia
found
that
most
components
of
the
american
dream
cost
more
in
2025
than
in
2024
,
when
the
site
last
tallied
costs
.



you



re
definitely
seeing
a
rise
in
prices
pretty
much
across
the
board
,
especially
for
things
like
homeownership
and
raising
kids
and
sending
them
to
college
,



said
caleb
silver
,
chief
business
editor
of
people
inc
.
and
editor-in-chief
of
investopedia
,
speaking
to
usa
today
in
september
.



a
lifetime
supply
of
new
cars
cost
$900
,
346
in
2025
,
versus
$811
,
440
a
year
ago
,
investopedia
found
.
a
lifetime
of
homeownership
costs
$957
,
594
,
up
from
$929
,
955
.

not
everyone
,
however
,
defines
the
american
dream
the
same
way
.

michael
strain
,
a
senior
fellow
at
the
american
enterprise
institute
and
author
of
a
2020
book
about
the
american
dream
,
suggests
investopedia
might
have
set
too
high
a
bar
.



i



m
not
sure
we
should
equate
the
american
dream
with
the
lifestyle
enjoyed
by
the
top
10%
of
income
earners
,



he
said
in
a
september
interview
.

to
strain
,
the
american
dream
is
more
about
a
sense
of
upward
trajectory
:


are
you
getting
ahead
?



he
said
.


are
you
doing
better
year
after
year
?
are
your
kids
going
to
do
better
than
you



ve
done
?



the
point
of
the
investopedia
report
,
silver
said
,
is
to
get
people
thinking
about
how
to
finance
their
own
american
dream
.



we
hope
that
people
will
read
this
and
think
about
what
their
dream
actually
is
,
so
they
can
put
a
price
tag
on
it
and
then
come
up
with
real
strategies
to
be
able
to
earn
enough
money
to
achieve
it
.



here
is
a
detailed
cost
breakdown
of
the
american
dream
:
retirement
:
$1
.
6
million



according
to
investopedia
,
$1
.
64
million
represents
the
average
cost
for
20
years
of
retirement
.
the
tab
is
based
on
average
annual
expenditures
in
retirement
.

a
year
ago
,
investopedia
estimated
the
cost
of
retirement
at
just
under
$1
.
6
million
.

if
those
numbers
seem
high
,
consider
that
financial
advisers
often
instruct
retirees
to
plan
on
spending
only


4%
of
their
savings
on
annual
living
expenses
.
and
4%
of
$1
.
6
million
is
only
$64
,
000
.



homeownership
:
$957
,
594



that
figure
reflects
the
average
cost
of
buying
a
home
and
financing
it
with
a
30-year
fixed-rate
mortgage
,
including
interest
,
insurance
and
property
taxes
.






a
year
ago
,
investopedia
estimated
the
cost
of
homeownership
at
$929
,
955
.

the
median
price
of
an
american
home
is
about
$415
,
000
,
the
report
says
.
the
rest
of
the
lifetime
tab
represents
interest
,
insurance
and
taxes
.



owning
new
cars
:
$900
,
346



this
figure
reflects
the
cost
of
buying
and
financing
a
new
car
every
10
years
from
ages
22
to
75
in
a
two-car
household
.

a

estimated
the

investopedia



s
survey
found
that
72%
of
americans
consider
owning
a
new
car
a
component
of
the
american
dream
.

but
not
everyone
agrees
.
the
average
vehicle
in
the
united
states
is


nearly
13
years
old
,
a
record
high
.



raising
two
kids
:
$876
,
092
that
figure
covers
the
costs
of
raising
two
children
through
age
18
,
then
paying
for
each
to
attend
a
public
college
at
in-state
rates
for
four
years
.






the
total
cost
of
raising
two
children
comes
to
$645
,
819
,
investopedia
estimates
.
college
expenses
push
the
figure
well
past
$800
,
000
.



those
costs
partly
explain
why
fewer
americans
are


choosing
to
have
children
.






health

in

,
investopedia
didn



t
include
health
care
as
a
component
:
it



s
a
need
,
not
a
want
,
right
?

americans
need
health
care
,
but
they
want
quality
health
care
.
most
survey
respondents
said
access
to
quality
health
care
is
part
of
their
american
dream
.

the
total
represents
average
lifetime
health
care
expenditures
from
ages
22
to
85
.

annual
vacations
:
$180
,
621
according
to
the
investopedia
survey
,
most
americans
consider
vacations
a
nonnegotiable
component
of
the
american
dream
.

the
figure
above
represents
one
vacation
a
year
from
ages
22
to
85
,
assuming
the
average
vacation
costs
$2
,
867
.

a
year
ago
,
investopedia
estimated
a
lifetime
of
vacations
costs
$179
,
109
.

owning
pets
:
$39
,
381
two-thirds
of
american
households
have
pets
,
and
most
of
us
consider
our
furry
friends
a
key
piece
of
the
american
dream
.

the
figure
above
represents
lifetime
costs
of
owning
just
one
dog
and
one
cat
,
including
food
and
health
care
.

having
a
wedding
:
$38
,
200
more
than
half
of
americans
say
a
wedding
is
part
of
the
american
dream
.
interestingly
,
wedding
costs
have
actually
declined
since
2024
.

the
$38
,
200
total
covers
a
ceremony
,
reception
and
ring
.

as
a
23-year-old
who
was
playing
national
league
football
as
recently
as
2023
,
max
cleworth
could
have
been
forgiven
if
he
found
the
championship
a
tough
league
to
crack
.

but
the
central
defender
is
the
only
player
in
phil
parkinson
'
s
ranks
to
start
all
18
of
his
side
'
s
matches
in
the
second
tier
so
far
this
season
,
such
is
the
trust
the
coaching
staff
have
in
the
academy
product
.

and
while
nowhere
close
to
retirement
,
cleworth
-
who
has
played
in
different
divisions
in
four
successive
seasons
-
says
the
scale
of
his
own
and
the
club
'
s
recent
achievements
may
not
sink
in
until
he
hangs
up
his
boots
.

"it
'
s
a
bit
mad
to
think
of
,
where
we
were
a
few
years
ago
,
"
he
said
.

"it
'
s
something
that
i
'
ll
probably
look
back
on
once
i
'
ve
retired
and
just
try
and
enjoy
it
at
the
moment
.
"
*
wrexham
afc
wrexham
have
gone
from
strength-to-strength
in
the
championship
,
with
their
last-gasp
draw
against
blackburn
rovers
extending
their
unbeaten
league
run
to
eight
matches
.

following
a
blunt
opening
60
minutes
at
the
stok
cae
ras
,
the
hosts
ended
strongly
and
in
the
fifth
minute
of
added
time
had
cleworth
'
s
calf
to
thank
for
diverting
nathan
broadhead
'
s
shot
into
the
net
.

"i
'
m
going
to
claim
it
even
though
it
was
scruffy
,
"
said
cleworth
.

"i
think
it
'
s
come
off
the
bottom
of
my
calf
in
the
end
.
i
'
m
not
sure
how
it
'
s
come
off
my
calf
but
i
'
ve
tried
to
get
something
on
it
and
thankfully
it
'
s
gone
in
.
"
it
was
the
defender
'
s
first
goal
of
the
campaign
,
and
cleworth
-
who
netted
eight
times
in
league
one
last
term
-
now
hopes
he
can
contribute
more
in
front
of
goal
after
breaking
his
championship
duck
.

"i
'
ve
been
a
bit
frustrated
that
maybe
i
haven
'
t
got
one
or
two
,
"
cleworth
said
.

"i
'
ve
had
a
couple
of
good
chances
that
have
either
not
quite
got
the
connection
or
gone
wide
or
been
saved
,
so
it
'
s
nice
to
finally
get
off
the
mark
and
hopefully
i
'
ll
get
a
few
more

end
,
the
2025-26
season
could
well
be
another
memorable
one
for
the
north

having

cog
in
each
of
his
side
'
s
three
consecutive
promotions
under
hollywood
owners
ryan
reynolds

rob
mcelhenney
,
cleworth
knows
better
than
most
that
the
sky
is
the
limit
for
the
club
at
present
.

"i
don
'
t
see
why
we
can
'
t
be
right
up
there
,
"
declared
cleworth
.

"the
championship
'
s
infamous
for
anyone
beating
anyone
,
so
if
you
can
try
and
be
as
consistent
as
possible
,
you
can
see
yourself
fly
up
the
league
a
bit
,
so
i
don
'
t
think
we
can
put
any
restrictions
on
ourselves
.

"we
can
be
right
up
there
and
hopefully
with
a
few
more
runs
like
this
,
we
could
be
fighting
for
potentially
promotion
,
so
who
knows
.

"we
won
'
t
get
carried
away
with
ourselves
.
it
only
takes
a
few
losses
in
this
league
to
bring
you
straight
back
to
reality
so
we
'
ll
just
focus
on
the
next
game
and
then
the
game
after
that
and
see
where
we
end
up
.

kelly

wipes
away
tears
as
she
cleans
her
restaurant
ahead
of
handing
the
keys
back
to
the
landlord
.

after
eight
years
,
the
newquay
resident
says
"insurmountable"
increases
in
costs
-
from
wages
to
the
price
of
cooking
oil
-
have
led
her
to
make
the
"heartbreaking"
decision
.

it
comes
as
cornwall
chamber
of
commerce
also
warns
businesses
have
"nothing
left
to
give"
ahead
of
the

on
wednesday
.

the

says
"pubs

to

more
to
"incentivise

grow
and
hire
more
people"
,
adding
the
measures
announced
in

"had
not

graham
is

inside

she
is

and

.
the
air
ambulance
service
jen
graham
posts
under
the
name
charity
shop
girl
on
social
media
five
years
ago
,
jen
graham
was
encouraged
by
her
teenage
daughter
to
share
her
favourite
charity
shop
finds
on
social
media
.

pregnant
with
her
younger
daughter
,
the
self-described
second-hand
fashion
addict
had
just
been
made
redundant
from
her
job
at
a
car
dealership
.

fast
forward
to
the
present
day
and
jen
has
nearly
200
,
000
followers
across
instagram
and
tiktok
and
is
currently
filming
for
the
bbc
'
s
new
series
shift
the
thrift
.

"having
something
that
was
a
hobby
and
being
able
to
turn
it
into
a
career
for
a
positive
reason
of
helping
these
charities
is
really
special
,
"
says
the
mother-of-three
,
who
posts
under
the
name
charity
shop
girl
.

'
sharing
styling
tips
'
while
jen
says
she
first
fell
in
love
with
charity
shops
and
the
gems
hidden
within
them
when
she
was
17
,
her
love
of
rummaging
actually
started
much
earlier
.

"my
dad
told
me
that
when
i
was
five
or
six
years
old
he
used
to
take
me
to
the
scrapyard
where
they
sold
clothes
,
bric-a-brac
and
bits
of
furniture
,
"
says
jen
,
who
grew
up
in
the
anfield
area
of
liverpool
and
now
lives
in
sandbach
,
cheshire
.

"i
used
to
love
going
there
and
i
would
buy
the
most
random
stuff
.

"i
loved
going
there
more
than
i
loved
going
to
a
toy
shop
!
"
encouraged
by
her
elder
daughter
,
jen
started
sharing
styling
tips
on
social
media
.

it
was
a
move
born
out
of
necessity
as
well
as
passion
,
though
,
after
she
lost
her
job
.

"i
was
doing
like
one
item
three
ways
,
and
how
i
would
wear
this
item
and
where
i
got
it
from
and
how
much
it
was
,
"
she
says
.

as
her
following
began
to
grow
,
she
started
sharing
the
gems
she
had
discovered
while
sifting
through
the
rails
at
charity
shops
.

"it
just
took
off
from
there
,
"
says
jen
.

her
top
discoveries
include
a
ysl
blazer
for
just
£20
,
a
coach
